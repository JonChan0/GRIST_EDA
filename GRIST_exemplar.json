In these individuals it causes accelerated inflammatory lung damage, is often impossible to treat (with 60-70% treatment failures despite years of combination chemotherapy), and precludes lung transplantation in many US and European centres. The biology of this organism is poorly understood, in particular nothing is known about the genetic determinants of virulence, immune evasion and antibiotic resistance. My plan is to identify genes that impact on intracellular survival, a process our previous work implicated as a key step in M. abscessus pathophysiology. I will employ two orthogonal approaches. The first of these will be to use bacterial GWAS to compare existing whole genome sequencing data with multidimensional in vitro phenotyping. Secondly I plan to utilise a CRISPR-dCas9 knockdown system to generate a high complexity pooled mutant library of M. abscessus, which I can then use for forward genetic functional screening. By comparing input and output pools (using Illumina sequencing), I will be able to identify critical genes potentially responsible for intracellular survival. I plan to prioritise these based on novelty, effect size and whether they are identified by both screens. I will then select several hits to validate further, initially by generating knockout bacteria, complementing with wildtype or polymorphic variant genes, and then evaluating their behaviour in macrophage infection experiments."

It causes increased damage to the lungs, is often impossible to treat (with 60-70% treatment failures despite years of drug therapy), and means that patients may not be able to undergo lung transplantation. The severity of Mycobacterium abscessus infection is influenced by the bacteria\u2019s genetic makeup. I plan to identify genes that allow the bacteria to survive within patients, since we have shown this to be linked to how patients\u2019 bodies deal with the infection. I plan to do this using two methods. The first is to compare data on the bacteria\u2019s genetic make up with how well the bacteria can survive in human cells in the laboratory. The second is to use a gene editing system to pick out individual genes and stop them from functioning, which will enable me to see which genes are critical for survival. Genes which have been identified by both methods, or that have a large impact on bacterial survival, will be investigated further to confirm the effect they have, and their importance for the bacteria\u2019s survival within patients. This will be done using bacteria which have had the relevant genes made inactive."

This project therefore proposes a model to understand and modulate the genetic basis of ARVC severity using mature human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes with an ARVC gene mutation in PKP2 desmosome gene. This combines recent developments in light-responsive CRISPR dCas9 gene-modifying technologies (genome engineering) and the recent applications of light-sensitive biocompatible nanofibers (tissue engineering) in a unique approach for modulating gene responses to exaggerate severity in an ARVC mutant model that mimic patient genotype."

This utilizes advances in light-responsive genetics and biomaterials to create a range of response in ARVC-mutated heart cells, allowing identification of genetic triggers that make the disease more severe, as if they were in the heart.

Enhancer DNAme has been associated with both gene repression and gene activation, but the majority of studies are correlative or focus on single loci and a systematic analysis is currently lacking. I aim to use a novel reporter-screen based approach together with cutting-edge (epi)genomics approaches (capture Hi-C, ChIP-seq, RNA-seq) to determine whether DNA methylation affects (1) enhancer activity and (2) enhancer-promoter looping interactions in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). I will determine the functional effects of enhancer methylation using in vitro differentiation assays and by generating chimeric embryos. Genome wide methylation will be perturbed using DNA methyltransferase knockout cells whilst locus-specific manipulation will be achieved using epigenetic editing techniques (dCas9-TET1 fusion proteins). The proposed research will generate valuable datasets for the fields of epigenetics and development and the principles discovered will be applicable to developmental biology and other scenarios where DNAme is substantially altered, including cancer and aging."

Muscle fibrosis, an associated feature of the disease, causes muscle dysfunction and contributes to the lethal DMD phenotype. This proposal seeks to examine whether upregulation of expression of relaxin can reduce/reverse the skeletal muscle fibrosis associated with DMD, since this peptide hormone of the insulin superfamily is a natural suppressor of age- and disease-related fibrosis in number of other tissues. Enhancement of gene expression is possible using a mutant non-catalytic dead Cas9 (dCas9) through its tethering to transcriptional activators [VP64-p65-Rta (VPR)]. This proposal seeks to explore the potential of CRISPR/Cas9 technology to transcriptionally upregulate expression of relaxin as an anti-fibrotic therapy for DMD using this SP-dCas9-VPR. Guide RNAs targeting upstream of the transcriptional start site of the Rln1 gene will be screened in Cas9-expressing HEK293T cells and the optimal guide RNA then used in conjunction with SP-dCas9-VPR in immortalised DMD patient cells. The effect of this treatment on the transcriptional of Rln1 and also a number of fibrotic genes will be examined using real-time RT-PCR."

Muscle scarring, an associated feature of the disease, causes muscles to no longer function properly and results in death of patients from respiratory and cardiac failure in their thirties. This proposal seeks to examine whether upregulation of a certain hormone known as relaxin can reduce/reverse the skeletal muscle scarring associated with DMD, since it acts as a natural suppressor of age- and disease-related scarring in number of other tissues. This will be examined using a special protein called Cas9 that can be designed to bind to virtually any DNA sequence. This Cas9 protein when joined to other proteins that regulate how genes are read into proteins can be used to activate gene expression. This proposal will design a Cas9 gene activator to target near the sequence that controls the expression of the relaxin gene. The effect of Cas9 gene activator treatment on relaxin expression and also expression of genes that cause fibrosis will be examined in DMD patient muscle cells grown in dishes in the laboratory.&nbsp;</p>"
