The SWS is a rare example of a birth cohort study with data from before conception that has not been obtained by recall. Pre-conceptional recruitment of the women generally resulted in early ascertainment of pregnancy allowing detailed follow-up and fetal scan measurements throughout gestation.||The principal objectives of the SWS are |To characterise the influence of a mothers own fetal growth and of her dietary balance, body composition and endocrine profile before and during pregnancy on: (i) the early trajectory of fetal growth; (ii) the maintenance of this growth trajectory in late gestation; and (iii) placental and fetal adaptive responses, including altered regional blood flow and body composition in the fetus.|To examine how maternal and intrauterine influences interact with the offsprings genes and postnatal environment to determine: (i) weight gain, head growth and linear catch-up growth in infancy; (ii) the pathways of growth and development during childhood that lead to poor adult health; and (iii) cardio-respiratory function and asthma in childhood, as well as levels of risk factors for adult coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus and osteoporosis.||Within the SWS, we have identified strong relationships between educational attainment and the quality of a womans diet when non-pregnant, which in turn is the strongest predictor of the way she feeds her child in infancy. Infants fed according to feeding recommendations tended to have higher lean mass and lower fat mass at age 4 years and to have higher IQs. These findings have led to interventions in women from disadvantaged areas with a view to improving health and lifestyles in women before pregnancy and in those looking after children. Additionally we are working with school children to improve their diets and lifestyles and help them understand the long-term implications for their health and that of their children. Relationships have been found between maternal vitamin D status in pregnancy and bone mineral density in the offspring and this has led to a randomised controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy.||Other findings relate to early lung function development, influences on fetal liver blood flows, risks of depression in young women, placental calcium transport in relation to bone density, and epigenetic processes in early development.

1	Professor Richard Festenstein	Imperial College London	None	2019-03-01	2022-11-30	The UK arm of a multi-centre study of the efficacy and safety of nicotinamide in patients with Friedreich’s ataxia (NICOFA)	Friedreichs ataxia is the most frequent early-onset autosomal recessive hereditary ataxia. It is caused by a pathological expansion of a GAA repeat in the first intron of the frataxin gene (FXN) which is present in 98% of the disease alleles. The expansion of the intronic GAA repeat beyond the pathologic threshold inhibits FXN expression resulting in decreased levels of FXN protein. FXN is a mitochondrial protein involved in the control of iron homeostasis and in the biogenesis of iron–sulphur clusters. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells mean residual levels of FXN are reduced to 36% in typical patients with Friedreichs ataxia. FXN deficiency results in a relentlessly progressive neurodegenerative condition which frequently presents around puberty. Patients gradually lose coordination become dysarthric and are frequently wheel-chair bound as adolescents. There is no disease modifying therapy and many patients die prematurely of cardiomyopathy. It has been demonstrated that GAA-triplet repeats can trigger abnormal compaction of a linked reporter gene in vivo leading to the archetypal epigenetic gene silencing phenomenon of position effect variegation (PEV) (Saveliev 2003). This GAA-repeat silencing was exquisitely sensitive to the gene dosage of PEV modifiers which encode enzymes that modify chromatin. It was subsequently found that the FXN gene is silenced at the chromatin level by the formation of heterochromatin and that this heterochromatin formation can be antagonised by histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) (Chan 2013). A recent proof-of-concept clinical study with Friedreich’s ataxia demonstrated that FXN levels can be restored to normal levels using the class III HDACi nicotinamide at a dose that is well tolerated by patients (Libri 2014). Therefore restoration of FXN expression to normal levels might be expected to halt disease progression. Nicotinamide readily crosses the blood brain barrier and has previously been given at high doses for long periods to normal individuals without serious adverse effects (Gale 2004; Knip 2000). This study addresses this hypothesis in the form of a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled parallel group study for clinical efficacy. The primary endpoint is the stabilisation of the neurological condition compared to the control group using the scale for assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA) which has been validated by our previous natural history study for this condition (Reetz 2015 and 2016). Further measures will assess quality of life motor function and cognition cardiac function as well as brain alteration. This study will be the first to provide clinical evidence for the efficacy and safety of nicotinamide in patients with Friedreich’s ataxia. The tight collaboration over several years between UCL (Giunti) and Imperial (Festenstein) in part through the European Friedreichs Ataxia Consortium for Translational Studies (EFACTS) has been instrumental in developing this novel therapeutic approach. Importantly we have idenitfied patients by interrogating the extensive UCL-EFACTS database. The exploratory study which seeded the current application was greatly faciltated by the NIHR Imperial Clinical Research Facility (Libri).

Our goal is to understand how this parasite multiplies in the human bloodstream, thereby causing the disease. The objectives are to understand erythrocyte invasion by the malaria parasite, focusing on the human parasite Plasmodium falciparum and the merozoite form that invades red blood cells. In particular the aims are (i) to define the role of a merozoite surface protein complex in invasion, and develop experimental vaccines based on these molecules, (ii) to investigate the importance of parasite organelle proteins in invasion, and (iii) to understand the molecular motor that drives the invasion process. The study of proteins on the merozoite surface has shown that a component of a multimolecular complex (largely formed by proteolytic processing of merozoite surface protein 1, MSP1) is the target of antibodies that prevent parasite invasion of erythrocytes, and this protein component is now one of the leading candidates for development as a vaccine against malaria. In collaboration with groups in Nigeria studies with human antibodies have reinforced this conclusion. Using a variety of methods, we have analysed the 3-dimensional structure of the protein and the fine specificity of the antibody reactivity, particularly those antibodies that inhibit invasion. This work has identified modified proteins that are more effective than the natural protein at inducing protective antibodies by immunisation, suggesting that they are particularly suitable for development into a malaria vaccine. Most recently we have shown the importance of the Fc region of the antibodies. Other polypeptides in the complex that are not derived from MSP1 are being characterised. One of them (MSP7) is tightly associated with MSP1 and we have examined its biosynthesis and maturation. In the apical organelles called rhoptries and micronemes, several sets of proteins have been investigated, using both human malaria and rodent malaria parasites. These proteins are ligands for receptor(s) on the surface of the host erythrocyte and are therefore directly involved in erythrocyte recognition and invasion. Another set of proteins is a quaternary complex of three large polypeptides. This rhoptry protein complex may also bind to red cells and could be involved after invasion in remodelling the red blood cell for the parasite to develop within. Recently we have shown that the expression of several of the genes coding for these proteins is under epigenetic control. Understanding the structure and function of these proteins may provide new targets to combat the malaria parasite. An unusual actomyosin motor located beneath the surface of the invasive form of the parasite drives it into the red cell. In collaboration with Justin Molloy and Claudia Veigel (Division of Physical Biochemistry) we are characterising the structure and function of this motor. We have already identified unusual features of the actin and shown that the motor is anchored in an inner membrane complex by a group of proteins of which one is acylated. We have identified inhibitors of one form of acylation. Inhibiting the function of the motor prevents invasion and therefore may be another point of attack using drugs to kill the parasite. The methods used include: analysis of parasite growth in vitro; analysis of protein biosynthetic pathways and function; application of expression systems to produce correct folded recombinant proteins for structural studies and to produce antibody reagents; immunochemical analysis of proteins; development of modified proteins as vaccine candidates; analysis of parasite genes and genome by cloning, sequence analysis and bioinformatic approaches.

We employ genetic and epigenetic tools to explore critical pathways that underpin or modulate nutritionally-mediated health and disease outcomes. The key driver of the Nutritional Genetics theme within the ING is the need to provide mechanistic insights into the underlying processes. The Keneba Biobank, a repository of biological samples involving the whole of the rural population of West Kiang (N~12000), presents a resource and major platform for our genetic research. Due to its tight integration across the other ING areas of research, Nutritional Genetics is a cross-cutting theme; we concentrate on the following two sub-themes: 1) Genetics and epigenetics of growth and development. Over several decades our group has collected DNA, birth size and child growth records on individuals living in rural Gambia. This is being used to understand which genes affect growth trajectories employing multi-generational, cross-sectional and longitudinal study designs in combination with high-throughput genome-wide association study (GWAS) and ExomeSNPChip genotyping arrays. Our epigenetics studies test the hypothesis that differences in maternal nutritional status during the periconceptional period influences the establishment of epigenetic signatures in the next generation. Our results on pre-natal supplementation and seasonal differences in dietary intakes demonstrate that maternal nutritional status during early pregnancy causes persistent and systemic DNA methylation changes in their offspring postnatally. 2) Genetics of nutrition-mediated infection. Our past and ongoing research demonstrated that viral, bacterial and host genetic factors modulate iron homeostasis and hence the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. Our future work focuses on seeking to identify genetic variants that affect phenotype variations of iron absorption and metabolism in Gambians. Risk alleles associated with iron deficiency and anemia will be ascertained in a first stage and in a second stage their potential functional effects on phenotypic outcomes including infection will be evaluated.

The Unit is particularly interested in how the erythroid (red cell) and megakaryocytic (platelet) lineages are specified during embryonic, fetal and adult life. The approach is currently based on the premise that lineage commitment and differentiation during development is a reflection of the cell‘s transcriptional programme. In addition we are studying the genetic and epigenetic (methylation, chromatin modification, replication, nuclear position) mechanisms by which individual key genes (e.g. globin, GATA-1, GATA-2, SCL, RUNX1) are regulated during haemopoiesis. Finally, we are studying how these processes are perturbed in inherited and acquired human genetic diseases (e.g. thalassaemia, myelodysplasia and leukaemia).

In future we plan to use such approaches to analyse how genes are regulated during haematopoiesis and particularly in erythropoiesis. Valuable as this ‘big picture’ is, it is critical that the generalities it produces are assessed for their accuracy by examination of individual loci whose detailed structure and many natural variants have been determined, and whose function can be verified by experimental manipulation. The ? globin locus and the surrounding region is one of the best characterised segments of the genome (in mouse and human) and therefore is ideal for testing predictions from the genome-wide studies. Equally, we will continue to test predictions made about nuclear processes from detailed analysis of this region by genome-wide studies. The ultimate goal of this work is to develop new ways to modify gene expression during erythropoiesis with the aim of manipulating globin gene expression and ameliorating the clinical phenotypes of patients with thalassaemia.

8	Professor Adrian Thrasher	University College London	None	None	2022-03-31	UCOE-based lentiviral vectors for effective and safe gene therapy	Retroviral vectors have become a promising tool for treatment of life threatening inherited diseases as exemplified by successful clinical applications targeting haematopoietic stem cells (HSC). However, two major problems are limiting their further clinical application namely (i) the significant risk of insertional mutagenesis as evidenced by four patients with SCID-X1 treated with anMLV-based vector developing clonal T-cell lymphoproliferation and (ii) susceptibility to epigenetic-mediated reduction and variegation in expression. There is a major need for vectors incorporating enhancer-less regulatory elements with markedly reduced insertional mutagenesis potential that are capable of giving rise to reproducible and stable transgene expression irrespective of tissue type or site of integration. This proposal aims to address this urgent requirement by exploiting the recently described ubiquitously-acting chromatin opening element (UCOE). UCOEs consist of methylation-free CpG islands encompassing dual, divergently transcribed promoters of housekeeping genes and confer resistance to transcriptional silencing and produce consistent and stable transgene expression. We have recently shown that the UCOE from the CBX3-HNRPA2B1 locus (A2UCOE) drives reproducible, stable and therapeutically relevant levels of transgene expression from within lentiviral vectors (LVs), in HSC in mice in vivo. Furthermore, this is achieved in the absence of classical enhancer activity and may confer a high safety profile. We now seek further funding to complete our pre-clinical evaluation of the efficacy and safety of A2UCOE-LVs. We propose two complementary parallel strands of investigation: (1) comprehensive in vitro and in vivo molecular and cell biology analyses to assess the insertional mutagenesis potential of the A2UCOE and (2) to assess novel A2UCOE-driven transcription unit designs for improved safety and increased efficiency, efficacy and range of application.

Research proposals: The programme will address the developmental origins of osteoporotic fracture from molecule to population, using observational as well as interventional studies. Follow-up of participants in the Hertfordshire and Helsinki cohort studies will determine the growth trajectories of individuals at later risk of fracture, and explore the impact of these trajectories on bone size, geometry, mineral content, and volumetric density; the genetic contribution to these aspects of fracture risk will be studied through genome-wide screening as part of large international consortia. Further follow-up of children included in the Southampton Womens Survey will elucidate the parental influences on skeletal development during peri-conception, pregnancy and early postnatal life. Follow-up of these children through ages 6 and 8 years will extend our understanding of the relationship between maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D status during pregnancy and childhood skeletal size, geometry and volumetric density. Our studies will permit exploration of interactions between prenatal and postnatal environmental influences such as physical activity (assessed using accelerometry), and diet (using questionnaires and biomarkers). Epigenetic mechanisms underlying the observed relationships between early environment and later bone health will be explored using samples of umbilical cord and placenta obtained from deliveries within SWS; DNA methylation status of key genes engaged in calcium transport, and maternal stress, will be related to childhood bone mass. A centrepiece of the programme will be the first randomised controlled trial to investigate whether supplementation of vitamin D during pregnancy serves to optimise skeletal development in the offspring (MAVIDOS). This aetiological trial will encompass sub-studies addressing intermediary outcome measures and the impact of vitamin D supplementation on other systems (body composition, immune function and respiratory development). Interventions to prevent osteoporotic fracture later in the lifecourse will be evaluated as part of the programme. Thus, in the MRC SCOOP trial, we test a novel methodology for risk stratification developed by the WHO in a large (n=11,500), pragmatic, randomised controlled trial. Finally, linkage with the NIHR Biomedical Research Unit in Musculoskeletal Science, University of Oxford, will permit development of a research theme addressing the lifecourse epidemiology of osteoarthritis; we shall study determinants of initiation and progression of this disorder, risk factors for arthroplasty failure, and the role of vitamin D in retarding the progression of OA. Impact: Musculoskeletal disorders have enormous health and economic impacts on society. Our research programme will permit the development of novel public health strategies to improve skeletal health throughout the lifecourse, and reduce osteoporotic fractures in future generations. Greater understanding of the epidemiology of osteoarthritis (the commonest joint disorder worldwide) will contribute to parallel strategies that reduce the incidence and morbidity associated with this disorder.

When early life undernutrition is followed by rapid childhood and adolescent weight gain or excessive adult weight gain, features that are enabled by economic transition and urbanisation, there is a high risk of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and CVD. In women, this transition increases the risk of gestational diabetes, which also causes insulin resistance and diabetes in the next generation. Poor diet quality, leading to inadequate intakes of a range of vitamins and minerals, is common among poor rural and urban women, and is associated with lower birthweight. Vitamin B12 deficiency is common in India for cultural reasons, and may be a particularly important nutritional deficit in this population. Maternal vitamin B12 deficiency is associated with low birthweight, insulin resistance in the children, and increased maternal adiposity and gestational diabetes. A major focus of our future work will be on intervention studies. Of several possible intervention points in the dual cycle of risk, we have chosen the adolescent and young adult age group, with the objective of improving the health of young women before pregnancy, improving pregnancy outcomes and reducing metabolic/CVD risk in the children. Interventions will be designed not only for overtly undernourished women, but also for middle class urban women because they too, and their children, are at risk. Alongside these intervention studies, we will continue to follow-up our existing birth cohorts, to better define associations between early life factors and risk markers for later disease, disease endpoints (CVD and T2DM), bone health and cognition. In the Delhi study, we will explore inter-generational associations for these outcomes, by studying children of the cohort. Like the other ERC programmes, we will utilise the intervention and cohort studies to explore epigenetic mechanisms as a possible link between early nutrition and later outcomes. Other international collaborations will include studies of social factors in early life in relation to adult health and disease, and studies of the economic impact of impaired early development.

Current strategies for preventing the disease rely mainly on altering adult lifestyles. Recent research suggests that factors acting during early development, including fetal growth restriction, and exposure to gestational diabetes (GDM) in the mother, increase diabetes and obesity risk in later life. Our research in India has shown that maternal vitamin B12 deficiency and hyper-homocysteinaemia, in combination with normal/high folate status, is associated with an increased risk of GDM in the mother, growth restriction in her fetus, and adiposity and insulin resistance in her children. These effects could act through epigenetic mechanisms and occur in paternal as well as maternal B12 deficiency. Improving the B12 status of women and men preparing for pregnancy could be a scalable and affordable intervention to prevent diabetes in future generations. Our proposed programme includes an RCT of B12 supplementation in rural Indian adolescents who will marry and conceive within the next 4 years, aiming to improve newborn B12 status and body composition and reduce diabetes risk in their children. We will also carry out 2 observational studies in the UK, to replicate the earlier Indian findings and study their wider relevance. We will measure B12, folate and homocysteine in stored maternal samples from a UK birth cohort which has measured body composition in the children, and carry out a case-control study of mothers with and without GDM in a UK population at high risk and with a high S Asian population (W Midlands) to determine whether UK women who develop GDM have low B12 status, or B12/folate imbalance, in early pregnancy. Samples taken in all studies will be used for genetic studies, and future epigenetic research, relevant to our objectives.

Samples taken in all studies will be used for genetic studies, and future epigenetic research, relevant to our objectives. We expect this unique research to have a major impact on future strategies to prevent type 2 diabetes.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	938276.0	GBP
17	Professor Richard Festenstein	MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences	None	2005-04-01	2012-03-31	Gene Control Mechanisms and Disease	Our research is aimed at unravelling the molecular mechanisms underlying epigenetic memory in mammals whereby cells establish and maintain gene expression patterns, and at understanding how dysregulation at this level leads to human diseases. Such research is crucial for the development of novel treatments for several diseases by modulating chromatin structure and for the development of reliable gene therapy protocols as well as understanding the plasticity of stem cells. The research builds on our finding that a gene-regulatory element known as a locus control region (LCR) can overcome gene silencing mediated by proximity to highly repetitive heterochromatic genomic regions. We have shown that in the absence of the LCR such silencing strongly resembles the archetypal epigenetic phenomenon of position effect variegation (PEV), hitherto demonstrated in Drosophila and yeast. By studying modifiers of PEV in an in vivo mammalian system we have shown that aberrant silencing associated with several triplet-repeat diseases occurs at the level of heterochromatin and can be reversed in vivo; such silencing can not only be reversed by an LCR but can also be overcome by drugs known to modify chromatin structure. Recently we have uncovered important differences in the extent of heterochromatin silencing in male and female mice which is not determined by the gender of the mice but rather the number of X chromosomes - this finding has implications for understanding sexual dimorphism, a feature of many diseases, which is usually attributed to the male or female phenotypes. Our work currently focuses on the interplay between nuclear organisation, chromatin structure and epigenetic modifiers in establishing and maintaining the differentiated state of the cell. Our recent finding that a key component of the densely packaged form of DNA known as heterochromatin is in a continuous state of flux has shattered the previously held view that heterochromatin acted as a molecular glue. Our finding opens up the possibility of re-programming the genome even in so-called inaccessible heterochromatin regions. We are currently investigating the reversibility of such silencing in the neurological disease Friedreichs ataxia; this promises to provide a radical approach for treating this currently incurable condition.

We aim to: (1) maximise the potential of the ERC cohorts to enable the definition of developmental influences on major childhood and adult disorders, and examine hypotheses relating to prenatal/postnatal mismatch, epigenetic processes and economic consequences; and (2) conduct intervention studies in young women to improve their health and that of their children. Research proposals: Within the SWS and our other mother-offspring cohorts we shall examine the hypothesis that maternal and lifestyle influences from before conception, and mismatches between the fetal/infant and later childhood environment, have detrimental effects on body composition, cardiovascular structure and function, respiratory disease and atopy, and cognition. Data from Helsinki and from other European cohorts will be used to increase our understanding of influences on major adult disorders, notably cardiovascular disease and cancer. Within our EpiGen consortium we aim to define epigenetic biomarkers of later disease risk that will inform intervention studies. Our data resources spanning the lifecourse provide opportunities for comprehensive mechanistic and behavioural insights into chronic diseases and markers at different stages of life. Moreover, in an international collaboration we are defining the economic consequences of a poor start to life, which will inform public health policy and assess the potential impact of focused interventions. Finally, our work has led to four interventions to improve the diets and health behaviours of young women. Three of these target women in pregnancy. The fourth focuses on women of child-bearing age who already have young children. The aim is to improve the health of the women prior to any subsequent pregnancy and that of their children. Impact: Our work contributes to three current MRC research priorities: clinical and public health research, ageing-related research, and biomarkers. The work has a strong clinical and public health focus, our lifecourse approach increases understanding of ageing, and our work on epigenetic processes aims to identify biomarkers that assist in the characterisation of new interventions to improve public health. Our cohort studies will provide evidence as to whether mismatches between the maternal, infant and childhood environments are associated with cardiovascular risk, impaired respiratory health, cognitive development, and obesity. Our intervention studies will provide translational data on the benefits of better nutrition of young women, and have the potential to improve the health of women and children now, and that of future generations.

It is an important process during animal early development for setting up and maintaining stable patterns of gene transcription in adult tissues. In essence it describes how modification of chromatin or DNA regulates a genes activity.||Our main interest is determining the interplay between chromatin and DNA based silencing mechanisms in maintaining gene silencing during early animal development? We have made some exciting discoveries establishing the importance of epigenetic regulators in determining the onset of transcription during early development in amphibians, and how mis-regulation of these processes may lead to apoptosis and subsequent alterations in cellular identity and development.||The maintenance cytosine methyltransferase, xDnmt1, is responsible for maintaining high levels of DNA methylation in development. We have shown that it also acts as a direct transcription repressor protein, independently of its catalytic function, in early embryos. In addition we have identified a potential pathway though which loss of xDnmt1 function results in direct activation of a cell death pathway.||We believe our findings have important implications for the molecular basis of diverse human diseases in which epigenetic regulation is altered and potentially an understanding of the nature of cellular potency (stem cells). Our work may also contribute to the development of safe health care applications such as small molecule inhibitors of Dnmt1 function.	Medical Research Council	Unit	None	None

The evidence points to variations in maternal diet (and hence a mother’s methyl donor metabolome) as being responsible; when methyl donor supply is poor, resulting in a displacement of the intermediary pathways driving methylation (especially the SAM/SAH ratio), there is a higher frequency of offspring showing loss of imprinting. This project has 3 key aims: Aim 1: Extend our analysis of VTRNA2-1 methylation to include 700+ additional mother/infant pairs to better characterise the periods of critical exposure. This will help to refine our insights into the maternal nutritional exposures responsible for loss of imprinting. We will extend our analysis of the maternal methyl donor metabolome to an additional 350 mothers and an extended panel of nutrients and intermediary markers. We will then work with in silico modellers to establish which are the critical drivers of methylation variation; Aim 2: Examine the implications of imprinting or loss of imprinting at VTRNA2-1 on gene expression and cellular function using a recall-by-epigenotype methodology; Aim 3: To design a nutriceutical intervention to prevent disrupted DNA methylation. This aim will be based on insights gained from Aim 1 and will perform small scale preliminary interventions in small groups of non-pregnant women in preparation for anticipated large scale trials.

The full impact of vaccination against high-risk human papillomavirus (HRHPV) will not be seen for ~30 years and there will be no benefits for women who are already HRHPV positive. We will investigate key events in the development of cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) following HRHPV infection. We will study mechanisms of viral persistence, causes of deregulated viral transcription in proliferating (basal) epithelium and the significance of common host genomic changes induced by over-expressed HRHPV oncogenes. Aims/Objectives: (i) Test the value of oncostatin M receptor (OSMR) as a therapeutic target in cervical SCC. OSMR is one of the most frequently over-expressed genes in cervical SCC and predicts adverse overall survival, independent of disease stage. As a cell surface molecule, OSMR is a strong candidate for antibody-mediated inhibition, a strategy that has had a major impact on HER2-positive breast cancers. (ii) Discover genes on chromosome 3 that mediate the transition from cervical pre-cancer to malignancy. (iii) Identify viral genetic and/or epigenetic changes that determine high levels of HRHPV transcription in basal cervical epithelium. (iv) Define the contribution of host genes to cell selection in the early stages of neoplastic progression associated with integrated HRHPV. We will definitively test whether HRHPV deregulates host genes at or near the integration site (i.e. insertional mutagenesis). (v) Test whether the contribution of steroid hormones to cervical carcinogenesis depends on HRHPV physical state (episomal vs. integrated) and/or epigenetic modifications to viral chromatin. (vi) Study the significance of down-regulated anti-viral receptors TLR3 and RIG-I in HRHPV persistence. We recently found that both molecules are under-expressed in persistent HPV16 infection, due to an effect of one or more viral gene product(s). Methods: We will use archival clinical specimens, plus the unique W12 system, which accurately models key viral and host events in cervical carcinogenesis. Major resources will be a panel of 24 isogenic W12 clones, each with HPV16 integrated at a different genomic site, plus a long-term W12 culture series in which in vitro carcinogenesis is associated with transcriptional deregulation of viral episomes not integrants. Use of Research: The work will address important clinical needs, including: improved identification of progressive cervical pre-cancers and early-stage SCCs; greater understanding of the effects and risks of anti-HRHPV therapies currently in use or development; and generation of new therapeutic strategies that target viral oncogenes or significant host factors.

This Cooperative Grouping was established in 1999 with the aim of fostering interaction between experimental and clinical studies on genomic imprinting. The key objectives of identifying new imprinted genes, establishing detailed analyses of physiological and developmental pathways of their action in fetal growth, and of identifying imprinting gene defects in the human population, were all achieved. This has put the Cooperative in an excellent position to increase the number of PIs in complementary areas evolving from the existing studies and to tackle a new set of objectives. These are: (1) the application of critical analysis into growth control from mouse knockout models to normal and aberrant human intrauterine growth, (2) to explore the action of imprinted signalling pathways in adaptations to early postnatal life, (3) to explore the action of imprinted genes in brain and behaviour and (4) to investigate epigenetic mechanisms of imprinted gene expression associated with growth, developmental and behavioural phenotypes. The new name of the Cooperative, ?Imprinting in Health and Disease? reflects its wider remit while it remains committed to a multidisciplinary approach linking experimental with clinical studies.

23	Professor Anne Ferguson-Smith	University of Cambridge	Genetics	2012-05-15	2018-02-28	Genomic imprinting and the epigenetic control of developmental processes	Genomic imprinting is an epigenetically regulated process causing genes to be expressed according to their parental origin. Genetics studies have shown that genomic imprinting occurs at dosage-sensitive genes and regulates important developmental processes during the lifetime of the mammal. In human, altered imprinted gene expression is associated with growth, metabolic and neurological disorders, and cancer. Imprinting is regulated by DNA methylation, an epigenetic modification that differentially marks the two parental chromosomes influencing long range cis-acting control of the activity and repression of protein-coding and small and large regulatory non-coding RNAs. Over the past 20 years, genomic imprinting has emerged as a useful paradigm contributing to our understanding of the roles of epigenetic modifications in the regulation of gene activity and repression, and into wider mechanisms underlying the epigenetic control of genome function in development, health and disease. Recently we have shown in a developmental model of postnatal neurogenesis, selective absence of imprinting occurs to control gene dosage in the stem cell niche and this is required to maintain the postnatal stem cell pool and the synthesis of new neurons. This suggests that dosage control by imprinting may be an epigenetically modulatable process that can adapt to particular environmental requirements during development. Understanding epigenetic modulation in response to environmental signals is a major challenge in biomedical research. The proposed research aims to focus on mechanisms and developmental pathways associated with this. Addressing these aims has timely general implications for understanding the epigenetic regulation of the stem cell niche and for the characterization of factors and pathways that influence the relationship between stem cells and their environment contributing to our understanding of adult onset diseases, neuronal plasticity, aging and cancer.

Experiments will be carried out to determine the relationship on this activity with the centromere-specific CENP-A chromatin and to establish whether topo II is involved in imprinting the site of kinetochore assembly. Like many eukaryotes vertebrates have two forms of this enzyme, alpha and beta, encoded by independent genes. RNAi will be used to determine the relative contribution of two isoforms to the centromeric cleavage footprint. Finally we will examine whether topo II plays a role at the centromete in two other eukaryotes for which molecularly well defined minichromosomes/centromeres are available - Drosophila and Schizosaccharomyces pombe.

26	Prof Wolf Reik	Babraham Institute	None	None	None	MRC Capacity Building Studentship: Role of cytidine deaminases and base excision repair in epigenetic reprogramming	Genetic information is passed from generation to generation and is the material upon which natural selection acts. On top of this genetic information the genome also contains epigenetic information in the form of chemical and other modifications to DNA, which are associated with gene expression and genome function. Epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation are of key importance in development, stem cell biology and regenerative medicine, and cancer. During certain periods of early development of an embryo, epigenetic modifications including DNA methylation are reprogrammed on a genome wide level. This may be important in order to establish totipotency (the ability to give rise to an entire organism) of the embryonic genome. The mechanisms of the removal of DNA methylation from the genome are unknown in mammals. This student project investigates a class of candidate enzymes in the mouse which have been shown to be able to chemically alter methylated cytosines. There are four of these candidate genes in the mouse genome, for three of which we have knockout mutations (to create inactive genes). A fourth knockout is being constructed, and knockouts will then be examined for altered DNA methylation, development, and possible effects on cancer risk.

27	Prof Wolf Reik	Babraham Institute	Developmental Genetics and Imprinting	2009-01-01	2011-12-31	An in vitro compartmentalisation screen for mammalian DNA demethylases	Genome wide epigenetic reprogramming occurs in germ cells and early embryos in mammalian development. Such reprogramming is important for immortality of the germ cell lineage, genomic imprinting, the erasure of epimutations, the transmission of pluripotency, and early lineage commitment events. Experimental reprogramming through iPS cells also requires epigenetic reprogramming, and this is often inefficient or incomplete, thus limiting the potential clinical applications of this promising techniques. A cardinal mechanism of reprogramming is demethylation of 5-methylcytosine in DNA by active and passive mechanisms. Despite efforts to identify active demethylases in mammals there is no confirmed enzyme that can either directly or indirectly (involving DNA repair) demethylate DNA. The identification of demethylases in mammals would be a critical advance in our progress in understanding reprogramming and in harnessing this mechanism for regenerative medicine, especially for the efficient generation of iPS cells. We have devised, constructed and validated a universal screen for demethylases which is based on an in vitro compartmentalisation assay. This assay links, in emulsion droplets, clones from cDNA expression libraries to a methylated DNA sequence; upon expression of a demethylase in a droplet this sequence becomes demethylated and renders this particular cDNA clone amplifiable by PCR. We have validated the screen and found it to be exquisitely sensitive and selective for demethylated molecules. Biochemical reaction conditions can be adjusted at will by using different extracts for the emulsions, and can be adapted to direct or repair mediated demethylation. Any number of cDNA libraries can be screened quickly and effectively. Candidate clones isolated from screens will be tested in our established mammalian cell and animal systems, including the iPS system, in order to reveal demethylase and reprogramming functions in vivo.

Somatic cells (any cell in the body other than an egg or sperm) might be taken directly from patients, and their nuclei reprogrammed to a stem cell (that can give rise to most tissues) state by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) into oocytes. This scenario is difficult, however, because of inefficient epigenetic reprogramming during SCNT, and because of ethical difficulties with obtaining oocytes for this purpose. It is therefore important to begin to identify reprogramming factors that is molecules or enzymes that are able to revert epigenetic modifications in somatic cells to those in stem cells. Epigenetic modifications occur in the form of chemical and other modifications to DNA, which are associated with gene expression and genome function.

A number of exciting technologies have recently been developed by which the derivation of embryonic stem (ES) cells from adult cell types is now possible. This includes the transfer of reprogramming factors into adult cells, resulting in the generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Inducing `pluripotency is of direct relevance to regenerative medicine as it enables specific cell populations and tissues to be generated from/for patients. However, this technology is inefficient and a particular bottleneck appears to be the reprogramming of the epigenome. Epigenetics or the epigenome refers to all the modifications to DNA and chromatin that are important for the function of the genome in the context of development and in the adult organism in different organs and tissues. Importantly, in germ cells (that develop into eggs or sperm) and early embryos, the epigenome is reprogrammed on a genome- wide scale, so that development of a new organism and new stem cells is possible. Work in our laboratory and others has revealed several features of this genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming. In collaboration with the company CellCentric, we have begun to set up a number of systematic screens for the isolation of epigenetic reprogramming factors. The current programme of work with CellCentric aims to assess the function of these new reprogramming factors in germ cells and early embryos, ES cells, and in the generation of iPS cells. CellCentric will in particular work on the isolation of small molecules that can alter the function of our reprogramming factors, which will then be tested in ES and iPS cells. The combined programme of work will shed new light on the fundamental process of epigenetic reprogramming, and provide new tools for the manipulation of stem cells and the translation into approaches to regenerative medicine and healthy ageing.

Abberant imprints are the cause of a number of human growth and neurodevelopmental syndromes and are a frequent occurrence in cancer. Despite this, functional assessment of the role of the maintenance methyltransferase in regulating imprints in humans has been lacking. By using stably integrated small hairpin RNA targeting the DNMT1 gene in hTERT-immortalised cells we appear to have generated the first normal human cell lines lacking imprinting at both paternally and maternally methylated ICR due to targeted loss of methylation. These provide a unique resource for examining the effects of loss of maintenance methylation on imprinted genes. We aim to characterise these cells more fully using genome-wide assays of DNA methylation and gene expression, a bank of targeted pyrosequencing assays designed specifically to interrogate the imprinted loci and the use of chromatin immunoprecipitation. This should greatly inform the clinical and research community as to the effects of loss of maintenance methylation in normal cells and help to establish if imprinted disorders are primarily caused by chromatin or DNA methylation changes. Additionally, we will use these cells to benchmark 5'-aza-2'-deoxcytidine (Aza) treatment with the effects of DNMT1 depletion in a normal cell line, of direct clinical relevance for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and potentially for other disorders. Further hypomorphic cell lines will be created to determine if cells from different tissues share a common response to loss of maintenance methylation: we will also attempt to re-establish methylation at an imprinted locus in these and other imprint-free cells by rescue experiments. Finally, the experiments may identity novel imprinted regions in humans.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	378636.0	GBP

We have previously shown that alterations in chromatin precede the onset of gene expression and also the stable formation of transcription factor complexes. We hypothesized that transcription factors transiently bind to their recognition sequences and leave a remodelled chromatin structure behind. In the work described here we wish to use an in vitro differentiation system based on mouse ES cells to gain insights into the earliest events of epigenetic priming of individual genes. We will initially concentrate on two genes, Pu.1 and csf1r which are part of a transcriptional hierarchy. We aim to identify the earliest factors binding to these genes. We will also manipulate the levels of a transcription factor known to regulate the timing of onset of expression of both genes (Runx1) and directly measure the effect of such manipulation on Pu.1 and csf1r chromatin structure. In addition, we plan to use a novel technique (DamId-fusion proteins) to map short-lived interactions of Runx1 with its target genes and correlate this with alterations in chromatin. Last, but not least, we plan to use this technique to identify new target genes for Runx1 and another important transcription factor, Smad1. These target loci themselves will be subject to further mechanistic studies in the future. We regard this joint proposal as a powerful alliance between two laboratories with highly relevant complementary expertise. Our combined expertise of ES cell engineering, sophisticated ES cell culture and chromatin fine structure analyses techniques provides us with a unique opportunity to probe deep into the molecular details of how haemopoietic development is initiated.

The research will employ the following methodologies in order to meet the stated aims and objectives in the "Case for Support". 1. Human primary liver myobroblasts. These cells will be used to determine mechanisms by which epigenetic and transcription pathways influence fibrogenesis. The cells will be isolated from the normal margins of liver tissue resected for the removal of secondary tumours provided by liver surgeons (Profs White and Mannas) at the Newcastle NHS Trust Freeman Hospital. Isolated cells will be purified by density centrifugation and cultured in serum-containing media. 2. A human myofibroblast cell line, LX2, will be used where high numbers of myofibroblasts are required for detailed studies such as chromatin immunoprecipitation, or where there is a need to modulate the expression of genes under study by transfection-based approaches. The LX2 line was generated in the laboratory of Prof Scott Friedman and is highly representative of the fibrogenic phenotype of primary liver myofibroblasts. 3. Archived paraffin-embedded diseased human liver tissue will be used for immunohistochemical detection of key regulatory proteins identified during the research as important to validate in human diseased tissue. The tissue is managed by the Newcastle University and NHS Trust Biobank and will be supplied as anonymised liver slide sections, with the original tissue blocks being retained by the Biobank. 4. Genetically modified mice (C57/Bl6) for key fibrogenic regulators such as MeCP2 and JunD will be used for supply of myofibroblasts in which these genes are either deleted or mutated into functionally attenuated forms, these studies enabling gene function to be examined with a high degree of confidence.

Greater understanding how the immune system controls chronic infection will directly impact upon and translate into improved understanding of immunotherapy therapy and vaccine regimens. CMV is however an important cause of mortality and morbidity both within the UK and across the world. Although infection is well tolerated by immune competent people it is a major problem in patients who are immunosuppressed. Additionally, CMV is the major global infectious cause of congenital abnormalities. In addition, CMV has emerged as an important risk factor for health problems in the elderly and those with inflammatory disease due in part to a marked increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease (CVD). The work will take advantage of several MRC supported, large and richly phenotyped population cohorts Healthy Donors: >100 regular healthy donors aged 18-70 years; 1000+ donors aged 65-90+ years in the 'Thousand Elders' Cohort and a 5 year prospective study of 1000 medical students.

The aim is to improve the efficiency of nuclear reprogramming and hence new cell type generation by interfering with the epigenetic mechanisms stabilizing the differentiated state of a cell. We propose to investigate the epigenetic basis of cellular memory using nuclear transfer (NT) to amphibian eggs. First, we will address the extent of cellular memory in NT embryos using donor nuclei from different cell types and differentiation status. We will identify by RNAseq the genes showing donor cell type specific memory of gene expression and then ask if this memory increases with the differentiation status of the donor cell. Since cellular memory genes resist the reprograming process and remain expressed in the wrong cell type of NT-embryos, we propose that memory genes are associated with certain epigenetic modifications that cannot be efficiently removed by the egg and hence act as a barrier to efficient reprogramming. To identify these modifications, we will next investigate the genomic distribution of candidate epigenetic marks in the donor cells at different stages of embryonic development via ChIPseq and determine how they localise with regard to memory genes. Lastly, after identifying the epigenetic features correlating with memory genes, we will ask which of those features impose a barrier to successful reprogramming. This will be done by transplanting nuclei with modified chromatin to enucleated eggs. We will look for the improved generation of new cell-types and tissues in the resulting embryos by analyzing their gene expression patterns. Furthermore, we will score the developmental outcome of NT embryos. We expect to identify chromosomal components that can be removed for efficient reprogramming and cell-type generation, and hence improve the prospect of successful cell replacement therapies.

Importantly, pro-inflammatory CD4+ T-cells can also produce the potent anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10), thereby limiting excessive tissue damage. Detailed understanding how IL-10 is regulated is therefore scientifically and clinically important. We recently demonstrated that tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-blocking drugs, which are widely used in treatment of RA, promote IL-10 expression in human CD4+ T-cells. Our overarching aim is to determine the molecular mechanisms via which TNF blockade regulates the expression of IL-10 in human pro-inflammatory CD4+ T-cells and to determine what the functional consequences are. Our data indicate an important role for the transcription factor IKZF3 (encoding Aiolos) in regulating IL-10 in human CD4+ T-cells. Using molecular, genetic, epigenetic, bioinformatic and cellular approaches we will (1) define how TNF signaling vs. blockade influences IKZF3-mediated regulation of IL-10 in human pro-inflammatory CD4+ T-cells; (2) investigate how TNF blockade modifies the epigenetic landscape of pro-inflammatory CD4+ T-cells; (3) determine the function and stability of TNF-blockade-induced IL-10 expressing CD4+ T-cells. Collectively, this program could reveal new molecular mechanisms of TNF blockade, indicate novel targets for immunotherapy, and suggest possible biomarkers of responsiveness.

39	Professor Adrian Whitehouse	University of Leeds	None	2015-09-01	2018-08-31	Viral control of the m6A methylome	m6A methylation is a common base modification present in eukaryotic mRNA. However, its biological significance is still poorly understood. Recent technological advances have shown that m6A methylation occurs in >7000 transcripts and has also led to the identification of enzymes which make this RNA modification dynamic and reversible. As such, reversible m6A methylation may have critical roles in gene regulation analogous to dynamically regulated DNA and protein modifications. Thus, dynamically reversible RNA modifications, such as m6A methylation, represent an emerging layer of gene regulation at the RNA level, termed RNA epigenetics or epitranscriptomics. We have exciting preliminary data to suggest Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) manipulates pathways which regulate m6A methylation. As such, this provides an excellent model to study the fundamental regulatory aspects of m6A methylation at an RNA epigenetic level. Our preliminary data shows that the KSHV ORF57 protein redistributes the recently identified RNA m6A demethylase, human fat mass and obesity (FTO)-associated protein, from nuclear speckles into the nucleolus. Moreover, this redistribution results in alterations within the m6A methylation status of viral and cellular mRNAs. Specifically, FTO redistribution dramatically reverses viral mRNA m6A methylation while increasing cellular mRNA m6A methylation status. The aim of this project is to determine what implications virus-mediated FTO redistribution and manipulation of the m6A methylation pathway has upon cellular and viral m6A methylomes. We will examine what effect altering the m6A methylation status has upon the fate and function of viral and cellular mRNAs. In addition, we will test the requirement of FTO redistribution and alterations in the m6A methylome for virus replication and assess the therapeutic potential of inhibiting this virus-based manipulation of the m6A methylation pathway as a novel antiviral strategy.

We recently identified the first two animal microRNAs with 100 per cent complementarity to an endogenous murine gene. This putative target mRNA is a retrotransposon- like gene (Rtl1) that is subject to genomic imprinting and located within a 1 Mb imprinted domain on distal mouse chromosome 12. Here we propose to determine the potential link between endogenous miRNAs, retrotransposon silencing and genomic imprinting by characterising the functional link between the miRNAs and Rtl1, and determining potential epigenetic consequences of such an interaction.

The role of imprinted genes in pre-natal growth control has been apparent since their discovery, however more recently a role for imprinted genes in metabolic processes has emerged. Gene subject to genomic imprinting are predominantly expressed from one of the two parental chromosomes and are epigenetically regulated by parental-origin specific differential modifications to DNA and chromatin. Hence the dosage of imprinted gene products is dependent on regional epigenetic states rendering them vulnerable and adaptable. An imprinted domain located on mouse chromosome 12 contains the gene for a developmentally regulated atypical Notch-Delta signaling molecule, Delta-like homologue 1 (Dlk1/Pref1). Dlk1 contributes to both prenatal growth and post-natal metabolism and is expressed in the pancreas and peripheral tissues regulating glucose homeostasis. Using transgenic and knockout mouse models in which levels of Dlk1/Pref1 have been either lost or doubled, we have established an experimental paradigm for the investigation of the link between epigenetic regulation, genomic imprinting, prenatal development and post-natal metabolism. Here we propose an integrated programme of research that specifically investigates the relationship between levels of Dlk1 during development and the postnatal consequences for metabolism. Extending these studies, we propose to test the hypothesis that epigenetic control at imprinted domains can be affected by a compromised in utero environment. This research aims to contribute to our understanding of the developmental origins of adult disease.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	568233.0	GBP

This epigenetic reprogramming is believed to be important for the regulation of pluripotency genes. In contrast, genomic methylation imprints, heritable methylation states acquired in the germline and required for the correct mono-allelic expression of imprinted genes after fertilisation, are resistant to epigenetic reprogramming. This resistance to reprogramming ensures that the epigenetic memory which differentially marks the maternal and paternally inherited chromosomes at imprinted loci, remains heritable in embryos. It is not understood what makes methylation imprints resistant to epigenetic reprogramming. We have recently identified a KRAB zinc-finger protein, ZFP57, that when absent from both the egg and the zygote, results in loss of methylation from germline imprints. This suggests an important role for this factor in the maintenance of genomic imprints in preimplantation embryos. Here we propose a series of experiments to: 1. Identify the extent to which imprints are regulated by ZFP57. 2. Identify genomic target sites for ZFP57. 3. Determine the relationship between the KRAB- binding co-repressor KAP1 and imprinting control. 4. Identify ZFP57 interacting partners, including DNA methyltransferases. Using these approaches we aim to test the hypothesis that ZFP57 maintains methylation by specifically targeting the DNA methyltransferase machinery to germline imprints, and to better understand the newly defined role for KRAB-zinc-finger proteins in the in vivo regulation of the mammalian epigenetic programme.

Many ncRNAs are involved in gene silencing, but the precise mechanisms of silencing and the links to human diseases are not well understood. We are working on the long, nuclear, and imprinted ncRNA Kcnq1ot1 which silences in cis a large cluster of imprinted genes amongst which are key regulators of placental function and fetal growth. Loss of imprinting of Kcnq1ot1 is a frequent cause of the fetal overgrowth and cancer syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. We have recently found that gene silencing mediated by Kcnq1ot1 shares remarkable parallels with X chromosome inactivation mediated by the ncRNA Xist. This includes the fact that the Kcnq1ot1 RNA appears to establish a physical structure in the nucleus which may be a silencing compartment, and the targeting by the ncRNA of repressive histone modifications to the cluster. We have also begun to establish a Kcnq1ot1 alelle which can be activated or silenced in mice with the Tet system, and fully quantitative conditions for 3C (chromosome conformation capture) of the locus using the Sequenom masspec system. The overall aim of this proposal is to understand how expression and physical organisation of the Kcnq1ot1 RNA together with its target locus results in epigenetic gene silencing in a large gene cluster. The specific objectives are 1.to determine in preimplantation embryos the precise epigenetic dynamics leading from Kcnq1ot1 expression and coating to gene silencing, 2. to construct in mice a tetracycline inducible Kcnq1ot1 allele and to test at which stages of development and in which lineages expression of the Kcnq1ot1 RNA can induce and maintain epigenetic gene silencing in cis, 3. to analyse higher order chromatin structure of the Kcnq1ot1 cluster by quantitative allele-specific 3C with the Sequenom system, and to determine its dependence on the ncRNA using the tetracycline regulatable Kcnq1ot1 allele and, 4. to analyse imprinted gene expression and epigenetic marks in the cluster in a conditional Dicer knockout deleted in embryonic or extraembryonic tissues, respectively. This work will establish comprehensively the physical organisation of the Kcnq1ot1 RNA ?silencing compartment? and how this, together with developmental factors, may lead to epigenetic gene silencing. This may result in novel biomarkers which we will translate to BWS patients through our established clinical collaboration. Significant new insights may also emerge into why the risk of BWS (and other epigenetic disorders) is increased by ART in humans.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	657965.0	GBP

These genes have important roles in embryonic development, growth, and human diseases including cancer. Imprinted genes occur in clusters in the genome, and some clusters are regulated by long non- coding RNAs (RNA which does not code for proteins), which somehow inactivate the genes located next to them in the cluster. This project will investigate the mechanisms by which the non-coding RNA Kcnq1ot1, deregulation of which underlies the human overgrowth and cancer syndrome Beckwith- Wiedemann syndrome, regulates gene silencing. This will include investigations of physical interactions of the RNA with the gene cluster, and the consequent change of higher order organisation of the gene cluster.

45	Prof Wolf Reik	Babraham Institute	None	2009-10-01	2013-09-30	CTR studentship: Role of the base excision repair pathway in demethylation of DNA and trophoblast development	Genetic information is passed from generation to generation and is the material upon which natural selection acts. On top of this genetic information the genome also contains epigenetic information in the form of chemical and other modifications to DNA, which are associated with gene expression and genome function. Epigenetic information is acquired during development and perhaps also dependent on changing environmental conditions. During development of germ cells (egg and sperm) and gametes however there is a process of erasure of such epigenetic information. This may aid embryonic development afresh in the next generation, and eliminate acquired epigenetic information so that it cannot be passed down the generations. The mechanisms of erasure of epigenetic information may partly be based on repair of DNA. We are addressing the mechanisms of erasure in animal models, and how perturbations in this process might affect the development of early embryos.

Understanding these processes is the shared research focus of five Wellcome Trust-funded Investigators at the Babraham Institute (Reik, Turner, Hemberger, Roychoudhuri, Houseley). These investigations are facilitated by high-throughput sequencing techniques. Such techniques require generation of sequencing libraries which is time-intensive and limited by high inter-experiment variability. Application of single-cell and low cell-number epigenetic techniques developed at the Institute at high sample numbers is also currently impossible. Such limitations could be overcome through acquisition of high-throughput automation equipment for library generation within our Next-generation sequencing (NGS) facility. In this application, we propose to acquire an automated fluid handling workstation and associated equipment to enable high-throughput automation of sequencing library preparation at the Institute. This will benefit Wellcome-funded researchers at the Institute through improved sequencing quality and reproducibility across a variety of applications including gene expression analysis, ribosomal footprinting, transcription factor binding, and epigenetic analyses from extremely low-input samples and single cells. It would also enable the sequencing of single cell-derived samples at medium to high throughput which is critical for analysis of tissues during development and immunity.

50	Professor Dickinson	University of Oxford	None	None	None	Epigenetic control of the plant male gametophyte and germline	In animals, epigenetic machinery is essential for generating and maintaining the germline and germ cells. Angiosperms lack strict germlines but after meiosis form male and female haploid cell lines (the gametophytes) which generate sperms and eggs. Male gametophyte development involves a switch to a significantly different gene expression programme. While dramatic DNA methylation and chromatin changes occur on a global scale during gametophyte formation, data are sparse and conflicting concerning the small RNA (sRNA) pathways, which are so critical to epigenetic gene regulation in the sporophyte. We will determine the contribution of sRNA pathways to development of the male gametophyte and germline of Arabidopsis thaliana by inhibiting sRNA processing systems through expression of a range of viral suppressors of eukaryotic gene silencing systems. To identify which sRNA pathways are active during gametophyte and germline development we shall use microarrays and RTPCR to monitor expression of genes encoding key elements of the small RNA processing and RNA-dependent DNA methylation pathways, at different stages of development. We will then use artificial microRNA constructs, and (ii) RNA-dependent DNA methylation and transcriptional gene silencing, using hairpin constructs directed to non-endogenous promoter constructs to confirm that the different cell types of the gametophye and germline are capable of (i) mature microRNA biogenesis and microRNA- directed cleavage and/or translational inhibition transcripts. Finally we will explore the 'totality' of the impact of sRNA systems on gametophyte and germline development by determining - for the first time - the 'sRNA transcriptome' at three key developmental stages. Established bioinformatics approaches will be used to identify (i) genomic and mRNA targets of gametophytic/germline sRNAs, and (ii) trends in sRNA expression during development.

The intervention reduced the incidence of gestational diabetes, and among women of normal or high BMI, increased birth weight. The aim of the study proposed here is to determine whether it has improved the health and capacity of the children at the age of 6 years. The study has already started (from Sept 2013) so as not to miss the age window in the earliest-born children. Ethical approval was obtained from JJ Hospital, Mumbai. Families are visited by health workers to explain the study. As close as possible to their 6th birthday, the child and both parents attend a research clinic at the Centre for the Study of Social Change in Bandra, Mumbai, after an overnight fast. Detailed body measurements of the parents and child are performed. A fasting blood sample is taken from the child for glucose, insulin and lipids, and further samples drawn at 30 and 120 minutes after an oral glucose load. Blood pressure and hand grip strength are measured. Fat, lean and bone mass are measured using DXA. Cognitive function is measured using the Kaufman Assessment Battery and other tests validated for Indian children and designed to measure multiple domains. Parents' fasting glucose is measured. DNA and RNA samples for future genetic/epigenetic analyses are collected from children and parents, and frozen. 110 children have been studied so far, and over 3 years we expect to study ~1500 (80%) of the surviving children from the original 1962 births. We will have 80% power to detect a difference of 0.14 SDs in continuous outcomes between treatment and control groups at 5% significance. This equates, for example, to approximately 1.4 mmHg of systolic blood pressure.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	398861.0	GBP

New paradigms in Vitamin B12 research There is renewed interest in the nutritional biology of vitamins B12 and folate, because of three new developments: A very high prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency has been recorded in a number of populations, notably in India but also in many countries in Latin America. These vitamins have been shown to be important in physiological and pathological processes hitherto unsuspected, including neurocognitive development, immune function, bone development and the foetal programming of body composition and insulin resistance. In addition to their well-known role in haematopoiesis, neurological function, methylation pathways and nucleic acid synthesis, there is growing recognition that they control the epigenetic regulation of genes and may have profound effects on cellular function. These exciting new developments have necessitated a meeting of people with an interest in these two vitamins, to plan an international research agenda based on current information and new directions. It is intended to discuss the following topics in a 2 day meeting: Current knowledge on the role of vitamin B12 and folate in metabolism and cellular function. The global prevalence and causes of vitamin B12 deficiency. The role of vitamin B12 and folate during pregnancy and lactation in developmental programming. Epigenetic and genetic processes, and immune and inflammatory mechanisms as pathways by which vitamin B12 deficiency causes disease. Rational supplementation policies and novel nutritional sources. The main objectives of the meeting are to develop research collaborations within India and internationally, to develop a framework and strategy for research required in this area, and to plan the preparation of research proposals and the carrying out of studies.

55	Professor Richard Festenstein	Imperial College London	Unlisted	2005-03-01	2010-03-31	Deciphering the epigenetic code	Histone tails protruding from the nucleosome are modified at selected amino acids, by e.g. lysine acetylation, lysine and arginine methylation, serine phosphorylation and attachment of ubiquitin, generating an epigenetic code thought to be essential for cells to establish and ?remember? specific programmes of gene expression during cellular differentiation. Recently new insights have been gained into how single histone modifications affect chromatin function. However, to fully decipher the information capacity of histone tails, a better understanding is essential of how specific combinations of tail modifications are generated and how the modification of one residue can affect that of another. The main tools presently used to study the epigenetic code are antibodies against specific histone modifications. Unfortunately, such approaches miss the potential effect of various combinations of histone modifications. Furthermore, it has been proven to be extremely difficult to generate antisera even to single histone modifications with a high enough selectivity, to distinguish between similar modifications on different residues or different modifications on the same residue, for example di-versus trimethylated histones. It is now apparent that the application of high-resolution mass spectometry approaches should allow the unambiguous identification of histone modifications associated with particular chromatin fractions. Such techniques require specialist expertise which we will obtain by collaboration with Axel Imhof (University of Munich) allowing the establishment of this methodology for our use (and the use of others). Such methodology will negate the use of specific antisera or at least make their use less critical. Moreover, we also use mass spectrometry to better define the specificity of antibodies directed against histone modifications. Genetic studies of the archetypal epigenetic phenomenon of position-effect variegation (PEV) have proved invaluable for identifying key components and modifiers of chromatin structure. In PEV, a gene located abnormally close to heterochromatin is stochastically silenced in a proportion of cells in which it is normally expressed. The extent of silencing in PEV is dependent on histone-modifying enzymes and proteins that bind to the specific sites created by these enzymes. In three model organisms (yeast, Drosophila and mice), we will determine the modifications associated with silent chromatin. Subsequently, the histone-tail residues carrying these modifications will then be altered by targeted mutagenesis (in yeast) to directly test the role of particular histone tail (H3 and H4) amino acids in the establishment of gene silencing/activation and centromere function.

56	Professor Richard Festenstein	MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences	None	2009-04-07	2012-04-06	Applying epigenetic modifying drugs to treat Friedreich's Ataxia	We have recently shown that the GAA-triplet-repeat that pathologically expands and silences the frataxin (FXN) gene in the commonest autosomal recessive ataxia, Friedreich's Ataxia (FRDA), mediates transgene silencing in a manner reminiscent of chromatin-mediated silencing (Saveliev et al., 2003). This has led to the development of HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) which can upregulate frataxin (Festenstein, 2006; Herman et al., 2006) and are therefore potential treatments for this, as yet, untreatable and devastating condition. This proposal is to take forward a particular HDACi, known as compound z (due to patent restrictions), which we have found to be effective in up-regulating frataxin greater than 2-fold in lymphoblastoid cell lines and primary cells from patients with FRDA. Direct comparison with the HDACi, 4b, shows it to be more effective and it is certainly less toxic. As compound z has already been shown to have an excellent safety profile in humans and to cross the blood brain barrier, it has clear potential as a therapy for FRDA. We will now investigate its effects in humanised mouse models of FRDA. Thus, we will treat mice with the inhibitor and analyse the tissues that are characteristically affected by FRDA, such studies are clearly not possible in humans. Tissues will be analysed for FXN expression, FXN chromatin structure and for pathological changes. The mice will also be crossed to epigenetic-modifier mice to further dissect the mechanism of silencing and mechanism of action of this and other potential novel treatments at the chromatin/transcriptional level. FRDA can therefore be seen as a prototypic disease in which gene-silencing is the cause. We are well-placed to undertake this study as all the necessary techniques are already well established in the lab. Moreover, the CSC has a critical mass of researchers interested in epigenetics making this an ideal environment to pursue these studies. Compound z has a real possibility to become a treatment for FRDA, this study will go a long way to developing this potential.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	372376.0	GBP
57	Prof Richard Meehan	University of Edinburgh	None	2018-04-01	2023-03-31	The functional requirement for epigenetic systems in development and disease	Epigenetics can be defined as an alteration in gene activity that is mitotically stable in the absence of a change in DNA sequence. In practice it represents a combination of observations and suggested mechanisms that are thought to functionally organize the genome to regulate gene expression, preserve genome integrity, propagate cell identity and govern transcriptional responses to external stimuli. Our aim is to determine the molecular mechanisms of epigenetic gene regulation that are associated with DNA modification in development and by implication in disease model systems Recent work (including our own) in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) suggests that signal transduction pathways determine epigenetic states and not vice-versa. Most surprisingly we find that cell transition states in ESCs (primed to ground state and vice versa) are independent of global DNA methylation status. This work resulted in system with which we can directly investigate the mechanisms involved in over-riding the repressive effects of DNA methylation at target promoters, which will have important implications for understanding how activation and silencing of DNA methylated genes (and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs)) occurs in development and disease. Our previous analysis suggested that general aberrant promoter hypermethylation in cancer does not necessarily directly promote tumorigenesis, but instead reinforces transcription repression inherited from pre-cancerous tissue. Our work in ESCs has led us to develop new models to explain the molecular basis of this observation, which potentially de-links de novo methylation of promoters as a direct driver of disease processes and perhaps physiologic states (ageing). We have also observed that global DNA methylation states impacts on Polycomb Repression Complexes (PRC1 and 2) dependent chromatin compaction in the nucleus of embryonic stems cells (ESCs). Currently we are investigating the molecular models involved in facilitating DNA methylation directed changes in higher order chromatin organisation and its relevance to developmental gene regulation. We use various ESC models and in vitro models for early development to address how defects in defined aspects of the DNA methylation machinery influence the transition of stem cells to more committed cell fates. Increased understanding of these basic processes underpins the interpretation and relevance of altered epigenetic profiles in disease, ageing, drug screening programs and environmental exposure.

Certain combinations of genotype and nutritional exposure might greatly modify the risk of disease through so-called effect concentration. Due to the complexity of these interactions investigators have so far tended to study the main effects of each in isolation.||Iron is an important modulator of oxidative stress and, depending upon a variety of factors (concentration, location, sequestration, and redox state) can have both beneficial and harmful effects on host and pathogen alike. ||Iron-haptoglobin interactions in malaria and post-malaria anaemia: Haptoglobin binds free haemoglobin in the plasma, preventing it from exerting oxidant damage, and helping to transport haem iron to the liver. Haptoglobin genotype could influence both the oxidant state of plasma (with consequent effects on malarial parasite replication) and iron recycling for erythropoiesis. Recent studies from Sudan and Ghana indicate that the haptoglobin-2 allele protects against malaria. Analysis of historical data from rural Gambia indicates that haptoglobin genotype may also influence post-malarial anaemia. This project is using a series of prospective field studies to investigate haptoglobin/iron interactions in malaria.||Iron-haptoglobin interactions in HIV disease: Phenotypic differences in haptoglobin have been associated with immunosuppression, viral burden and mortality among HIV-1-infected adults (Hp2-2 increases risk), although the exact mechanism(s) are unknown. Iron also has independent effects on HIV disease progression. This study will test for synergisms between these effects using stored serum and DNA samples from a population-based cohort of >2000 adults followed since the late 1980s (HIV Clinical Cohort at MRC Laboratories, The Gambia).||Iron-NRAMP1 interactions in susceptibility to TB: Only a small proportion of the 2 billion people thought to be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis goes on to develop active TB. Host genetic and environmental factors, and interactions between them, may act as co-factors in the development of clinical disease. Mycobacteria colonise the macrophage phagosome, and host/pathogen competition for iron may influence the disease outcome. NRAMP1 acts as a divalent cation transporter on the phagosome membrane. NRAMP1 genotypes were first shown to influence human susceptibility to TB in The Gambia. This study also uses the MRC HIV Clinical Cohort to investigate iron-NRAMP interactions in determining disease susceptibility.||Nutrient-gene interactions are also being studied in relation to the regulation of fetal and post-natal growth using a large family-based cohort in rural Gambia and birthweight records for >5000 births. The first candidate gene being studied is the insulin variable number of tandem repeats (INS VNTR) which regulates the expression of the insulin-like growth factors. Additional studies of epigenetic events (including DNA methylation of imprinted-genes) in micronutrient programming during early development are also planned, using samples from this study and the periconceptional multiple micronutrient trial currently underway in Keneba. Understanding the factors that regulate fetal growth is important because birthweight is a crucial indicator of long-term health.	Medical Research Council	Unit	None	None

The new Molecular Pathology Masters programme will produce and sustain a generation of new academic pathologists and help create a virtual Centre for Molecular Pathology as a basis for a substantive MRC Centre in the longer term.

Clearly this involves the interaction of key cis-elements (e.g. enhancers, promoters and silencers) with trans-acting proteins (e.g. transcription factors, co-activators, adaptors and chromatin modifiers) that give rise to changes in gene expression which are associated with changes in epigenetic modification (methylation, replication, histone modification and nuclear position). We now need to understand the hierarchy and order of these events in gene regulation. We are studying expression of the a globin cluster in its natural chromosome environment during erythropoiesis as a model of mammalian gene expression. Our ultimate aim is to develop a comprehensive understanding of how mammalian genes are expressed from (or silenced within) their normal chromosomal environment and use this information to improve the management of patients with mutations in the globin genes that cause the human genetic disease thalassaemia. Ultimately any hypotheses about how the a globin genes are regulated have to be tested in experimental systems and at present this is achieved using interspecific hybrids in erythroid cells, stable transfectants of erythroid cells, transgenic mice and the use of ES cells to generate mice that have been modified using homologous recombination. We have recently developed a humanised mouse model that will allow us to study the human alpha cluster in a mouse background. Allowing functional studies that fully complement analysis of the transcriptional and epigenetic programmes. Over the past few years we have established high throughput assays to analyse all aspects of the transcriptional and epigenetic programmes controlling globin gene expression and we are now applying the principles learnt from globin to the entire human genome. Our ultimate aim is to develop a comprehensive understanding of how mammalian genes are expressed from their normal chromosomal environment and use this information to improve the management of patients with mutations in the globin genes that cause thalassaemia and related disorders.

Most of the basic and clinical research is in tobacco smoke-induced COPD. Non-smoking COPD is emerging as an important phenotype of COPD but is very poorly understood. The overall aim of this proposed study is to better characterise the non-smoking phenotype of COPD and to investigate how it differs from smoking COPD. Our main objectives are to: (1) Study and compare the clinical, physiological, radiological and inflammatory profiles in induced sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage, systemic inflammation and co-morbidities of non-smoking COPD with smoking-induced COPD in India and UK. We will also study disease progression of non-smoking COPD in India over 3 years; (2) Study bacterial colonization of lower airways in non-smoking COPD and exposed controls using culture and 16s rRNA metagenomic profiling, and whether this is linked to impaired bacterial phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils; (3) Study histone deacetylase and phosphoinositide-3-kinase activity in the sputum and alveolar macrophages of non-smoking COPD to better understand the molecular mechanisms of lung inflammation; (4) Study DNA methylation patterns of non-smoking COPD to understand epigenetic dysregulation; (5) Quantify and compare the black carbon content in the cytoplasm of alveolar macrophages from biomass smoke-induced COPD and smoking COPD subjects; (6) Study the impact of replacing biomass fuel with liquefied petroleum gas on indoor air pollution, alveolar black carbon content and its effects on lung health using physiological and sputum cellular and inflammatory mediator profiles. The study will be conducted using well established and validated methods and will provide new knowledge in this field of respiratory medicine that will not only benefit clinicians, respiratory researchers, public health workers, pharmaceutical industry, but also the policy makers.

Europe and the main break crop in the cereal rotation, grown on increasing acreage in the UK. The variety of food and non-food end uses require continuity of supply, with consistent high yield and predictable seed composition. These need to be achieved with reduced levels of inputs and in variable growing environments. The project integrates several approaches to develop an understanding of the genes and mechanisms underlying regulation of key traits affecting oilseed yield and composition. Specific targets: 1. Using comparative genomics and quantitative genetics to resolve loci affecting seed development and associated traits 2. Establishing how the rate of seed development affects harvestable seed size and quality 3. Determining how epigenetic processes affect plant development in different environments.

Thus, we have established that birthweight and weight at one year are determinants of adult bone mass and osteoporotic fracture, independently of other adult risk factors such as cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise and calcium nutrition. Preliminary data suggest important interactions between birthweight and certain genes which predict adult bone mass (such as those for growth hormone and vitamin D receptor). Our mother-offspring studies have confirmed that maternal smoking, low maternal fat stores and high maternal physical activity in late gestation, are independently associated with reduced neonatal bone mineral in the offspring. In addition, sub-optimal maternal vitamin D status (prevalence 25%) is associated with impaired placental calcium transport and significantly reduced whole body bone mineral content in the offspring at birth and 9 years. We have started to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these observations. Thus epigenetic changes allow environmental factors to influence gene expression and provide a mechanism linking early life factors to later health and disease. Our future research programme builds on these observations. Having established that the environment during early life influences the later risk of osteoporotic fracture, we need to: (a) gain a greater understanding of interactions between genetic markers of osteoporosis, the intrauterine/early postnatal environment, and adult lifestyle, as determinants of bone strength, propensity to skeletal trauma and fracture risk; (b) characterise the endocrine and metabolic perturbations in humans which mediate the effect of the early environment; (c) identify the precise, modifiable, environmental characteristics responsible for poor skeletal and muscle development (for example, maternal vitamin D status or physical activity); (d) understand the mechanisms through which these characteristics alter long-term growth and body composition, at both system and molecular level (for example, epigenetic changes influencing placental calcium transport); and (e) construct a platform for intervention studies in young women aiming to optimize skeletal health in the offspring: Thus, using a randomised controlled trial, we are exploring the role of vitamin D supplementation of pregnant women to optimize bone strength in the offspring; a further intervention study is examining the impact on infant health of a complex intervention aimed at improving mothers lifestyle and diet before and during pregnancy.

67	Prof Caroline Fall	University of Southampton	None	2013-05-01	2020-12-31	Nutrition, Development and Lifelong Health: Studies in Developing and Transitioning Populations	Past research in this programme has shown that the maternal undernutrition, and low birthweight and infant weight gain typical of poor rural populations in India are associated with reduced lean mass, bone mass and cognitive function in childhood and/or adult life, and an increased risk of low birthweight and stunting in the next generation. When early life undernutrition is followed by rapid childhood and adolescent weight gain or excessive adult weight gain, features that are enabled by economic transition and urbanisation, there is a high risk of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and CVD. In women, this transition increases the risk of gestational diabetes, which also causes insulin resistance and diabetes in the next generation. Poor diet quality, leading to inadequate intakes of a range of vitamins and minerals, is common among poor rural and urban women, and is associated with lower birthweight. Vitamin B12 deficiency is common in India for cultural reasons, and may be a particularly important nutritional deficit in this population. Maternal vitamin B12 deficiency is associated with low birthweight, insulin resistance in the children, and increased maternal adiposity and gestational diabetes. A major focus of our future work will be on intervention studies. Of several possible intervention points in the dual cycle of risk, we have chosen the adolescent and young adult age group, with the objective of improving the health of young women before pregnancy, improving pregnancy outcomes and reducing metabolic/CVD risk in the children. Interventions will be designed not only for overtly undernourished women, but also for middle class urban women because they too, and their children, are at risk. Alongside these intervention studies, we will continue to follow-up our existing birth cohorts, to better define associations between early life factors and risk markers for later disease, disease endpoints (CVD and T2DM), bone health and cognition. In the Delhi study, we will explore inter-generational associations for these outcomes, by studying children of the cohort. Like the other ERC programmes, we will utilise the intervention and cohort studies to explore epigenetic mechanisms as a possible link between early nutrition and later outcomes. Other international collaborations will include studies of social factors in early life in relation to adult health and disease, and studies of the economic impact of impaired early development.

We have preliminary evidence of such effects in humans and now propose to create an India/Gambia/UK partnership to extend this work by studying children of mothers randomised to receive pre- and peri-conceptional micronutrient supplements or placebo. We will analyse DNA methylation in 5-8 year old children whose mothers took part in the Mumbai Maternal Nutrition Project in India (MMNP; ISRCTN 62811278; n=1100 children) and the Peri-conceptional Multiple Micronutrient Supplementation Trial in rural Gambia (PMMST; ISRCTN 13687662; n=350) to identify differences between intervention and control groups. In an initial discovery phase we will measure genome-wide methylation using the Illumina Human Infinium 450K bead chip employing screens for differentially methylated positions (DMPs), regions (DMRs), and variably methylated regions (VMRs) with validation of top hits by bisulfite pyrosequencing. Candidate loci not present on the 450K array will also be assayed by pyrosequencing. We hope to confirm that maternal micronutrient supplementation reduces disrupted methylation of key genes. We will further correlate differences in methylation with health-related outcomes in the children (body composition, cardiometabolic risk markers and cognitive ability). The project will build capacity for next-generation epigenetic research in India and sub-Saharan Africa. It offers a highly efficient means to explore fundamental questions of human developmental biology. If we show that improving a mother's peri-conceptional diet by micronutrient supplementation minimises epigenetic disruption and improves metabolic health in the child, with potential lifelong benefit, our findings will offer a scalable pathway to impact in mothers worldwide.

We aim to: (1) maximise the potential of the ERC cohorts to enable the definition of developmental influences on major childhood and adult disorders, and examine hypotheses relating to prenatal/postnatal mismatch, epigenetic processes and economic consequences; and (2) conduct intervention studies in young women to improve their health and that of their children. Research proposals: Within the SWS and our other mother-offspring cohorts we shall examine the hypothesis that maternal and lifestyle influences from before conception, and mismatches between the fetal/infant and later childhood environment, have detrimental effects on body composition, cardiovascular structure and function, respiratory disease and atopy, and cognition. Data from Helsinki and from other European cohorts will be used to increase our understanding of influences on major adult disorders, notably cardiovascular disease and cancer. Within our EpiGen consortium we aim to define epigenetic biomarkers of later disease risk that will inform intervention studies. Our data resources spanning the lifecourse provide opportunities for comprehensive mechanistic and behavioural insights into chronic diseases and markers at different stages of life. Moreover, in an international collaboration we are defining the economic consequences of a poor start to life, which will inform public health policy and assess the potential impact of focused interventions. Finally, our work has led to four interventions to improve the diets and health behaviours of young women. Three of these target women in pregnancy. The fourth focuses on women of child-bearing age who already have young children. The aim is to improve the health of the women prior to any subsequent pregnancy and that of their children. Impact: Our work contributes to three current MRC research priorities: clinical and public health research, ageing-related research, and biomarkers. The work has a strong clinical and public health focus, our lifecourse approach increases understanding of ageing, and our work on epigenetic processes aims to identify biomarkers that assist in the characterisation of new interventions to improve public health. Our cohort studies will provide evidence as to whether mismatches between the maternal, infant and childhood environments are associated with cardiovascular risk, impaired respiratory health, cognitive development, and obesity. Our intervention studies will provide translational data on the benefits of better nutrition of young women, and have the potential to improve the health of women and children now, and that of future generations.

It is an important process during animal early development for setting up and maintaining stable patterns of gene transcription in adult tissues. In essence it describes how modification of chromatin or DNA regulates a genes activity.||Our main interest is determining the interplay between chromatin and DNA based silencing mechanisms in maintaining gene silencing during early animal development? We have made some exciting discoveries establishing the importance of epigenetic regulators in determining the onset of transcription during early development in amphibians, and how mis-regulation of these processes may lead to apoptosis and subsequent alterations in cellular identity and development.||The maintenance cytosine methyltransferase, xDnmt1, is responsible for maintaining high levels of DNA methylation in development. We have shown that it also acts as a direct transcription repressor protein, independently of its catalytic function, in early embryos. In addition we have identified a potential pathway though which loss of xDnmt1 function results in direct activation of a cell death pathway.||We believe our findings have important implications for the molecular basis of diverse human diseases in which epigenetic regulation is altered and potentially an understanding of the nature of cellular potency (stem cells). Our work may also contribute to the development of safe health care applications such as small molecule inhibitors of Dnmt1 function.	Medical Research Council	Unit	None	None

Cellular identity and gene expression is controlled in part by DNA methylation profiles. Fibroblast activation involves the demethylation of fibrosis markers such as αSMA, however the molecular mechanisms that result in DNA demethylation are unknown. Additionally, p38-MAPK signalling is critical to fibroblast activation and myofibroblast differentiation. We have discovered that p38 has a novel epigenetic function in regulating genome-wide DNA methylation. Activation of p38 results in KAT5-dependent acetylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation of DNMT1, a critical epigenetic writer that maintains DNA methylation during replication. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesise that p38-mediated DNA methylation changes are required for cardiac fibrosis. Complementary in vivo and in vitro experimental approaches will address the role of DNA hypomethylation in 1) cardiac fibrosis initiation and 2) the regulation of myofibroblast gene expression. Finally, we will translate our mechanistic findings by testing novel KAT5 inhibitors as fibrosis prevention agents. The findings will provide valuable insight into the epigenetic regulation of cardiac fibrosis and the identification of KAT5 as a novel molecular target for the prevention of cardiac fibrosis.

The maintenance of HSCs and their ability to respond to the requirements for differentiated cells requires tight regulation of the balance between cell division (self-renewal) and commitment to differentiate. The regulation of gene expression is central to the behaviour of HSCs, and recently a number of transcriptional regulators have been demonstrated to play a role, although the details of the molecular mechanisms involved and the interplay between different regulators remains unclear. We have identified the c-Myb protein, which is known to be essential for haemopoietic development, as an essential regulator of HSC maintenance. In HSCs, c-Myb appears to influence expression of other transcription factors and signalling molecules that are themselves known to be important in stem cell function. The proposed project aims to investigate the link between c-Myb and the transcription factor Ikaros, and the role that both proteins play in controlling expression of the stem cell receptor tyrosine kinases c-Kit and Flt-3. Purified bone marrow HSCs will be derived from mice genetically modified to express lower levels of c-Myb or undergoing conditional ablation of the c-myb gene. c-Myb-dependent changes in Ikaros expression as well as the overall influence of c-Myb on gene regulation will be probed directly in purified HSCs by in situ immunofluorescence using antibodies against Ikaros or histone modifications characteristic of gene repression or activation. The part played by Ikaros in the overall effect of reduced c-Myb activity will be determined by infection of modified HSCs with Ikaros-expressing lentiviruses. To investigate the mechanism by which c-Myb affects Ikaros gene expression, we will use DNAse hypersensitivity and histone modifications as indicators of chromatin remodelling and transcriptional activity. The initial studies on the Ikaros gene will be performed in a model HSC line, but we will also apply a novel procedure for chromatin immunoprecipitation to investigate epigenetic marks of gene regulation in small numbers of purified HSCs, comparing the Ikaros gene locus in conditions of normal or reduced c-Myb expression.

IPF is characterised by fibroblast accumulation and activation and excessive collagen deposition, leading to distortion of the alveolar architecture, progressive loss of lung function, and ultimately death. Myofibroblasts are the primary effector cells in IPF and can be differentiated from lung fibroblasts and epithelial cells. PGE2, a major prostanoid generated by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) from lung fibroblasts and epithelial cells, inhibits myofibroblast differentiation through cAMP. However, PGE2 is reduced due to COX-2 repression in this process, leading to unopposed myofibroblast differentiation. Increasing evidence suggests that epigenetic regulation plays a key role in myofibroblast differentiation and that cAMP elevating agents can compensate for exogenous PGE2 loss to prevent and even reverse myofibroblast differentiation. We hypothesize that lung fibroblasts and epithelial cells are epigenetically reprogramed during their differentiation to myofibroblasts in IPF, resulting in gene specific epigenetic modifications relative to the expression and repression key genes and that cAMP elevating agents can prevent, even reverse, the differentiation at least partly through epigenetic regulation. We aim to elucidate the epigenetic mechanisms and cAMP-mediated inhibition of myofibroblast differentiation by studying TGF-beta1-induced fibroblast-to-myofibrobalst differentiation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in vitro, validating key epigenetic findings relative to gene expression in IPF lung tissue and in a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis, and evaluating the anti-fibrotic effect of cAMP elevating agents and epigenetic inhibitors in the mouse model. The outcome of this project will improve our understanding of IPF pathogenesis and provide preclinical evidence for these agents as potential novel therapies to benefit IPF patients.

Objectives 1. To determine whether maternal alcohol consumption in pregnancy has a biological effect on adolescent drinking behaviours and the onset of problem drinking, independent of family history of problem drinking, parental drinking during the offspring‘s childhood and adolescence and other components of shared environment such as socio-economic position and neighbourhood circumstances. 2. To use maternal genetic variants that are known to be robustly associated with alcohol consumption as instrumental variables for the causal effect of maternal alcohol consumption on offspring consumption, with control for the same variants in offspring. 3. To determine whether risk-factors for adolescent drinking such as school performance and peer group choice, which are often linked to more important outcomes in the domains of cognition and development, are mediators of the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on adolescent drinking behaviours. 4. To determine whether prenatal alcohol exposure causes differences in methylation status of candidate genes associated with adolescent drinking and cognitive/developmental outcomes (epigenetic effect). 5. To determine whether paternal alcohol consumption pre-conception contributes to the adolescent alcohol phenotype and cognition/development, independently of intrauterine alcohol exposure and later drinking. 6. To study the association of prenatal alcohol exposure with cognitive and developmental outcomes using an instrumental variable approach and within-siblings comparisons, and to compare the results to those from a different population to strengthen their interpretation (UK Vs Norway). Methodology The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents And Children -N=15000- and the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort -N=100000- will prode data on parents (socio-demographic and lifestyle) and offspring (developmental and cognitive outcomes, adolescent drinking behaviour), collected prospectively since the index pregnancy. DNA banks exist for both studies. These will allow genotyping alcohol-related genetic variants, to be linked to offspring cognitive/behavioural/alcohol outcomes in instrumental variable analyses, and analysing offspring DNA methylation signatures. Relevant statistical methods - multivariable analysis, structural equation modelling, instrumental variables analysis - will be used as appropriate. Medical opportunities Understanding to what extent the association of maternal pregnancy alcohol intake with offspring initiation and amount of alcohol consumption is due to potentially irreversible intrauterine biological pathways, rather than shared familial lifestyles or shared genes, is important in order to determine strategies for the prevention of problem drinking in adolescents. This may be particularly important for female offspring, as their behaviour in pregnancy might affect their own offspring -an irreversible intrauterine effect could result in a trans-generational spiral.

Recent studies have shown that prenatal exposure to glucocorticoid ‘stress‘ hormones might underpin this association; treating pregnant rats with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone reduces birth weight, and causes lifelong hypertension and hyperglycaemia in the adult offspring. Intriguingly, these phenotypes are transmitted into subsequent generations without further dexamethasone treatment, suggesting glucocorticoids may induce epigenetic changes. Our recent studies on the liver show that prenatal dexamethasone associates with early-onset and lifelong overexpression of two key transcription factors that regulate metabolism, namely the glucocorticoid receptor GR and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4a). This may be of functional significance since hepatic expression of PEPCK, the rate-limiting step of gluconeogenesis and an important target of both GR and HNF4a, is also permanently increased. Hepatic GR and PEPCK expression is increased in other animal models of foetal programming of hyperglycaemia (maternal protein restriction or uterine artery ligation), suggesting that GR and/or HNF4a may mediate effects of various early environmental insults on subsequent hyperglycaemia. GR and HNF4a are also particularly important for development and function of the endocrine pancreas - where glucocorticoids inhibit insulin secretion from ß-cells and mutations of the HNF4a gene cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young1 (MODY1). Deranged expression of these genes in the pancreas would therefore have significant pathophysiological consequences and may contribute to hyperglycaemia in this model. The main aim of the proposed research is to elucidate the fundamental molecular mechanisms through which prenatal glucocorticoid exposure causes permanent hyperglycaemia. Specifically we will: 1) use a transgenic ach to test whether hepatic HNF4a over-expression is sufficient to induce PEPCK expression and hyperglycaemia; 2) examine whether prenatal dexamethasone alters GR and HNF4a expression in pancreatic beta-cells and determine whether changes affect long term beta-cell function (insulin secretion); 3) determine the methylation status of the GR and HNF4a promoters in order to elucidate the mechanisms through which dexamethasone increases expression of these genes and how this is transmitted across generations. These studies may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and its relationship with birth weight, as well as indicate targets for prevention and/or therapy. If the epigenetic changes could easily be determined with a blood sample, it would allow early testing (before disease manifestation) in children with low birth weight or those treated with glucocorticoids perinatally to accelerate lung maturity in cases of premature labour.

Invasion by viral DNA threatens cellular integrity and therefore needs to be detected and suppressed. As the default cellular response is to silence incoming DNA, how do viruses subvert and exploit this hostile environment to their advantage? Our identification of the ‘Human Silencing Hub’ (HUSH) as a novel epigenetic transcriptional repressor complex, responsible for silencing newly integrated retroviruses, has motivated us to further investigate chromatin regulation of viral infection. We wish to: (i) Understand how HUSH silences newly integrated viral DNA. (ii) Determine how lentiviruses antagonize chromatin-mediated repression and identify shared mechanisms by which unrelated, non-integrated viruses counteract silencing. (iii) Understand how and why the lentiviral-Vif accessory protein manipulates the host cell phosphoproteome. To help address these questions we have developed and optimised powerful genetic and proteomic screening technologies. Repurposing CRISPR-Cas9 will enable RNA-guided genome manipulations, including selection of informative point mutants and isolation of DNA sequence-specific regulatory proteins. Together these approaches provide a discovery platform to determine how repressive heterochromatin is established and maintained, how viruses manipulate their chromatin environment and ultimately to develop new therapeutic tools to enable their eradication.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and lethal fibrotic lung disorder with unknown etiology and no effective treatment. The expression of the antifibrotic enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and the angiostatic chemokine IP-10 in response to profibrotic cytokines (e.g. TGFbeta1 and IL-1beta) is downregulated in IPF, leading to a profibrotic and angiogenic environment and contributing to the fibrotic process in IPF. We have demonstrated that the downregulation in lung fibroblasts fro m IPF patients (F-IPF) is primarily transcriptional due to epigenetic abnormality in the form of histone deacetylation. Our preliminary studies also suggest that both histone and DNA methylation may play key roles in this downregulation. We hypothesise that aberrant histone and DNA methylation is responsible for the downregulation of the two genes. We will compare F-IPF and fibroblasts from nonfibrotic lung (F-NL) to test the hypothesis. We will assess histone and DNA methylation state at the ge ne promoters, explore the order of events and the interplay between different epigenetic pathways, identify the key molecules that trigger and guide this process, and explore the possibility of restoring COX-2 and IP-10 expression. The outcome of the studies will improve our understanding of IPF and may prove highly beneficial for novel therapeutic strategies.	Wellcome Trust	Project Grant	220540.0	GBP

The fact that these cells can be isolated from individual patients makes them amenable to use as an autologous cell source. Research is emerging from both the MSC and iPS field suggesting that adult cells retain a functional epigenetic memory of their developmental histology. The clinical importance of MSCs makes it of great importance to understand the basis of this memory (programme) and how it affects their differentiation and response to tissue injury. In this study we aim to investigate the molecular basis of epigenetic programming of cells (pericytes) that are now generally accepted as a source of MSC in most tissues. The general concept we have formulated is that pericytes are programmed, as a result of their developmental origins, in order to restrict their differentiation potential in vivo. If this is true it has important consequences for their clinical use. We will use the latest approaches in epigenetic analysis and gene expression profiling to identify differences between pericytes of different origins. We will use heterotypic transplantation of pericytes following tissue damage to correlate repair efficiency with epigenetic (gene expression) status and finally carry out reprogramming experiments to determine the extent to which this improves repair efficiency.

H1 is also associated with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and the basis of the increased risk is due to allele-specific elevations of MAPT transcription and changes in splicing of the alternatively spliced exons 2, 3 and 10. However, differences in DNA methylation of H1 and its inverted allelic counterpart, H2, suggest that the haplotypes are subject to different epigenetic modifications due to the different chromatin contexts of the inverted variants. Epigenetic changes in the form of DNA methylation and histone modifications are important regulators of gene expression and, we hypothesise that differences in chromatin context form an important basis of the allelic differences in gene expression. The particular aim of this proof of principle study is to develop quantitative allele-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation (haploChIP) protocols to identify H1/H2 differences in histone modifications that reflect the transcriptionally permissive, unfolded chromatin and the repressive, closed chromatin and how they correlate to rate of transcription and splicing. We will model this study on the H1/H2 heterozygous human neuroblastoma cell lines with focused haploChIP of targets within the MAPT promoter region that we have shown to harbour critical functional SNPs that are important drivers of H1 risk.

However, Gc exert variable effects, for reasons which remain unclear. We have discovered that in inflammation MERM1, an important epigenetic regulator of GR function is degraded. This is due to cytokine induction of MERM1 ubiquitinylation, and proteasome digestion. The same cytokines impair GR function. GR function is rescued by restoration of MERM1 expression, by mutating the ubiquitinylation sites. The importance of MERM1 to human lung disease is exemplified by finding loss of MERM1 protein expression across a panel of human inflammatory lung disease histological sections. The mechanisms underlying MERM1 action in the lung will be explored using human bronchial epithelial cells, and macrophages in-vitro. The impact of MERM1 loss on responses to inflammatory challenge and Gc treatment will be measured. The broader actions of MERM1 will be measured using RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq protocols targeting both MERM1, and GR under conditions of induced inflammation, and Gc exposure. These datasets will be subject to detailed bioinformatics analysis to reveal other MERM1 dependent transcription factors operative in these cells under inflammatory challenge, and to define the spectrum of Gc targets that are MERM1 regulated. We now seek to make a bronchial epithelium-targeted MERM1 deletant mouse, and compare this to littermate controls in a series of pulmonary inflammatory challenges, including allergic, and rhinoviral infection protocols. The impact of MERM1 loss in the bronchial epithelium will be determined on elaboration, and resolution of inflammation. In particular we will investigate the impact of MERM1 loss on the anti-inflammatory actions of Gc. The gene target and pathway discovery approaches above will be tested in primary human lung tissue and cells from patients with Gc resistant asthma.

The current therapeutic arsenal that is available to clinicians has evolved exponentially in recent decades but none of the current biological therapies have been exclusively designed to mechanistically target both the inflammatory and erosive aspects of RA. We have recently discovered that using an immunoglobulin-mediated approach we can specifically affect both inflammatory and erosive pathways. These findings provide us with new insights that reveal an innovative therapeutic strategy for their dual regulation in rheumatic diseases. We plan to build on these initial findings by fully elucidating the immunoglobulin-mediated modulation of macrophage and osteoclast biology and using this information to design a pioneering therapy. Our key goals are to investigate the immunoglobulin form/composition and epigenetic pathways underlying this modulation. By achieving these objectives, we will significantly increase our fundamental understanding of the mode of action of Fc receptor modulation on macrophage and osteoclast differentiation and activation, as well as on the pathological mechanisms of bone disease. In addition, we will produce a new treatment that can exploit these mechanisms to simultaneously target inflammation and joint erosion in patients.

83	Professor Osbourn	John Innes Centre	None	None	2013-10-31	Functional significance of clustering of genes for the tissue-specific synthesis of defence-related secondary metabolites in cereals	Avenacins are antimicrobial triterpenoid saponins that are produced in oat roots. Our evidence indicates that genes for biochemically distinct steps in avenacin biosynthesis are clustered in the oat genome. This is one of only two known gene clusters for secondary metabolism in plants so far, although several such clusters are known in fungi. This finding raises important questions concerning the corregulation of the clustered genes and whether clustering is a widespread feature of genomic organisation in plants. We have cloned the gene encoding oat beta-amyrin synthase (Sad1), the enzyme that catalyses the first committed step in avenacin synthesis and are sequencing up to 1Mb of the region encompassing this gene as part of a complementary project. We have also cloned a Sad2 candidate (AsCypA), which is about 100Kb from Sad1 and is predicted to encode a novel cytochrome P450. In this project we will investigate the epigenetic regulation of genes within this region in avenacin producing and non-producing tissues. We will use a combination of biochemical and structural methods to characterise histone and DNA modifications that accompany transcriptional regulation, including chromatin immunoprecipitation and a novel fluorescence in situ hybridisation method applied to chromatin fibres. We will also determine whether transcriptional activation is accompanied by 3-dimensional changes in the nuclear localisation of the genes under investigation using confocal microscopy. Initial experiments will focus on Sad1 and AsCypA along with reference genes outside the region. Further Sad gene candidates within the cluster will be identified from the BAC sequence output and subjected to expression analysis. We will then extend the investigation of epigenetic regulation and organisational changes to genes emerging from this analysis. This is a multidisciplinary project that brings together chromosome and nuclear biology and bioimaging with the integrated approaches used by the Osbourn to address an important question in plant biology.

Aims of the programme: Genomic imprinting is process causing genes to be expressed according to their parental origin. At mammalian imprinted domains the two parental chromosome homologues function differently despite having the same sequence due to distinct epigenetic modifications on DNA and chromatin, and non-coding transcription that influences parental allele-specific gene expression. Comparing maternally and paternally inherited chromosomes results in genomic imprinting being an excellent paradigm to study cis-regulation and the epigenetic control of transcription in mammalian cells. Here we propose a programme that aims to make links between the underlying DNA sequence, conserved genomic features, epigenetic control, and gene activity and repression at an imprinted domain. Integrated in vivo experiments have been developed, focusing on the 1Mb Dlk1-Dio3 imprinted domain, to address the following key questions: What is the regional influence of large repetitive tracts in ma mmals? (experiment 1) What is the functional importance of physical juxtaposition of long-range cis-acting regulatory interactions? (experiments 2 & 3) Do evolutionary conserved non-coding regions contribute to domain-wide regulation? (experiments 2 & 3) Are large and small non-coding RNA transcripts in the domain, a cause or a consequence of genomic imprinting - what is their role?

Evidence from epidemiological studies and experiments in animal models suggests that effects of environment and lifestyle can be transmitted across generations via non-genetic mechanisms. Such mechanisms are challenging to unravel in mouse and man. In mammals, non-genetic inheritance is best exemplified by the Agouti viable yellow (Avy) mouse where phenotypic differences in genetically identical animals are caused by insertion of a retrotransposon - an endogenous retrovirus (ERV) that provides a cryptic promoter driving ectopic expression of agouti. This ERV is variably DNA methylated in different individuals causing inter-individual variation in coat colour – a non-genetic influence on phenotype. Remarkably, a memory of parental coat colour is transmitted to subsequent generations. Variable expressivity can be modulated by in utero environmental exposures. ERVs represent ~12% of the mouse genome. Inspired by Avy, we propose a research programme, supported by preliminary data, to address the following questions: Aim 1 – To what extent do mammalian ERVs exhibit variable epigenetic silencing and what is the mechanism? Aim 2 – Is this transmitted as non-genetic memory across generations? Aim 3 – Are they sensors of environmental compromise? Aim 4 – Are there implications for phenotype? Aim 5 – Does a related phenomenon occur in humans?	Wellcome Trust	Investigator Award in Science	2929851.0	GBP
87	Dr Goodrich	University of Edinburgh	None	None	2024-11-30	Genetic screens for novel polycomb-group genes in Arabidopsis	Polycomb-group (Pc-G) genes control cell fate in plant and animals by mediating mitoitically stable states of homeotic gene expression. However, in plants, cell fates can be reprogrammed relatively easily compared to animals. This suggests that there are differences in the mechanism of Pc-G action between plants and animals. The Pc-G genes that confer an epigenetic mark, methylation of specific lysine residues on histone H3, are conserved between plants and animals. However, the genes that interpret this mark and convert it to transcriptional repression in animals are not conserved, suggesting that plants use different genes. To identify these genes, genetic screens are proposed using customised genetic backgrounds.	Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council	grant	69714.0	GBP

In mouse embryos lacking the maintenance methyltransferase Dnmt1, imprinting of all genes studied is disrupted. However we have recently found that imprinting of several genes in an imprinting cluster (on distal chromosome 7) is maintained faithfully in Dnmt1- mutants in extraembryonic tissues (placenta). Deletion of an imprinting control region which produces a non-coding antisense transcript (IC2), by contrast, results in loss of silencing. We find that in the placenta the silent genes are marked by repressive histone tail modifications, which are disrupted by IC2 deletion. Thus imprinting in extraembryonic tissues seems to involve epigenetic marks other than DNA methylation. We will determine the developmental sequence of establishment of these marks and imprinted expression of the genes, in relation to antisense RNA expression, using a conditional mutant of IC2. Trans-acting factors such as the polycomb gene Eed and G9a will be investigated. The discovery and characterization of a new imprinting mechanism will provide exciting insights into specific diseases and perhaps the association between epigenetic disorders and IVF , as well as cloning and cell plasticity.

90	Prof Wolf Reik	Babraham Institute	None	None	2008-08-31	Imprinting mechanisms in extraembryonic tissues	An important part of gene regulation during development involves so-called epigenetic marks. These are chemical additions (for example methyl groups) to the DNA or to the chromatin (the histone proteins) and instruct genes to be active or inactive. There is increasing evidence that faults in these epigenetic marks can lead to diseases in humans, particularly those affecting growth or behaviour. Recently it has been realised that defects in cloned animals and some rare diseases that occur in children born form IVF, can be explained by defective epigenetic marks. Mistakes and mutation in imprinting and epigenetic gene regulation are increasingly in many human diseases and in cancers. In this application, we describe work on a new epigenetic mechanism based on attachment of methyl groups to histones, rather than DNA. It is likely that histone methylation confers a less stable imprint than DNA methylation and this could be relevant to the defects that occur in disease; further work as proposed in this application to the histone methylation mechanism will lead to insights into the stability or vulnerability of these marks to cloning and to environmental influences such as those occurring in IVF.

Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation or histone tail marks can be acquired by different mechanisms and triggers. In yeast and plants it is established that small RNAs (RNAi) can lead to epigenetic marking. In mammals it is not known if the same pathway exists. This student project uses mouse models which lack a key enzyme (Dicer) that is essential for the production of small RNAs potentially involved in epigenetic marking. The effects on DNA methylation and imprinting will be tested.	Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council	Institute CSG	116224.0	GBP
92	Prof Wolf Reik	Babraham Institute	Developmental Genetics and Imprinting	2008-01-02	2012-01-01	Role of cytidine deaminases in epigenetic reprogramming and demethylation of DNA	DNA methylation of CpG dinucleotides is an important mechanism of epigenetic regulation of genome function in mammals, and has key roles in genomic imprinting, X chromosome inactivation, silencing of transposons, genome stability, and developmental gene expression. Aberrant regulation of DNA methylation is implicated in many human diseases, particularly cancers. DNA methylation is reprogrammed genome wide in the zygote and preimplantation embryo, and in primordial germ cells. Reprogramming involves active demethylation, and is important for the erasure of genomic imprints, and likely for the return of the embryonic genome to totipotency. We have shown that cytidine deaminases such as Aid and Apobec1 can deaminate 5 methylcytosine (5meC) in DNA, leading to T:G mismatches which can be repaired by the base excision repair pathway. These genes are part of a pluripotency gene cluster and are expressed in oocytes and germ cells in which demethylation occurs. We have recently targeted Aid in transgenic mice to a highly methylated region of the genome, and find that this region is efficiently and substantially (approx 90%) demethylated without incurring sequence mutations. Preliminary work shows that Aid deficient zygotes have a deficit in the demethylation of the paternal genome. Having obtained proof-of-principle evidence that Aid can initiate demethylation in vivo, we are now building upon this work to fully understand the mechanisms involved as well as the physiological relevance. The aim of the proposed work is to elucidate in depth the role of Aid/Apobec family deaminases in epigenetic reprogramming and demethylation of DNA in vivo. The specific objectives are 1. the full characterisation of the gain-of-function experiments in which Aid and Apobec1 are targeted to methylated regions in the mouse genome in vivo 2. the characterisation of the pathways downstream of Aid which resolve base mismatches, using Xrcc1 and TDG conditional knockouts 3. the completion of a conditional Aid-Apobec1 knockout, followed by phenotypic characterisation and its combination with Apobec2 and -3 knockouts and 4. the analysis of endogenous DNA methylation including by methylDIP in these knockouts. This work will not only elucidate the mechanisms of epigenetic reprogramming and demethylation, but it will also have direct applications in regenerative medicine and cancer therapy approaches, some of which are already being persued in industrial collaborations.

93	Prof Wolf Reik	Babraham Institute	None	None	2012-01-01	BBSRC DTG studentship (Fees only): Epigenetic reprogramming in the germline	Mammalian germ cells (eggs and sperm) have enormous potential for regenerating a rejuvenated genome, in other words the germline is immortal, while somatic cells (any cell in the body other than an egg or sperm) undergo ageing and eventually die. One process that is likely to play a crucial role in rejuvenation is 'epigenetic reprogramming' by which existing epigenetic chemical modifications to DNA and chromatin are removed on a genome wide level. The mechanisms of epigenetic reprogramming are essentially unknown. This student project aims to identify on a genome wide scale the genes which are reprogrammed and which chemical modifications are removed at what timepoint. This will open up the way for mechanistic studies which will help to unravel the secret of the immortal germline.	Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council	Institute CSG	156163.0	GBP
94	Prof Wolf Reik	Babraham Institute	None	None	2012-01-01	Role of cytidine deaminases in epigenetic reprogramming and demethylation of DNA	Genetic information is passed from generation to generation and is the material upon which natural selection acts. On top of this genetic information the genome also contains epigenetic information in the form of chemical and other modifications to DNA, which are associated with gene expression and genome function. Epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation are of key importance in development, stem cell biology and regenerative medicine, and cancer. During certain periods of early development of an embryo, epigenetic modifications including DNA methylation are reprogrammed on a genome wide level. This may be important in order to establish totipotency (the ability to give rise to an entire organism) of the embryonic genome. The mechanisms of the removal of DNA methylation from the genome are unknown in mammals. This student project investigates a class of candidate enzymes in the mouse which have been shown to be able to chemically alter methylated cytosines. There are four of these candidate genes in the mouse genome, for three of which we have knockout mutations (to create inactive genes). A fourth knockout is being constructed, and knockouts will then be examined for altered DNA methylation and development. If methylated cytosines are chemically altered, the DNA needs to be repaired following this event. The project also investigates the DNA repair pathways which would be responsible.

Somatic cells (any cell in the body other than an egg or sperm) might be taken directly from patients, and their nuclei reprogrammed to a stem cell state (that can give rise to most tissues) by introduction of some key reprogramming factors, resulting in the generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. This process is inefficient and often incomplete, however, because of inefficient epigenetic reprogramming during generation of iPS cells. It is therefore important to begin to identify 'reprogramming factors' that is molecules or enzymes that are able to revert epigenetic modifications in somatic cells to those in stem cells. Epigenetic modifications occur in the form of chemical and other modifications to DNA, which are associated with gene expression and genome function. We have developed a screen which we think will be able to identify some of the factors that are important for epigenetic reprogramming.

A key factor in our understanding has been the observation that PKCε activation selectively modulates NF-κB transcriptional responses to induce cytoprotective genes, while suppressing pro-inflammatory pathways. Using a cell molecular and in vivo approach, we now propose to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying selective targeting of NF-κB cytoprotective transcripts by PKCε. A key aim will be to determine the influence of shear stress patterns on the activation of PKCε and NF-κB, and the subsequent induction of protective genes. Analyses will include investigation of post-translational modifications and epigenetic mechanisms, the study of physiological PKCε agonists and novel PKCε targets including CREB-1 and Nrf2, and demonstration of the functional importance of PKCε-NF-κB signalling in the vascular endothelium in vivo. Ultimately, the value of targeting PKCε therapeutically will be determined by understanding its associated signalling pathways. We anticipate that this approach will eventually lead to identification of optimal targets and novel therapeutics for vascular inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis.

Genetic studies have shown that genomic imprinting occurs at dosage-sensitive genes regulating important developmental processes. In human, altered imprinted gene expression is associated with growth, metabolic and neurological disorders, and cancer. Over the past 30 years, genomic imprinting has emerged as a paradigm contributing to our understanding of the roles of epigenetic modifications in the regulation of gene activity and repression, and to mechanisms underlying the epigenetic control of genome function in pathways important for development, health and disease. In this application we propose a series of experiments addressing three key important biomedically relevant topics concerning the regulation, function and evolution of genomic imprinting. These studies are designed not only to better understand imprinting in development and disease, but also to generate more widespread functional and regulatory insights into the epigenetic control of transcriptional dosage, and its impact on normal and abnormal phenotypes. Our three main aims are: 1 - To understand the extent and implications of parental-origin specific allelic bias. 2 - To further study one of the most biomedically relevant imprinted genes, Dlk1, and the previously uncharacterised non-imprinted Dlk2 gene from whence it arose, to assess the regulation, function and evolution of these remarkable paralogues in mammals using neurogenesis as a paradigm. 3 - To determine whether canonical imprinting, an essential mammalian regulator of nutritional resources, plays a role in the mammary gland - a key site of postnatal maternal-offspring interactions important for lifelong offspring health.

103	Dr Goodrich	University of Edinburgh	None	2009-10-19	2012-10-18	Application of genomics to dissect Polycomb-group gene mediated control of plant development (PcG-CODE)	Polycomb-group genes mediate many of the key developmental transitions that occur during plant development. Their target genes comprise many of the key transcription factors, signalling factors and other regulators that control plant developmental patterning. We and other groups have determined the genome wide distribution of the epigenetic mark, trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), that is deposited by Pc-G proteins at their targets. These profiling studies have defined a large group (about 4000 genes) of likely Pc-g targets. This resource has so far been little exploited. For example, the biological function of most targets is not known, nor is it known how Polycomb-group proteins binding correlates with methylation and how this changes during cell fate transitions when target gene activity may change. The first aim of the proposal is to determine the biological function of key target genes. To this end, we will develop bioinformatic tools to identify targets which show tissue specific expression and are predicted to have a developmental functions and which are likely to be non redundant. We will characterise the effect of gene knockouts on seed size, embryo development, seed viabilty and dormancy, flowering time, flower development, root growth and root morphology. Secondly, we will profile PRC2 components and how their binding changes during a developmental transition, the regeneration of plants during tissue culture.

Somatic cells might be taken directly from patients, and their nuclei reprogrammed to a stem cell (pluripotent) state by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) into oocytes. This scenario is difficult, however, because of inefficient epigenetic reprogramming during SCNT, and because of ethical difficulties with obtaining oocytes for this purpose. It is therefore important to begin to identify `reprogramming factors that is molecules or enzymes that are able to revert epigenetic modifications in somatic cells to those in stem cells.

With few exceptions, these changes occur without changes to DNA sequence. Changes in epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, histone variant deposition and the presence of non-nucleosomal chromatin-associated proteins are strongly linked to the transitions from totipotent to pluripotent stem cells, and precursor cells to fully differentiated somatic cells. Little is known about these interlaced systems work and interact. In this Collaboration Grant we propose to bring together a pre-eminent group of UK scientists working on epigenetics and chromatin during development. Our current funded research programmes are aimed at various and extensive epigenetic analyses of diverse ?developmental? cell-types; including primordial germ cells, developing oocytes, ES cells, blastocysts, TS cells, placenta, fetal liver and adult tissues. Presently these analyses are to be performed with real-time PCR, Sequenom massarray, or microarray based profiling, etc. Each of these techniques is limiting, either in terms of the number of samples or datapoints that can be assessed (PCR and Sequenom) or in the quality and quantitative value of data returned (array techniques). Rather than simply focussing on own little parts of the genome we propose to collaborate in the establishment of a new facility, to take advantage of improvements in DNA sequencing technology to create a database of genome-wide datasets representing an epigenetic time course through development. With the aid of an Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Solexa) massively parallel sequencing system we will generate genome-wide datasets for each experiment, rather than a tiny fragment of the genome. This will allow us to investigate the specific questions outlined in our present research programmes, while at the same time dramatically increasing the output and quality of each experiment. The data from each of the applicants will be deposited in a searchable database curated by the proposed postdoc. The net effect will be to create a programme that is substantially larger, more encompassing and providing much greater insight than the sum of the previous constituent parts. This collaborative database will foster interaction and sharing of expertise between applicants as well as create a shared resource for collaborative publications that would not have been possible without this grant.

Exit from pluripotency in turn requires rapid establishment of epigenetic memory in the form of epigenetic priming. This involves both ‘activating priming’ whereby lineage specific genes are protected from repressive marking to safeguard their future transcriptional activation during tissue and organ development, and ‘repressive priming’ by which genes of a different lineage are suppressed. These large-scale dynamics raise fundamental questions about the impact of epigenetic memory on pluripotency and differentiation, which we address in this research programme. First, we will attempt to disable global demethylation in vitro and in vivo by manipulating the epigenetic coordinator UHRF1 at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Second, using genetic and epigenetic manipulation we will determine the mechanisms and downstream consequences on lineage and tissue development of ‘activating priming’ factors we have recently identified. Third, we will investigate the role and targets of ‘repressive priming’ and epigenetic heterogeneity in cell fate decisions and lineage development. New insights gained into memory erasure and epigenetic determinants of cell fate will illuminate and guide strategies for using ES, iPS, and multipotent stem cells in regenerative medicine.

The exact nature of these epigenetic processes and the nutrients that induce them remains a black box". Due to the lack of a tractable human system to investigate the underlying mechanisms, this Industrial Partnership between the University of Nottingham and Syngenta aims to investigate the suitability of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and their hepatocyte derivatives as novel platforms for assessing the epigenetically-based benefits and risks of micro-nutrients. The project will focus on nutrients that contribute to the methionine/folate metabolic cycles that are particularly active in embryonic cells and hepatocytes, since these cycles produce the methyl groups required for DNA and histone methylation. Using high throughput cell culture screens, a wide range of nutrient dose and exposure time combinations can be evaluated on a scale not previously possible. Combined with high throughput sequencing evaluation of the epigenome, comprehensive analysis of the nature and extent of nutritional programming on epigenetic methylation reactions will be evaluated. This will inform optimal dietary choices for improved health and provide industrially-relevant tools to help develop new foodstuffs in the biosafe manner that Government regulators require increasingly."

This targeting process, directly or indirectly, can also target DNA and chromatin to introduce epigenetic modifications. In plants there are many hundreds of thousands - of different small silencing RNAs (sRNAs) produced from many thousands of loci. These sRNAs have enormous potential to influence genetic and epigenetic regulation because, from analysis of transgenes, it is clear that RNA silencing can have diverse effects. There can be RNA-mediated signalling between cells and complex interaction networks of RNA molecules with positive feedback and amplification loops. In addition there can be epigenetic effects that, once induced, can persist between generations. In REVOLUTION the aim is to find out which of the endogenous sRNAs have the various RNA silencing properties revealed by transgenes. The aim is then to integrate these findings into a systems level understanding of regulation and evolution in Arabidopsis. The role of these sRNA systems will be investigated in plants subjected to hormone and stress treatments. We shall also investigate the role of these sRNAs in natural variation between genotypes of plant and their effect in hybrids between these plants. In the final stages of the work it is intended to explore the various effects of endogenous sRNAs in plants other than Arabidopsis including tomato. This work will provide a new level of understanding of the mechanisms affecting gene expression in plants. This fundamental new understanding will affect crop science through conventional breeding and genetic engineering. In addition because RNA silencing takes place in animals including vertebrates there will be relevance of this work beyond plants.	European Research Council	Advanced Grant	2298433.0	EUR

In addition, the silencing is quantitatively modulated by the environment enabling dissection of how external cues mediate epigenetic silencing. We will combine genetics, molecular biology and biochemical approaches with computational modelling to allow us to translate the extensive nuts and bolts information into an understanding of how the engine works. A particular strength of modelling will be its predictive nature and ability to distinguish between key components and those with subsidiary or redundant roles. The system we will use is vernalization, the cold-induced Polycomb-silencing of the target locus, FLC. We will dissect the many phases of vernalization: the triggering of FLC repression by prolonged cold; the nucleation and epigenetic stability of chromatin changes at FLC; and the spreading of the silencing yet spatial restriction to FLC. Our goal will be a full understanding of the complexity involved in the epigenetic silencing of this locus, described in a quantitative model that reveals how the silencing is induced by temperature and how individual components of the silencing network are integrated into a robust whole. This ambitious goal, which will uncover fundamental concepts important to gene regulation in many organisms, will be achieved through a tight integration of molecular analysis and computational modelling, enabling efficient cycling between experimentation, prediction and validation.

They occur unpredictably, adding to the physical and psychological burden of the condition, and contribute to joint damage and comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease. Flares are difficult to study, precisely because of their unpredictable timing. However, we have established a human model that generates a 'synchronized' population of RA patients in clinical remission, of whom about 50% flare within 6 months, the remainder maintaining remission. We propose to carefully study such a population to better understand the factors that determine disease flare. Up to a third of patients with RA achieve disease remission with aggressive therapy. Many wish to discontinue therapy at this point and, if they do, about 50% flare in the subsequent 6 months. We will follow such a population prospectively, to study the biological processes underpinning flare. We will study 150 patients in clinical remission for at least 6 months, and prepared to discontinue treatment. After treatment cessation patients will be studied intensively, with blood sampling at weeks 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24. Patients will also undergo ultrasound-guided biopsy of 'flaring' synovium before reinstatement of previous treatment (with which patients readily regain remission). We will also obtain biopsies from consenting patients at baseline and in remission at 6 months. In blood we will study immune cell subsets and their activation status; autoantibody profiles; and epigenetic profiles. Synovial biopsies will allow us to examine the cell lineages present, including stromal cell subtypes, as well as inflammatory mediators. We will additionally examine metabolic profiles in blood, urine and synoivum. Using multivariate statistical techniques we will develop a model that predicts impending flare in RA, highlighting tractable therapeutic pathways and informative biomarkers.

Genetic factors play an important role in PDB and mutations in SQSTM1 gene are responsible for ~10% of PDB cases with high penetrance. We have recently identified seven additional susceptibility loci for PDB using genome-wide association studies (Albagha et al, 2011; Nat Genet). These recently identified loci have a combined effect that explained about 13% of familial risk suggesting that other genetic factors remain to be identified. The aims of this project are three fold: 1) to define the functional variants in the recently identified susceptibility loci using targeted DNA sequencing, 2) To identify novel genetic variants for disease susceptibility using exome sequencing in PDB patients without SQSTM1 mutations, 3) To investigate the role of epigenetic factors and their interaction with genetic factors in the pathogenesis of PDB. We will study genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in PDB patients and controls to identify differentially methylated sites associated with PDB. The contribution of epigenetic factors to the focal nature of PDB will be studied using an animal model of PDB to assess if epigenetic changes are specific to bone lesions and to determine if these changes contribute to disease development or occur as a consequence of the disease. Identification of genetic and epigenetic factors that predispose to PDB will increase our understanding of disease mechanisms and could also identify novel molecular pathways that could form targets for new therapeutic treatment not only for Paget's disease, but also other diseases associated with increased bone turnover. These factors could be used as markers for disease susceptibility to assess people at risk of developing PDB later in life and target those with the highest risk for early treatment.

124	Professor Austin Smith	University of Cambridge	None	2010-11-01	2015-10-31	The Road from Pluripotency to Lineage Determination.	Pluripotency is the capacity of individual cells to initiate all lineages of the mature organism in response to signals from the embryo or cell culture environment. Pluripotency has no predetermined programme; it is a tabula rasa. This is the foundation of mammalian development and of embryonic stem (ES) cell biology. Genetic and cell biological studies point to transcription factor command rather than epigenetic governance of the pluripotent state. Persuasive support for this view comes from th e demonstration that pluripotency can be recreated from somatic cells through transcription factor induced reprogramming. We now wish to investigate the other side of this coin; how pluripotent cells exit from a naive ground state and become committed to different lineages. Our hypothesis is that fibroblast growth factor stimulation of the mitogen activated protein kinase cascade perturbs the ground state and creates a metastable condition in which cells are poised for multilineage commitment. W e aim to isolate cells in this transition state and interrogate their regulatory circuitry at both population and single cell levels using quantitative transcriptomics, proteomics and biochemistry, complemented by genetic manipulation and live cell tracking. Through these studies we hope to deepen understanding of the underlying design principles of pluripotency lineage choice.	Wellcome Trust	Programme Grant	1736222.0	GBP

Although MD is currently controlled by the widespread use of live attenuated vaccines, continuing trend in increasing virulence is threatening the efficacy of the currently used vaccines. The overall strategic aim of this WP is to understand the molecular interactions and pathways used by oncogenic viruses in inducing neoplastic transformation to develop more efficient strategies of disease control. As part of this WP we will examine the molecular determinants of MDV associated with oncogenicity in natural infection models, using reverse genetics strategies on infectious BAC clones of MDV that we have developed at IAH. This will include the use of fluorescently tagged viruses and live cell imaging techniques to monitor the viral replication in vitro and in vivo, the use of recombinant viruses to identify the virus-host interaction in tumours of infected birds. In addition, we hope to exploit the various advances in post-genomic technologies to analyse the transcriptome-proteome, miRNA expression and the viral/host protein-protein interactions to take a whole systems approach to identify the molecular pathways of oncogenesis in MD. We also aim to examine the epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation and histone modifications in MD tumour-derived cell lines, as well as laser dissected tumour cells from primary tumours. We believe that these studies will enable better understanding not only on the intricate host-pathogen interactions of oncogenic viruses and molecular pathways of oncogenesis, but also in delivering novel molecularly-defined more effective vaccines. As part of the programme, we will also examine the unique virus-host interactions in the feather follicle of infected cells, the only site where a fully productive infection occurs resulting in the release of the virus into the environment.

This process generates "transgressive" traits that are outside the parental range. Transgressive phenotypes in hybrids may involve complementation of genetic differences between the two parents, heterozygous advantage, genetic rearrangements and, from our recent work, epigenetic effects associated with RNA silencing. TRIBE will investigate these effects using tomato for which there is a recently published full genome sequences and for which there are well characterised genetic resources based on hybrids between cultivated tomato and its wild relatives. We propose to map the genome and epigenome of F2-F4 generation hybrids between S. lycopersicum and its wild relative S. pennelli and, in parallel, to find out the level of expression of all genes including those producing small silencing RNAs. These data will provide the first systematic analysis of genomes, their expression and epigenetic modifications in the four post hybridisation generations. TRIBE will also explore details of epigenetic mechanisms associated with transgressive traits with a view to their enhancement or suppression to facilitate conventional plant breeding involving wide crosses between crops and their wild relatives. It will also explore the possibility that there is a legacy of epigenetic marks in tomato that have been induced by ancestral hybridisation events. The final outcome of TRIBE will be a test of the hypothesis that hybridisation is important in evolution because it allows not only the formation of new combinations of genes: it is also a process that induces new heritable variation via epigenetic and RNA silencing based mechanisms. It will generate information that will be central to the the exploitation of hybrids in breeding of crops.It will also generate new information about evolutionary mechanisms that can be integrated into our understanding of the tree of life.

The correct timing of this transition, flowering, is crucial for reproductive success so multiple environmental and endogenous signals are integrated to judge when to flower. The Dean laboratory is studying the importance of prolonged cold or winter for flowering, a process known as vernalization. The need for vernalization ensures plants overwinter vegetatively and flower in the favourable conditions of spring. Vernalization involves cold-induced and stable repression of a floral repressor, FLC by a Polycomb-mediated chromatin silencing mechanism. Unlike animals, the germ line in plant cells originates from somatic tissues of the flower so, after vernalization, FLC expression needs to be reset to ensure a vernalization requirement in the next generation. Recently, our lab in collaboration with others has shown using an FLC- GUS translational fusion that FLC levels are restored after vernalization, at different stages through male reproductive development and in early stages of embryo development. We have now used a Landsberg erecta line carrying an FLC- luciferase translational fusion to identify mutations disrupting the resetting of FLC expression. In this proposal we will utilize these mutations to further define the FLC reprogramming process, using two complementary approaches: (i) characterization of molecular signatures that define the resetting process; (ii) identification of factors that regulate or are directly involved in this process, to explore the molecular mechanisms involved. The results obtained from this work will help us to understand epigenetic reprogramming of Polycomb targets in plants and other organisms.

129	Professor Twell	University of Leicester	None	None	2014-01-01	Epigenetic control of the plant male gametophyte and germline	In animals, epigenetic machinery is essential for generating and maintaining the germline and germ cells. Angiosperms lack strict germlines but after meiosis form male and female haploid cell lines (the gametophytes) which generate sperms and eggs. Male gametophyte development involves a switch to a significantly different gene expression programme. While dramatic DNA methylation and chromatin changes occur on a global scale during gametophyte formation, data are sparse and conflicting concerning the small RNA (sRNA) pathways, which are so critical to epigenetic gene regulation in the sporophyte. We will determine the contribution of sRNA pathways to development of the male gametophyte and germline of Arabidopsis thaliana by inhibiting sRNA processing systems through expression of a range of viral suppressors of eukaryotic gene silencing systems. To identify which sRNA pathways are active during gametophyte and germline development we shall use microarrays and RTPCR to monitor expression of genes encoding key elements of the small RNA processing and RNA-dependent DNA methylation pathways, at different stages of development. We will then use artificial microRNA constructs, and (ii) RNA-dependent DNA methylation and transcriptional gene silencing, using hairpin constructs directed to non-endogenous promoter constructs to confirm that the different cell types of the gametophye and germline are capable of (i) mature microRNA biogenesis and microRNA- directed cleavage and/or translational inhibition transcripts. Finally we will explore the 'totality' of the impact of sRNA systems on gametophyte and germline development by determining - for the first time - the 'sRNA transcriptome' at three key developmental stages. Established bioinformatics approaches will be used to identify (i) genomic and mRNA targets of gametophytic/germline sRNAs, and (ii) trends in sRNA expression during development.

Nearly all common diseases and traits have now been found to be heritable and GWA studies are discovering many novel genes. However 95% of the heritability is not yet identified and discordances within identical (MZ) twin pairs cannot be explained by known environmental factors. The missing heritability could be due to epigenetic factors - which are ideally studied with twins. The proposed study uses MZ twins discordant for 10 important age-related complex disease traits to uncover epigenetic signals that are associated with disease. We will study in detail epigenetic differences using a high throughput Illumina methylation array in the 5% most discordant pairs for the following disease susceptibility traits : obesity (BMI), type II diabetes (insulin resistance) , hypertension (BP), hyperlipidemia (lipid levels), Osteoporosis (BMD), biological aging (white cell telomere levels), Allergy (IgE) , asthma (FEV1), platelet volume (MPV) and smoking. We will use the TwinsUK cohort of 3000 phenotyped MZ twins for a discovery group. For replication of the most significant associations we will use singletons from the 200 extreme highs and lows of the remaining 4000 phenotyped twins as a ?case'-?control ?association study genotyped by the same array. A sub-sample will be genotyped by sequencing. To assess tissue specificity, additional tissues for methylation analysis will be sampled (buccal, fat and skin DNA). Causality will be explored using bioinformatics, cell specificity experiments and longitudinal studies using DNA stored for upto 15 years- as well as parental and offspring DNA. Epigenetics is a major future growth area for genomics. This large scale study would enable us to maintain a European lead and act also a valuable future epidemiologic resource and enable important collaborations with other European researchers and cohorts.

This work aims to discover the molecular basis of nematode parasitism. Nematodes are common and important pathogens of humans. Anti-nematode therapy relies on a few drugs to which there is already resistance. Parasitic nematodes have evolved adaptations (e.g. altered metabolism, immune defence) to be successful parasites. While adaptations to animal parasitism is understood in these rather broad categories, the specific molecular bases of these adaptations is not known. A key question is, wh at molecules do parasitic nematodes use to be successful parasites? The genus Strongyloides spp. include important human parasites. There is also a well studied rodent model, S. ratti. Uniquely among parasitic nematodes, the Strongyloides life-cycle includes both a parasitic female stage and a genetically identical free-living female stage. Differences between these two female forms must be epigenetic, presumably controlled by altered transcription and translation. We will compare the proteom e and transcriptome of the parasitic and free-living females of S. ratti. From this we will define the genes and gene products of the parasitic female stage. This approach exploits the currently advanced S. ratti genome sequencing project. This work will give an understanding of the molecular basis of nematode parasitism, and so define new potential drug targets.	Wellcome Trust	Project Grant	272561.0	GBP

These sRNAs influence diverse aspects of growth and development by targeting RNA degradation or DNA methylation. The proposed work is based on the hypothesis that sRNA profiles (SIROtypes) are predictors of the genetic and epigenetic regulation of cells and of valuable traits in plant breeding. Preliminary work has established the potential for extensive variation in the SIROtypes that can be exploited in crop improvement. The sRNAs are derived from up to 5000 loci in the Arabidopsis genome and there is variation in the sRNA profile of closely related tomatoes or in Arabidopsis. High throughput sequencing will be used to characterize the sRNAs in tomato cultivars grown in various conditions including stress conditions. The different loci producing sRNAs or that are their potential targets will be identified by aligning the sequences of the sRNAs with genome sequence of the crop plants. Array technology will then be developed for profiling the sRNA in plant populations with polymorphic phenotypes. Statistical analysis will then be used to establish the correlation between the phenotypes and production of specific sRNAs. Array based SIROtyping will identify a subset of sRNA loci that are predictors of phenotypes. To validate the utility of this sRNA subset an RT-PCR method will be used for assay of the informative sRNA clusters in large populations. The proposed work will also evaluate the possibility that important agronomic traits can be modified when selected sRNAs are overexpressed or suppressed transgenically. These analyses and manipulations of sRNAs have the potential to establish a novel approach to crop improvement that is based on variation of regulatory RNAs rather than of protein coding genes.

HP1, which exists as three homodimeric isoforms (HP1alpha, beta, gamma), plays a critical role in constitutive heterochromatin, regulation of the expression of heterochromatic and euchromatic genes, and DNA repair. The monomer unit comprises a chromodomain (CD), a homologous chromoshadow domain (CSD), which dimerises, and a connecting hinge region of variable length. Most attention has focussed on binding of HP1 through its CD to the epigenetic mark H3K9Me, but this does not explain all aspec ts of HP1 binding to chromatin. We will focus mainly on two other regions in HP1 the CSD, which interacts with nucleosomal histone H3 at a second (occluded) site in a methylation-independent manner; and the hinge region, which interacts with DNA in vitro. Building on our preliminary work we will determine the structure of the HP1α CSD in complex with a peptide containing the second H3 site by NMR, and characterise the structure and the DNA-binding properties of the HP1 hinge region. We wi ll also study the interaction of full length HP1 with histones H3 and H1, and through a combination of biochemistry and novel NMR we will characterise the nature of HP1 binding to chromatin.

Arsenic trioxide therapy for Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia (APL) is mediated by SUMO-dependent degradation of Promyelocytic Leukaemia (PML)-Retinoic Acid Receptor a (RAR) oncogenic fusion protein. We demonstrated that ubiquitin mediated proteolysis of PML requires RNF4 E3 ubiquitin ligase. This allows terminal differentiation of tumour cells and cures disease. Our objective is to establish the molecular basis for the remarkable specificity of arsenic in APL and to determine if it can be employed therapeutically in other situations. Key questions to be addressed are: 1. How does arsenic "activate" PML. A YFP-PML expressing cell line will be used in a high content siRNA screen for gene products required for arsenic induced degradation of PML. Using TAP-tagged PML we will define post-translational modifications on PML induced by arsenic by time-resolved, SILAC based, mass spectrometry. Correlation between gene products required for arsenic induced degradation of PML and modifications that appear on PML in response to arsenic will allow us to elaborate the pathway of activation. 2. How does arsenic induce SUMO modification of PML. Proteomic analysis indicates that arsenic induced SUMO modification of PML is highly specific. Accounting for this we find that PML is a SUMO E3 ligase. The hypothesis we will test is that arsenic activates a SUMO E3 ligase activity of PML inducing an autoSUMOylation reaction. 3. What is the role of SUMO-PML in stem cell maintenance. PML plays a role in stem cell maintenance and its degradation, induced by arsenic, leads to stem cell differentiation. Thus arsenic treatment could induce differentiation of inherently resistant "cancer stem cells" into cells that are susceptible to chemotherapeutic drugs. We will test this and follow arsenic treatment with SUMO proteome analysis in human stem cells (collaboration Dr David Hay) and in RNF4-/- mouse ES cells. In an siRNA screen for SUMO-dependent transcriptional repressors, we identified many epigenetic regulators that are SUMO modified, contain SUMO interaction motifs and are important in stem cell maintenance. Our hypothesis is that this represents a SUMO-dependent transcriptional repression network, recruited onto promoters by SUMO modified transcription factors We will identify sites of modification and introduce forms that cannot be SUMO modified back into stem cells and assess endogenous gene expression and use ChIP analysis to monitor promoter occupancy, to establish SUMO dependence.

Histone phosphorylation is recognised to be an essential form of epigenetic regulation that can modulate chromosomal architecture and gene expression during interphase in response to physiological and environmental stimuli. However, the role and regulation of histone dephosphorylation is poorly understood. We have shown that loss of function of the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) or its nuclear targeting subunit PNUTS results in hyperphosphorylation of Histone H3 during interpha se in Drosophila, implicating PNUTS-PP1 as an important physiological regulator of this process. Since deregulated chromatin modification is associated with a variety of diseases, a better understanding of the role of histone phosphatases is of major scientific and medical importance. Here, I aim to firmly establish a role for PNUTS-PP1 in Histone H3 dephosphorylation, explore the effects of PNUTS-PP1 on chromosome architecture and gene expression, and investigate the mechanisms regulating the d istribution and therefore activity of the phosphatase on chromosomes. To do this, I propose to use a combination of advanced genetic, cell biological and molecular approaches in Drosophila, which offers many advantages for the study of the effects of chromatin modification in an animal model.

We have shown that mature sperm is 5 times better than spermatids in supporting Xenopus embryo development, illustrating the programming process associated with sperm maturation. We will use this unique system, where these two haploid cells exhibit different developmental potential, to reveal the nature of sperm programming. The deposition of epigenetic marks on paternal chromatin during sperm maturation will be analysed by ChIP-Seq on sperm and spermatid. Subsequently, we will compare the presence of these marks with the differential embryonic gene expression observed in sperm- and spermatid-derived embryos. Next, we will test what fraction of epigenetic marks present in the paternal nucleus is carried over to and propagated by the embryo. Ultimately, we will functionally test the role of gene marking in the sperm on the future embryonic gene expression and we will investigate what are the egg factors responsible for the recognition and maintenance of the paternally-inherited marks. Our results will provide functional evidence for paternal programming, and will also allow the generation of epigenetic maps of sperm/spermatids and corresponding embryos in Xenopus. We believe that the final outcome of our research - understanding the way the paternal nucleus is programmed, has the potential to improve several aspects of human health. First, knowing the epigenome of a cell that is efficiently reprogrammed by the egg will help the design of strategies altering the epigenome of a somatic cell in order to increase the efficiency of nuclear reprogramming. This would improve derivation of patient-specific cells for cell replacement therapies and drug screening. Second, our work will shed light on a recent area of research - the paternal inheritance of epigenetic features across generations, which is likely to influence the public health policy.

A key property of vernalization is the ability of the plants to 'remember' that they have experienced winter. The work in the Dean laboratory has shown that this memory is controlled by changes in the proteins (histones) associated with the DNA of a particular gene (FLC) encoding a repressor of flowering. These changes regulate the gene in a so-called 'epigenetic manner' that is they lock the expression state of the gene into the 'off state' so in the absence of the cold signal the gene still stays off. Two of the recently cloned VRN genes (VIN3/VRN7 and VRN5) encode proteins with domains that might act as receptors for signalling molecules. This grant will analyse how the proteins from these two genes work together in the plant to control levels of the important floral repressor, FLC and mediate the vernalization response. This work will provide information on the regulation of genes in response to environmental signals that may be generally relevant to both plant and animal biologists and provide information and materials to potentially manipulate flowering time and vernalization response in a range of crops.

139	Prof Dame Caroline Dean	John Innes Centre	None	None	2015-09-30	Molecular analysis of the natural variation in vernalization response of Arabidopsis accessions	The model plant A. thaliana shows a wide range of genetic and phenotypic variation among natural accessions. Notably, adaptation of flowering time to specific environmental conditions is essential for reproductive success. This proposal will use our knowledge of the molecular basis of vernalization to uncover how Arabidopsis thaliana accessions have adapted to their environment. Analysis of flowering time and vernalization in Arabidopsis accessions provides a unique opportunity to link mechanistic understanding of a complex trait with an understanding of the fitness consequences of different alleles and their distribution within the population. The specific aims of this project will be 1) to fully define the molecular variation at FLC and linked genes underpinning the natural variation in accessions selected to represent a wide range of vernalization responses and 2) use the different accessions as a pool of 'natural mutants' to gain a better understanding of the basis of FLC regulation during vernalization. We will first confirm that FLC cis- elements are involved in this variation by a complementation analysis, followed by mix and match experiments to determine which region contains the cis-regulatory elements that account for the variation. We will also analyse the epigenetic changes at the FLC locus which result from the polymorphisms in the ciselements, as well as the role of other chromosome 5 candidates identified in a QTL analysis for the variation in vernalization response. In parallel, we will characterize important cis-elements in FLC required to initiate and maintain FLC repression during and after vernalization. We will then pick natural variants with polymorphisms in these cis-elements. Dissecting the molecular basis of adaptation is a major goal in evolutionary genetics and the results from this study are likely to provide important insights into adaptation relevant to many biological systems.

The correct timing of this transition, flowering, is crucial for reproductive success so multiple environmental and endogenous signals are integrated to judge when to flower. The Dean laboratory is studying the importance of prolonged cold or winter for flowering, a process known as vernalization. The need for vernalization ensures plants overwinter vegetatively and flower in the favourable conditions of spring. Vernalization involves cold-induced and stable repression of a floral repressor, FLC by a Polycomb-mediated chromatin silencing mechanism. Unlike animals, the germ line in plant cells originates from somatic tissues of the flower so, after vernalization, FLC expression needs to be reset to ensure a vernalization requirement in the next generation. Recently, our lab in collaboration with others has shown using an FLC- GUS translational fusion that FLC levels are restored after vernalization, at different stages through male reproductive development and in early stages of embryo development. We have now used a Landsberg erecta line carrying an FLCluciferase translational fusion to identify mutations disrupting the resetting of FLC expression. In this proposal we will utilize these mutations to further define the FLC reprogramming process, using two complementary approaches: (i) characterization of molecular signatures that define the resetting process; (ii) identification of factors that regulate or are directly involved in this process, to explore the molecular mechanisms involved. The results obtained from this work will help us to understand epigenetic reprogramming of Polycomb targets in plants and other organisms.

Advances in understanding the detailed mechanisms of epialleles formation in response to environmental cues and their heritable maintenance in a model plant such as Arabidopsis will be the starting objective of the AENEAS proposal. To this end, we will focus on three epigenetic regulatory pathways, which have been well characterized for their interaction with environmental signals in mediating changes into the epigenome. They are: the autonomous, the small RNA and the CpG methylation pathways. The outcome of this research activity will be a road map for plant environmental epigenetics, necessary for further progress of the basic research in this area and for the transfer of the knowledge to crop plants. Concomitantly, the constitution of an 'Environmental Epigenetics platform' for maize, will start with the development of tools indispensable for the shift of epigenetic research from Arabidopsis to maize. This will be achieved by the functional characterization of maize mutants for epi-regulators belonging to the three pathways studied in Arabidopsis. The tools will comprise: maize epi-regulator mutants, their targets, and information about their interaction with environmental cues for epialleles formation and inheritance throughout generations. It is our opinion that the deliverables from AENEAS will be the 'progenitors' for the next-generation of breeding programs, based on the exploitation of the environmental-induced epigenetics variability. In addition, we will conduct a comparative genomics analysis of data arising from the project to generate comparative models for environmental epigenomics in two evolutionary distinct species such as Arabidopsis and maize.

Abnormal epigenetic patterns, including of histone-methylation, are implicated in cancer onset and progression, and small-molecules targeting chromatin regulators have been introduced for cancer therapies. N-Methylation of lysine- and arginine- residues on histone tails is an important mechanism of transcriptional regulation. Such methylation catalysed by methyltransferases (KMTs) and reversed by demethylases (KDMs). Dysregulation of some KDMs is strongly linked to cancer and some KDMs are current therapeutic targets. However, despite the emerging pathophysiological importance of KDMs, the biologically relevant substrate selectivity and the roles of most KDMs are far from clear. The largest KDM family are the JmjC enzymes which are Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate dependent oxygenases. Extensive preliminary results reveal JmjC members have demethylase or hydroxylase activities and that some act on non-histone substrates. Aims We aim to carry out comprehensive functional assignments of human members of JmjC family of demethylases / hydroxylases, at biochemical and cellular levels, that will enable their roles in cancer to be placed on a sound molecular basis. Methods We will establish the substrate selectivity of recombinant human JmjC enzymes using appropriate substrates including histone peptides, full-length histones and intact appropriately modified nucleosomes; non-histone substrates will also be explored. The roles of the catalytic and non-catalytic domains will be systematically established. Alternative potential substrates/binding partners will also be investigated using techniques validated for oxygenase substrate discovery, including RNA and phage display. The structural basis of selectivity will be explored using biophysical techniques including crystallography, NMR and mass spectrometry. Parallel work in cells, including using mass spectrometric methodologies, will be used both to identify JmjC substrates (including non-histone substrates) and validate predictions regarding selectivity following from work with isolated proteins. We will work with an extensive network of collaborators to disseminate the results for use in inhibition studies aimed at validating JmjC enzymes as cancer targets. How the results of this research will be used The functional assignment results will be used both by the large research communities working on relationships between altered mechanisms of epigenetic regulation and cancer. They will also be enabling for the academic and pharmaceutical scientists pursuing KDMs as cancer targets– an understanding of function is essential both for establishing optimal screens and in interpreting the results of inhibitors in cells and animal models/clinical trials.

143	Professor Helen Picton	University of Leeds	Lds Inst Genetics Health & Therapeutics	2008-09-01	2012-08-31	Biological foundation for epigenetic investigations of ART derived human oocytes and embryos	Imprinted genes are expressed predominantly or exclusively from one parental allele. This mode of regulation is uniquely sensitive to disruption, and therefore imprinted genes themselves are cellular biomarkers of epigenetic disruption, cellular stress and cancer. In assisted reproductive technology (ART) in humans, gametes and embryos are manipulated in vitro at the exact time when the complex and delicate processes of epigenetic reprogramming occur. Recent evidence suggests a range of epigenetic mutations leading to diseases such as Angelman syndrome and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have arisen in children born following assisted conception. Although some of these of imprinting defects may be caused by infertility itself, experimental evidence also indicates that ARTs can disrupt epigenetic mechanisms and alter the regulation of imprinted genes. The need to directly quantify the epigenetic consequences of ART and infertility on the health of the human preimplantation embryos is therefore becoming increasingly important. Due to the limited availability of human gametes and embryos for research and the requirement for analytical methods which are sensitive at the single oocyte/embryo level, the epigenetic processes that regulate early human development remain largely unknown. Despite these limitations we established a programme to investigate early epigenetic processes in humans and have developed appropriate tools and techniques to permit studies of oogenesis and embryogenesis. This project therefore aims to conduct a robust series of investigations of the imprinted genes in human oocytes and preimplantation embryos and to relate these observations to the epigenetic health of embryos derived following ART. This application will test the hypothesis that disruption of imprinting attributable to in vitro manipulations of human gametes and embryos will result in aberrant expression of imprinted genes in the preimplantation embryos so produced. Specifically this application will: 1) establish whether the imprinted genes and epigenetic regulators serve as biomarkers of epigenetic disruption in human blastocysts derived by conventional ART including IVF, ICSI and the in vitro maturation (IVM) of oocytes; 2) monitor allelic expression of imprinted gene transcripts in blastocysts to determine whether expression is monoallelic or otherwise; 3) use bisulphite genomic sequencing to analyse methylation imprints in human ART-derived oocytes and embryos; and 4) conduct a detailed analysis of imprinted gene expression and methylation in a cohort of IVM blastocysts. The data generated will significantly advance our knowledge of the mechanism(s) behind ART-induced imprinting defects in human oocytes and embryos and will help us understand how to alleviate these problems in the future.

Calcification is caused by vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) dysfunction and is accelerated by premature VSMC ageing, driven by accumulation of the toxic nuclear protein prelamin A. Prelamin A accumulation in VSMCs in vivo induced aortic dilatation, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, calcification, systolic hypertension and premature death. At the molecular level these pathologies were preceded by distinct temporal events including epigenetic modifications, DNA damage, premature senescence and upregulation of the osteo/chondrogenic transcription factors Sox9 and Runx2. Multiple-Omics analyses identified stepwise changes in signaling and ECM production correlating with the progression of ageing phenotypes. Next, using in vitro and in vivo models, and human biobank samples, we will systemically test how pharmacological and genetic interference with these pathways can delay vascular ageing and examine new mechanisms of calcification to define novel targets for therapeutic intervention in man.

We have shown that induction of an altered metabolic phenotype in the offspring of rats fed a protein-restricted (PR) diet during pregnancy involves hypomethylation of specific gene promoters by a mechanism in which lower expression and binding activity of DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt)-1s has a central role. These effects were prevented by increasing the folic acid content of the PR diet. We are the first to show that induction of hypomethylation of the hepatic glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and PPARa in the F1 offspring by feeding a PR diet to F0 dams was transmitted to the F2 offspring through the female line even though F1 females received adequate nutrition. This study will investigate how changes in the epigenetic regulation of genes and altered metabolic phenotype are transmitted between generations. We will test the overall hypothesis that altered epigenetic regulation of Dnmt1s is transmitted between generations and that in each generation promoter methylation of specific genes is established by the activities of other Dnmts in oocytes and early embryos, but is lost during subsequent development due to lower Dnmt1s activity. We will use the well-established rat model of feeding a PR diet during pregnancy to investigate the epigenetic regulation of Dnmts by DNA methylation in oocytes and liver in three generations of offspring. Epigenotype and metabolic phenotype will be assessed in each generation by the methylation status and expression of hepatic GR and PPARa, expression of target genes and by markers of gluconeogenesis and fatty acid beta-oxidation. We will also determine whether increasing maternal folic acid intake during pregnancy interrupts transmission of altered epigenetic regulation and thus of adverse phenotypes between generations.

147	Professor John Mathers	Newcastle University	None	None	2011-06-15	DNA Methylation, Developmental Programming and Cellular Memory: The Molecular Consequences of Folate Depletion In Utero	An accumulating body of evidence supports the premise that nutritional deprivation in utero has lifelong consequences for health, including a predisposition to obesity, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, particularly in association with a plentiful food supply post-weaning. Thus, it is presumed that nutritional status in utero is recorded and remembered in a manner that programmes the foetus to use nutrients in a way that improves survival when the nutrient supply is poor but to be adapted inappropriately to a plentiful or excessive intake. Epigenetic processes, including DNA methylation, provide a compelling mechanism for such effects, manifest through influences on gene expression. Our preliminary data reveal that folate depletion in utero in the mouse did not affect weight at weaning but increased the weight of offspring at 100 d and induced global DNA hypomethylation in liver and affected expression of multiple genes in foetal liver. These observations provide the impetus to examine in detail the influence of this nutritional stress on adiposity and on the methylation and expression of specific genes. Our hypotheses are that i) folate depletion in utero predisposes mice to increased weight and abdominal adiposity in adulthood, exacerbated by a high-fat post- weaning diet and ii) the effect is mediated through the methylation of specific genes, which affects expression through transcription factor binding. These hypotheses will be investigated through measuring the effect of folate depletion in utero in mice, followed by a control or high-fat post-weaning diet, on weight gain and adiposity and by examining effects at late gestation on DNA methylation in liver, using a microarray-based approach, and on gene expression and DNA methylation at 180 d. Effects of promoter methylation on gene expression and transcription factor binding will be investigated for selected differentially methylated and expressed genes using in vitro molecular approaches.

The addition of transgenes that show homology to endogenous genes by definition increases their abundance but can also result in down-regulation of gene expression and hypermethylation of one or both sequences. Homology dependent gene silencing (HDG silencing) is a cover-all term for silencing interactions between homologous sequences around the genome. Hairpin constructs are designed to contain inverted repeats homologous to part of cellular genes. They produce double stranded RNA that is degraded to short interfering (siRNA) and targets degradation of the corresponding mRNA and post- transcriptional gene silencing. They also target cytosine methylation to homologous sequences. In contrast multi-copy methylated sense gene constructs can also result in HDG silencing but the mechanism is less clear and may require methylation of the transgene and or cellular gene to work. The CH-42 gene codes for a magnesium chelatase subunit involved in the biosynthesis of chlorophyll. HDG silencing of CH-42 result in yellow plants. Transgenic Arabidopsis lines containing hairpin constructs targeted to the 3 prime end of CH-42 and multi-copy methylated inserts containing the whole of CH-42 have been studied. The hairpin line (bobby insert) shows straightforward genetics and the genetics of the multi- copy methylated line (goldenheart insert) is complex. Both inserts are highly methylated. Crosses of the insert lines to methylation mutants and silencing mutant revealed that goldenheart silencing depends on DNA methylation. In this project the pattern of DNA methylation in the transgenes and the endogenous genes will be analysed at the nucleotide level using genomic sequencing of bisulphite treated DNA. This will be correlated with siRNA species and the abundance of degraded and intact CH-42 mRNA in the lines. This will be repeated in a variety of methylation mutant background in order to assess the roles of different genes in the de novo and maintenance methylation in the insert background and after the inserts have been segregated away. The results from the current study of the bobby insert suggests that it is very effective at generating hypermethylation at the 3 prime end of the CH-42 gene but that such insert free plants are aphenotypic and wild type green in phenotype. Hairpin constructs directed to the CH-42 promoter will be used to attempt to methylate the promoter of the endogenous gene. This may result in epigenetic variants with a pale or yellow phenotype due to transcriptional gene silencing by methylation. The inheritance of any such traits will be studied. The HOG1 gene is involved in the degradation of an inhibitor of DNA methylation and MET1 codes for the major DNA methylase. Point mutants in these genes often result in genome-wide DNA demthylation. T-DNA tags in the HOG1 and MET1 genes have a zygotic lethal phenotype and it may be that extreme hypomethylation of the arabidopsis genome is incompatible with normal zygotic development. It would be practically convenient and might be useful to circumvent the lethality and generate a system of controlled hypomethylation. This will be attempted using hairpin constructs directed against MET1 and HOG1 driven by an inducible promoter. Green plants derived from out crosses of plants containing the bobby insert typically show extensive hypermethylation of the 3 prime end of the CH-42 locus, presumably due to RNA directed de novo DNA methylation in the presence of the bobby insert followed by maintenance methylation after the insert is crossed away. Such lines present an opportunity to study the inheritance of the methylated state in wild type and methylation mutant backgrounds. In self-fertilised and outcrossed plants and to answer general questions about the genetics of methylation. In the current study a transcriptome analysis has identified over 200 transcripts that are up-regulated in the hog1- 1(point) mutant. To continue and expand this study the same transcripts will be analysed in a large number of mutant backgrounds using real-time reverse transcriptase PCR to quantify transcript levels. This should allow precise and quantitative comparisons across a broad range of DNA methylation, chromatin structure and gene silencing mutants.

Our laboratory focuses on non-canonical four-stranded DNA structures called G-quadruplexes (G4s) in the genome. This structural motif is implicated in cancer biology and is a potential molecular target for therapeutics. Aims We will explore the chemical perturbation of genome function using small molecules with the aim of understanding the importance of G4s to cancer biology. The programme consists of three closely related areas: -G-quadruplexes and transcription. Evaluation of mechanistic details of refined G4 ligands in cancer gene transcription and the elucidation of ligand selectivity and the potential to inhibit cancer cell growth. -G-quadruplexes and genome instability. Exploiting synergies with known cancer-related genetic backgrounds and the discovery and characterisation of new synergies using optimised ligands. -Drug-DNA interactions in the genome. Synthesis and optimisation of the mapping of cisplatin analogue binding sites in DNA and their association with epigenetic changes in cisplatin-sensitive and resistant ovarian cancer cells. We will also map the binding of G4 ligands to the genome. Methods We will create new ways to apply the principles of molecular biophysics and chemical biology on a genome scale towards the basic mechanistic understanding of nucleic acid function. Using chemistry and genomics, we will also develop new methodologies to better appreciate drug-DNA interactions within a cellular context. We will adopt an integrated, interdisciplinary approach that focuses on our core strengths: molecular biophysics, small molecule-DNA interactions and chemical biology. How results of this research will be used Our results will provide fundamental insights into the importance of DNA secondary structures in genome function and for cancer biology. Our chemical biological studies explore mechanisms that will ultimately lead to the identification of new cancer pathways. Our research will be augmented by close collaborations involving structural biology, cell biology, genomics and bioinformatics in our sister laboratory at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute (CRUK CI), and with established partnerships with international leaders. Although this programme is centred on fundamental studies any novel methods or compounds with interesting biological activity will be considered for possible further development with guidance from CRT and Cambridge Enterprise. Any translational opportunities will be developed with expertise from our clinical collaborators Carlos Caldas, James Brenton and Duncan Jodrell at the CRUK CI.

150	Professor Ernest Laue	University of Cambridge	None	None	None	Structure and function of SRA domains implicated in chromatin regulation	Formation of chromatin structure is central to the control of gene expression in eukaryotic cells. Heterochromatin is defined as that structurally and biochemically distinct fraction of the genome that remains condensed throughout the mitotic cell cycle. There is a great deal of evidence to indicate that the structural organisation of heterochromatin is determined at the time of replication, in mid-late S phase, and that associated multi-protein complexes are required to enable the stable epigenetic inheritance of a heterochromatic state that is required for transcriptional silencing, sister-chromatid cohesion and kinetochore function. DNA methylation plays an important role in gene silencing and genomic imprinting. Methylated DNA-binding proteins (like MeCP2) provide a connection between DNA methylation and transcriptional silencing. The accepted paradigm for transcriptional repression by MeCP2 involves formation of a co-repressor complex (involving MeCP2, Sin3a and HDAC1), that targets particular promoters and inactivates gene expression. MeCP2, however, is a potent chromatin- condensing protein that mediates the assembly of novel chromatin structures and it is highly concentrated in mouse heterochromatin in vivo. These highly methylated, condensed and repressed heterochromatic domains, rich in MeCP2, are present in constitutive heterochromatin as well as being interspersed with relatively decondensed euchromatic and transcriptionally active regions. MeCP2 could, therefore, play an important role in the organisation and stability of chromatin structures that are set up during heterochromatin replication. Np95 is an essential S phase and novel chromatin binding protein that directly interacts with histones (H3 greater than greater than H1 greater than H2B) both in vivo and in vitro. Functional ablation of Np95 by RNAi experiments shows that this protein is essential for heterochromatin replication. Double immunostaining for Np95 and chromatin-bound PCNA, a marker of sites of DNA replication, revealed that Np95 almost exclusively co- localizes with chromatin-bound PCNA throughout the nucleus in early S phase (during euchromatin replication), but only partly in mid-S phase (during replication of pericentric heterochromatin). Unlike PCNA, Np95 does not seem to be directly involved in DNA replication as part of the DNA synthesizing machinery, but it is presumably involved in other DNA replication-linked nuclear events. Our preliminary experiments indicate that Np95 and MeCP2 interact with each other both in vitro and in vivo, and that Np95 is by itself unable to bind methylated DNA. This suggests that MeCP2 might recruit Np95 to modified DNA to stabilize the nucleoprotein complexes formed by the methyl-binding protein. We hypothesise that Np95 and MeCP2 are partners in multi- protein complexes that are required for large-scale chromatin condensation, transcriptional silencing of both constitutive and facultative heterochromatin and the stable inheritance of heterochromatic domains, which are established and propagated during DNA replication. The aim of this project is to study protein complexes involving MeCP2 and Np95 that are implicated in the structural organisation of heterochromatin. Our preliminary data shows that SRA domain within Np95 is essential for the Np95-MeCP2 interaction and the interaction of Np95 with histones. Our effort, therefore, will concentrate on the role of this domain in the complex and in chromatin structure. In summary, our objectives are to: 1. Solve the 3D structure of the SRA domain, 2. Investigate the SRA domain interaction with MeCP2, 3. Identify and study other SRA domain interactions, and 4. Study the role of MeCP2/SRA-domain interactions on the structure of heterochromatin during DNA replication and differentiation.

In this way PSCP will establish a leading position in the field of stem cell product development for clinical trials and its potential for industrialisation. PSCP will concentrate in-house activities on PSC and derivative tissue stem cell intermediates. However, the field in general will also benefit from tackling key knowledge gaps including: (i) establishment of standardised systems for generation of robust genetically stable human PSC populations suitable for therapeutic translation, (ii) development of genetic modification tools that bypass the risk of insertional mutagenesis and are subject to science based risk assessment, (iii) development of effective, reliable and reproducible differentiation protocols yielding functional, clinically compliant tissue-specific donor cells, (iv) quality control systems suitable for consistent manufacturing of stem cells and differentiated progeny suitable for use in human applications. The PSCP programme will address these issues through the following workpackages: i) Methods for iPSC production for clinical applications; ii) Development of a GMP-ready PSC expansion platform; iii) Assessment of the genomic and epigenomic integrity; iv) Development of protocols for production of neural progenitors; v) Development of protocols for production of endoderm lineages; vi) Product and process evaluation - integration of biology with process engineering and manufacture; vii) Safety qualification of PSC for clinical application.; viii) Process development for viable and cost-effective GMP of exemplars,notably dopaminergic and otic neurons; ix) Reproducibility and comparability.

This is of grave concern as obesity during pregnancy has immediate detrimental effects on maternal and fetal health as well as increasing the long-term risk of cardio-metabolic disease in the offspring. Using a mouse model of maternal diet-induced obesity we demonstrated a causal relationship between maternal obesity with pathological cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac dysfunction and hypertension in the adult offspring. Understanding the mechanisms by which this occurs is essential if rational intervention strategies are to be designed and implemented. Adopting an integrative approach, combining in vivo experiments in a mouse model with those at the cellular, molecular and epigenetic levels, this programme addresses the roles of maternal hyperinsulinaemia, hypoxia and dysregulation of cardiac miRNA expression in the offspring as important underlying molecular mechanisms.

However, the regenerative medicine community currently lacks affordable and scalable systems. This bottleneck for translational programmes requires novel solutions as a matter of urgency, with the availability of clinical grade human embryonic stem cell, and in the near future human induced pluripotent stem cell lines. The overarching goal of this proposal is the development and qualification of a novel system for the automated scale up of hPSCs invented by Tokyo Electron (EU base in Stevenage), for subsequent differentiation into therapeutically valuable lineages. The novel, entirely enclosed, automated culture system suitable for next generation stem cell therapy manufacturing will use non-invasive image evaluation and non invasive biochemical/genetic monitoring to allow evaluation of cell health and phenotype during cell expansion. Thus, only healthy cells can be selected for continued culture or entry into therapeutic differentiation protocols. In this proposal we will develop the metrics to ensure optimal conditions for stable expanded hPSC culture, including growth rates/phenotype and karyotypic/epigenetic normality. Deep phenotyping will include cell morphology via refinement of computer algorithms, genetic (e.g.CGH array) and epigenetic profiling and both discovery and targeted secretome metabolite/proteome analysis. Pluripotency will be assured via development of high throughput novel differentiation marker analysis replacing teratoma formation. We will generate new biomarkers based on culture medium analysis (secretome, biosensor data) to refine culture conditions and generate new media/substrate combinations. We will deliver online/Cloud-based metrics analysis tools available to UK/ other stem cell communities adaptable for other scale up applications.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	1289418.0	GBP
154	Dr Paul Badenhorst	University of Birmingham	None	None	2017-09-30	Identifying the gene targets and mechanisms of recruitment of the nucleosome remodelling factor (NURF)	In the cell nucleus, DNA does not occur in a free state, but exists as a nucleoprotein complex, chromatin. The association of DNA with histones to form the nucleosomes that constitute chromatin has important consequences on gene expression. This is so, because these histone-DNA interactions can block gene regulatory elements and inhibit access of the transcription machinery. As such, chromatin offers an additional, epigenetic, way of coding information in the genome. Without varying the underlying DNA content, changes in nucleosome positioning and structure can alter the way gene expression is controlled. The objective of the current proposal is to determine how such changes in chromatin conformation influence transcription and ultimately cell fate decision. We will focus on an enzyme that has been shown to be able to alter nucleosome position, the Drosophila nucleosome remodelling factor (NURF). NURF is a member of the ATP- dependent family of chromatin remodelling factors. These are large multi-subunit protein complexes that use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to change nucleosome structure and/or position. NURF is composed of four protein subunits, all of which are conserved amongst higher eukaryotes, suggesting that NURF complexes are present in all higher eukaryotes. To date, human and Drosophila NURF have been purified and shown to have identical biochemical properties. Both Drosophila and human NURF catalyse energy-dependent neucleosome sliding. By sliding neucleosomes, NURF has the potential to expose or occlude transcription factor binding sites, and thus regulate the binding of transcription factors, and transcription. To date most research on chromatin remodelling factors has focused on the biochemical properties of these enzymes. However, it is essential that we understand the in vivo biological functions of these enzymes. In this proposal we will examine how NURF- induced nucleosome sliding is used to control transcription in Drosophila blood cells. We have focused our research on blood cells, given the phenotypes of mutants that lack Drosophila NURF. In previous work we generated mutations in the large NURF-specific subunit of Drosophila NURF, NURF301. In these mutants, blood development is perturbed, leading to a syndrome that resembles mammalian leukaemias. Here we will extend these results and define the precise function of NURF during Drosophila blood cell development. This includes identifying target genes of Drosophila NURF and the mechanisms by which NURF is recruited to these targets in blood cells. The proposed research will comprise three elements. First we will identify transcriptional targets of Drosophila NURF in blood tissues by Affymetrix microarray profiling. Affymetrix Drosophila genome 2 microarrays will be used to compare expression of all Drosophila genes in blood cells isolated from wild-type and NURF301 mutant animals. In the second phase of the project, we will use chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to determine which genes that show altered expression in NURF mutants are direct targets of NURF. We will raise antibodies against NURF subunits and use chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to immunoprecipitate NURF and associated target DNA from isolated blood cells. Finally, transcription factors and domains of NURF that are required to recruit the complex to target genes will be identified). Data from yeast and mammalian systems indicate that chromatin remodelling enzymes are directly recruited to target genes through interactions with DNA-binding transcription factors. We will use a yeast two-hybrid interaction screen to identify transcription factors that can interact with NURF subunits and recruit NURF gene targets. Given the conservation of Drosophila and human NURF, this information will be used to understand the functions of the corresponding human complex and its potential involvement in syndromes of disordered gene regulation such as leukaemias and cancers.

Specifically, we will determine how two histone modification-targeting domains (PHD and bromodomains) contribute to the function of the conserved ATP-dependent chromatin enzyme NURF. Ablation of Drosophila NURF has been shown to lead to formation of blood tumours. In this project we will: (i). Generate Drosophila NURF mutants lacking histone-targeting domains and determine the contribution of these motifs to blood tumour production, (ii) Perform microarray analysis of these mutants to determine gene targets that require histone modification for recruitment of NURF, (iii) Generate transgenic Drosophila strains that express epitope-tagged variants of NURF (containing or lacking histone-targeting domains), (iv) Determine the global distribution of NURF complexes that contain or lack these domains by chromatin immunopreciptitation followed by hybridization to whole genome tiling-path arrays (ChIP-on-chip). This research will provide insight into the complex interplay between the two principal mechanisms of coding epigenetic information in the nucleus - histone modifications and ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling - and will reveal their contributions to blood tumour production in flies. As NURF is conserved in all higher eukaryotes, information obtained using Drosophila should be directly applicable to humans.	Cancer Research UK	Studentship	None	None

The nuclear receptor superfamily binds a range of lipophillic micro and macro nutrients and thereby regulates a range of gene targets associated with proliferation and differentiation. Central to these actions is the association of nuclear receptors with other proteins in large complexes which can locally remodel chromatin around the promoter regions where these complexes bind. The expression and co-localisation of co-repressor components in these complexes are central to determining the ability to remodel chromation and thus regulate target genes. Recently it has become apparent that the overt nutrient sensing capacity of nuclear receptors operates not only in the gut but elsewhere in the body. One such site is the prostate gland which expresses a broad cohort of dietary sensing nuclear receptors. Understanding the co-ordinate expression and responses of this family, combined with its epigenetic and transcriptional actions is central to developing an integrative and predicative model of nutrient sensing of nuclear receptors. Relevance to Diet and Health Theme: The current proposal will establish the dynamic expression profiles to key dietary sensing nuclear receptors and associated co-factors in a range of normal cell line and primary culture models of prostate epithelial cells. Mechanistic approaches will focus on the interaction of one such receptor, the vitamin D receptor, with target gene promoters in response to micro and macro nutrient ligands. The goal is to generate an integrative model that describes how the vitamin D receptor interacts with ligand, co-factors, other dietary and adjacent transcription factors to regulate the specific and spatio-temporal regulation of epigenetic modifications on target gene promoters and co-ordinate gene transcription. This is essential to generating a mechanistic understanding of gene-nutrient interactions. Outline of research objectives: This project unites three international centre of excellence in a novel to configuration to; i. Define mRNA expression using high throughput Q-RT-PCR screening and cellular response signatures of key receptors in non-malignant cell line and primary prostate models. ii. Establish the vitamin D receptor as a model of micro and macro nutrient sensing, to reveal the critical interactions of receptor with co-repressor complexes, sodium butyrate and adjacent transcription factors (eg. p53) on target gene promoters. Interventionist siRNA and transfection approaches will generate a model of transcriptional responses in non- malignant cell line and primary prostate models. iii. Reveal to what extent epigenetic modifications around the binding sites for the vitamin D receptor on target gene promoters (eg. p21 (waf1 cip1)) correlate with the transcriptional responses. This will contribute to the understanding of the histone code and establish in what way it predicts and accounts for promoter responsiveness.

For example, soil and ground water contamination occur in many regions of the world and have a negative imp[act on plant growth and productivity. Plants cannot move and escape from the polluted areas and their ability to survive depends upon adaptation to the altered environment. One of the most extreme examples of industrial pollution relates to the Chernobyl disaster. Despite of the impact of radiation, active vegetation in the Chernobyl area during the recent years proves that plants can adapt to chronic radiation. Adaptation is a complex process by which populations of organisms respond to long-term environmental stresses by permanent genetic or epigenetic changes. It is necessary to understand the basic principles of plant protective mechanisms and how the stability of plant genome is preserved in the polluted areas. Therefore, we suggest that molecular studies under physiological conditions will help to understand better how cell cycle regulation and the epigenetic changes of DNA are coordinated with plant cell division and differentiation. Investigations of plant cell cycle regulation and related epigenetic DNA changes in selected species of plant from different regions around Chernobyl should help to determine the mechanism of DNA tolerance to the radioactive environment.

159	Dr Alison Brewer	King's College London	Dept of Cardiology	None	2010-06-08	Investigation of the redox-dependent regulation of the vascular angiogenic response following ischemia	The pro-angiogenic properties of the gasotransmitters, H2S, CO and NO are well known. Due to their high reactivity they must be synthesised close to their site of action as needed and so the expression and activities of their biosynthetic enzymes must be tightly controlled. Our studies have identified molecular pathways that link Nox4-dependent redox signalling to increased expression of both cystathionine-g-lyase (CSE) and Haem Oxygenase-1 (HO-1; which generate H2S and CO respectively). The transcription factors which mediate this redox-dependent upregulation are ATF4 (for CSE) and Nrf2 (for HO-1). Nox4 expression is known to increase in response to hypoxia, as occurs in ischemia, and its endothelial-specific overexpression is known to be beneficial in the angiogenic response to ischemia. We aim to determine whether these two pathways (ATF4/CSE/H2S, and Nrf2/HO-1/CO) mediate the Nox4-dependent angiogenic response in a model of hind limb ischaemia. We will also investigate mechanisms underlying the upregulation of Nox4 in response to hypoxia. Compelling evidence suggests epigenetic mechanisms, orchestrated by E2F and/or HIF may mediate this regulation. We thus aim to elucidate molecular pathways that link hypoxia, resulting from ischemia, to specific redox-dependent signalling pathways, which promote production of pro-angiogenic gasotransmitters; H2S and CO in endothelial cells. Understanding these pathways may inform future therapeutic strategies to promote angiogenesis.	British Heart Foundation	Project Grant	204346.0	GBP

Endothelial dysfunction(ED), characterised by blunted endothelial homeostatic responses, represents an early step in this pathogenesis. Evidence suggests that HG is causal in the development of ED and involves epigenetic changes, including changes in the methylation status of the genome. Intriguingly, HG is sufficient to induce changes in DNA methylation and associated gene transcription in endothelial cells in vitro. DNA methylation is regulated by the opposing actions of DNA-Methyl-Transferases, and Ten-Eleven-Translocation Enzymes(TETs), which convert 5-Methyl-Cytosine(5mC) to successive oxidised variants, to facilitate its removal and replacement by unmethylated cytosine. TETs are members of the 2-oxyglutarate(2OG)-dependent, Fe2+-dependent dioxygenase (2OGD) family of enzymes. Their activities are therefore regulated by metabolism and cellular redox, both of which are altered by HG. We aim to determine whether dysregulated TET function is causal in the development of ED upon HG exposure. In addition, administration of ascorbic acid(AA), a proven enhancer of 2OGD activity, is protective against HG-associated ED in vivo. We propose to determine whether TET(s) are a target of AA’s pharmacological action in this clinical setting, in order to inform future therapeutic strategies to prevent vascular disorder in DM.

Our overarching hypothesis is that diabetes reduces the regenerative potential by affecting PC in the bone marrow (BM) niche. We showed that microangiopathy affects the BM of diabetic animals, creating a harsh microenvironment incompatible with PC homeostasis. We now propose that another common complication, e.g. sensory neuropathy, impinges on BM homeostasis and compromises the egression of regenerative PC upon ischaemia. Although it is known that diabetic patients suffer silent ischemia, due to altered heart innervation, the possibility that sensory neuropathy extends to BM was not investigated. Pilot data indicate that sensory fibres are present in BM together with PC that express neuropeptide receptors. Exposure to neuropeptides enhances PC motility and allows isolation of PC endowed of potent proangiogenic activity. Furthermore, this sub-fraction is enriched within the cell population mobilized after myocardial infarction in non-diabetic patients. Neuronal fibres are reduced in diabetic BM, this defect being associated with blunted response of marrow PC to neuropeptides and decreased nerve growth factor (NGF), which is essential for sensory nerve function/regeneration. This project aims to: 1.Characterize structural alterations underpinning the impaired neuronal control of PC mobilization, 2.Unravel the molecular mechanisms of this deficit and 3.Restore neurotrophic signalling by targeted delivery of NGF to neuronal cells thereby rescuing BM capacity to respond to noxious stimuli. We will also investigate if NGF adds to the protection afforded with metabolic control. Therefore, this proposal has the twofold ambition to clarify key mechanisms of diabetic complications and translate this knowledge into new therapies for devastating complications insufficiently controlled by current treatments.

We showed that Epstein-Barr virus EBNA3A and EBNA3C act as oncoproteins but EBNA3B behaves as a tumour suppressor, the first described in a tumour virus. Our reverse genetic analysis revealed that EBNA3A, 3B and 3C together regulate the expression of specific host genes in B cells, often repressing transcription. This repression involves recruitment of polycomb group (PcG) proteins and the epigenetic mark of repression H3K27me3. Target genes include those encoding the inhibitor of proliferation p16INK4a and pro-apoptotic factor BIM, both of which are repressed in a similar manner in stem cell maintenance and are often silenced in cancer. We have thus proposed that EBV epigenetically reprograms B cells in viral persistence and in B cell lymphomas. The regulation of PcG-mediated repression linked to EBV-associated cancers gives an exceptional opportunity to investigate, in a physiological context, principles of epigenetic silencing. These are likely to have wide application to cancer biology and epigenetic gene regulation by persistent microorganisms. Our key goals are: Detailed biochemical mechanisms for interactions between the EBNA3s and cellular factors responsible for this EBV-mediated reprogramming. Comprehensive genome-wide analyses establishing the extent of EBV-induced reprogramming via the PcG system and the identities of all genes specifically targeted by EBNA3s. To use EBNA3 proteins as tools to understand poorly defined processes in PcG-mediated repression such as the sequence of events in recruitment of complexes to specific target genes. To use our animal model to determine how these processes contribute to EBV persistence, B cell lymphomagenesis and tumour immunosurveillance.

163	Dr Pell	Babraham Institute	None	2010-09-01	2013-08-31	The role of p38 MAPK in the adult muscle stem cell fate and regeneration in ageing	Continued health depends on the ability of adult stem cells to maintain tissue integrity by generating precursor progeny with the potential to both differentiate and self-renew. Newly activated stem cells must undergo a period of proliferation, transit amplification, to provide sufficient cells for regeneration. In ageing, this is significantly impaired. Skeletal muscle adult stem cells (satellite cells) are an excellent exemplar; after the age of 50, muscle mass declines by 10 percent per decade, due to reduced proliferation of satellite cells. This is in large part due inappropriate extrinsic signalling to satellite cells, rather than intrinsic defects. p38 MAPK regulates the progression of transit amplifying cells to irreversible differentiation via phosphorylation of multiple targets to induce cell cycle exit and expression of myogenic genes. The aim of this project is to examine the role of p38 MAPK as a 'gateway' that integrates environmental cues into epigenetic changes to dictate gene expression and adult stem cell behavior. Four related hypotheses will be addressed: 1) p38 activation restricts lineage choice to differentiation at the expense of amplification in muscle precursor and stem cell pools, investigated by generation of conditional p38 knockout mice. 2) p38 has a crucial role in terminal differentiation genes by epigenetic mechanisms, via regulation of chromatin activation (TrxG) and suppression (PcG), determined by genome-wide ChIP-Seq (Illumina sequencing) for H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in primary satellite cells. 3) p38 is activated in a strictly spatially and temporally regulated manner to ensure sufficient proliferation of progenitors in young animals. Candidate signals will be manipulated and subsequent p38 activity assessed. 4) During ageing, mechanisms that suppress premature p38 activation are impaired. Aged control and p38 knockout mice will be investigated with the expectation that decreased muscle mass will be ameliorated in the knockout mice.

The mechanism of DNA cleavage in mariner transposition is the largest gap in our understanding of the cut-and-paste transposons. We are on the verge of solving this problem for Hsmar1. We aim to prove our prediction that the transposase is an asymmetric nuclease which can hydrolyzes two DNA strands of opposite polarity using a single active site. There is only one other probable example of this type, and mariner would be the first amongst the RNase H superfamily of enzymes, which use the two-met al ion catalytic mechanism. We will explore the phenotypes of mutations in a conserved structural motif hypothesized to coordinate catalysis between transposon ends, and which unexpectedly appears to down regulate the rate of transposition. Do these hyperactive mutant proteins provide valuable technology? Another unexplored question is whether transposons have positioned nucleosomes and whether the transposase must compete for binding. One of our goals is to discover whether chromatin stru cture can explain the preferential amplification of many thousands of miniature elements now distributed throughout the human genome. Do these miniature elements provide target sites for SETMAR, a protein that combines the DNA binding domain of Hsmar1 with a histone methylase. If so, what is their function?

Progressive pancreatic beta cell failure, characterised by altered gene expression and cellular "identity", are central to disease development. GWAS for T2D have now identified more than 100 loci associated with disease risk, most of which affect insulin secretion rather than action. In an effort to provide new targets for disease treatment, our laboratories have taken a functional genomic approach to identity the causal gene(s) at selected loci, to dissect their mechanisms of action at the molecular level, and to understand how they interact with other genes and environmental risk factors including over-nutrition. STARD10, located at a T2D locus on chromosome 11q, encodes an intracellular lipid binding and transfer protein whose expression is decreased in the beta cell by possession of risk alleles. Under Aim 1, we will explore the molecular mechanisms through which STARD10 affects insulin processing and secretion in human beta cells and human embryonic cell stem-derived beta cell lines deleted for the gene or nearby regulatory elements using CRISPR/Cas9-medated gene editing. In Aim 2 we will explore the mechanisms through which the protein kinase LKB1, and its downstream substrate AMPK, a nutrient-sensitive protein kinase, control beta cell identity, focussing on epigenetic changes and chromatin remodelling. We will also explore the effects of small molecule AMPK activators on insulin secretion in vivo, and develop a photactivatable AMPK regulator to achieve local control of the enzyme in the pancreas. Aim 3 will determine whether the actions of STARD10 on beta cell function are altered by deletion of LKB1, using both conventional mouse genetics and in vivo imaging of islet function after engraftment into the mouse eye.

166	Dr Marjan Van Der Woude	University of York	None	None	2023-07-31	The intricacy of bacterial epigenetics: DNA methylation-dependent phase variation and the cell cycle in E. coli	The project will explore the relationship between the bacterial cell cycle and the regulation of phase variation of the outer membrane protein Ag43 in Escherichia coli. The heritable nature of the expression phase is a direct result of inheritance of the DNA methylation state at agn43, and the regulation is by definition epigenetic. The processes that facilitate this inheritance during the various stages of the cell cycle are unclear. The specific objectives of this proposal are: 1) Identify the relative roles of OxyR, Dam and SeqA for inheritance of the methylated state of agn43 DNA. 2) Determine the role of DNA replication for agn43 epigenetic regulation. The approaches that will be used include quantitative analyses of protein-DNA interactions in vitro and in vivo analysis of agn43 phase variation in various mutant isolates. Ag43 expression contributes to the development of bacterial communities, and thus elucidating how its expression is controlled over many generations will also increase our understanding of the formation of phenotypic distinct bacterial populations.

These adaptations include metabolic and endocrine changes that may lead to life-long changes in the function and structure the body - a concept which has been termed fetal programming. The suggestion is that the baby receives from its mother a forecast of the nutritional environment it will receive after birth and modifies its metabolism, whole body physiology and growth trajectory appropriately to maximise its chances of survival postnatally. However these adaptations become detrimental if the conditions after birth are not the same as the ones encountered during early life. The inappropriate programming results in a considerably higher susceptibility to developing chronic diseases of adult life. This Developmental Origins of Health and Disease hypothesis proposes that disorders such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes may result from an imbalance between the environment experienced in utero and that experienced postnatally. This hypothesis has been supported by numerous epidemiological studies which have shown an association between low birth weight and later disease and also by studies in animals. The dominant research focus to date has been the defining of the physiological adaptations and metabolic changes in both human and animal studies. However, very few studies have addressed the molecular mechanisms by which a phenomenon that occurs in utero has a phenotypic consequence many years later. Epigenetics refers to covalent modifications of DNA and core histones which are heritable and affect genome function (transcription, recombination, replication) without altering the nucleotide sequence of DNA. Epigenetic mechanisms are essential for development and differentiation and create a memory" of cell identity. Importantly, epigenetic modifications can be modulated by nutritional factors and can act as reversible switches of gene expression to heritably maintain specific genomic regions in a transcriptionally silent or active state. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is therefore an attractive candidate mechanism for fetal programming because it confers and maintains cellular "memory" for many cell divisions. The aim of this proposal is to establish a mechanistic link between maternal diet during pregnancy, epigenetic states of the genome and the developmental origins of adult disease. Using an integrated approach combining molecular biology, whole animal nutritional programming and functional genomics, epigenomics on a defined cell type, the pancreatic beta cell, we will address the following issues. Firstly, we will establish if the epigenetic state of the genome can be altered due to nutritional programming in utero and if such changes can explain programmed changes in gene expression. Secondly, we will identify the critical time windows by which epigenetic memory and gene activity are established by fetal programming. Finally, we will manipulate DNA methylation of key metabolic genes in vitro and profile the transcriptional and metabolic consequences. We will achieve these aims using our well established maternal protein restriction model of fetal programming. Understanding the mechanisms involved in intrauterine nutritional programming could ultimately lead to diagnosis, prevention and potential treatment of long term effects of maternal diet on adult health."

168	Professor Bryan Turner	University of Birmingham	Medical Sciences - Medicine	2004-11-01	2008-03-31	Epigenetics of heterochromatin formation and gene silencing in human embryonic stem cells	Human Embryonic Stem Cells (HESC) can be directed to progress down specific pathways of differentiation, and thereby generate cells committed to defined lineages. Such cells are potentially capable of repairing or replacing damaged tissue when transplanted into patients. As in all other living systems, the progression of HESC down pathways of differentiation is driven by changing patterns of gene expression. These genetic events are regulated by epigenetic mechanisms that switch defined genes on and off at particular stages, and also maintain the on and off states through successive cell generations. In higher eukaryotes, both switching and maintenance mechanisms are profoundly influenced by the packaging of DNA into the cell nucleus as chromatin. It is now clear that chromatin, and hence gene expression, can be altered in complex and subtle ways through the actions of an ever increasing number of enzymes, some of which modify the major DNA packaging proteins, and some of which modify DNA itself. An improved understanding of these fundamental epigenetic events is the central aim of the present proposal, and is an essential first step in fully exploiting the scientific and therapeutic potential of HESC. The project has four specific aims: (i) To establish and characterise new HESC lines using blastocysts from the Assisted Conception Unit at Birmingham Womens? Hospital NHS Trust. (ii) To determine the patterns of histone modification that mark specific genes (autosomal and X-linked) and chromosome domains in the cells of the Inner Cell Mass and how these modifications change in HESC, both before and after differentiation in culture. We will use antibody-based approaches pioneered in the Birmingham lab, primarily Indirect ImmunoFluorescence (IIF) microscopy of metaphase chromosomes and Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation (ChIP). By comparing our results with data from the Human Genome project on the distribution of genes across chromosomes, we can build up a detailed picture of the epigenetic marks carried by particular genomic regions at different stages of development and differentiation. (iii) To elucidate the sequence of epigenetic events that specifies long-term transcriptional silencing of female X-linked genes and the maturation of constitutive heterochromatin during differentiation of HESC. This will be achieved using the same antibody-based approaches as ii. (iv) To identify enzymes responsible for histone modifications on Xi by studying their genomic localisation and by developing procedures, applicable to HESC, for their down-regulation by RNAi.

169	Professor Alan Clarke	Cardiff University	None	2008-07-01	2013-06-30	Validating methylation sensing proteins as therapeutic targets	1) Background: Our previous programme demonstrated that both Mbd2 and Kaiso function to augment tumorigenesis in the intestine, but that this role does not extend to MeCP2, despite having a clear regulatory role in intestinal homeostasis. These observations identify both Mbd2 and Kaiso as potential therapeutic targets for intestinal neoplasia. However, this approach is not informed by the precise mechanism of action of either Mbd2 or Kaiso, and therefore suffers from two potential drawbacks. First, that many of the epigenetic changes induced following Mbd2/Kaiso inactivation may be irrelevant or at worst deleterious to the desired anti-tumorigenic effect. Second, that Mbd2 deficiency alone is sub-optimal in engaging the anti-tumorigenic effect. The current programme aims to address these twin issues. 2) Relevance: Our programme is entirely focused on the modulation of intestinal cancer and the development of new therapuetic targets and reagents. 3) Aims: This renewal therefore seeks to achieve three principle objectives. First, and in conjunction with CRT, to develop and begin to validate novel anti-Mbd2 therapies. Second, to characterise and validate the mechanisms by which Mbd2 and Kaiso modify tumourigenesis. Finally, to build upon this knowledge to identify more targeted and powerful therapeutic strategies. 4) Outline Plan: We have seven experimental objectives: to genetically validate Mbd2 as a therapeutic target within adenomas using a novel LoxP flanked Mbd2 allele; to test the in vivo activities of anti Mbd2 reagents identified by CRT; to determine the mechanistic relevance of the Mbd2 targets Lect2 and Htra1 and the Kaiso targets Tex19, DLGAP and Prox1; to determine the relevance of Mbd2 modulated immune responses to tumorigenesis; to investigate any potential synergy between between Kaiso and Mbd2; and finally to determine if MeCP2 plays a role outwith the intestine by modulating c-Myc dependent tumorigenesis in the prostate.

In combination with human preimplantation embryos, in vitro models and hPGCs from aborted fetuses, our objective is to elucidate the origin and properties of the early human germline. For the mechanism of the hPGC fate, we will use experimental models that simulate early human development. We aim to investigate how cells gain competence for germ cell fate, and then respond to combinatorial effects of the critical transcription factors, which induce hPGC specification. Altogether, this study will reveal the organisation of the very early human embryo, and mechanisms of hPGC and somatic outcomes, which is essential for advances in regenerative medicine. Following hPGC specification, epigenetic resetting of the early human germline leads to extensive erasure of DNA methylation and epimutations in response to the critical regulators of chromatin organisation and nuclear architecture towards the epigenetic ground state. Some conserved resistant loci ('escapees') evade reprogramming. We will explore if some escapees have been exapted to function as regulatory elements. If so, this may have a crucial influence on human development, including brain development and neuronal diseases.	Wellcome Trust	Investigator Award in Science	2750000.0	GBP

This has provided an initial experimental framework, and testable predictions for extrinsic and intrinsic factors needed for further development of PGCs. PGC specific reporter cell lines will provide development-monitoring assays for advanced PGCs by high-throughput live cell imaging. Long-term culture with hourly quantitative information of the fluorescence activation allows for simultaneous testing of 576 conditions. We will screen for cytokines and small compounds to stimulate development of PGCs, using the candidates identified by bioinformatic modeling, complemented by unbiased screening with commercial compound libraries, including small molecules to lower the epigenetic barriers for development. For intrinsic factors, we will focus on transcriptional factors that are specifically activated sequentially in vivo PGCs. We will conduct co-culture of nascent PGCs with human/porcine gonadal or Sertoli cells to provide a favorable niche, combined with extrinsic and/or intrinsic approaches to increase the probability of finding the best conditions for PGC development. Our immediate aim is combine all the information to generate equivalent of ~Wk10 PGCs in culture, which covers a period of significant epigenetic program leading to comprehensive erasure of DNA methylation. These PGCs will be compared bioinformatically with in vivo gonadal counterparts, gametes and seminoma. We aim to understand the overall mechanisms that regulate PGC development, together with the mechanisms of germ cell programming, as well as causes of disorders, by using patient specific iPSCs and gene modifications. We will also perform global gene inhibition and activation screening with CRISPR/Cas9. When appropriate, we will collaborate on some aspects, for example on the mitochondrial bottleneck and purification in early PGCs.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	637331.0	GBP

The exploitation of such systems has produced true revolutions in biotechnology; firstly, the restriction-modification (RM) enzymes for genetic engineering, and secondly, CRISPR-Cas9 for gene editing. This project aims to unravel the mechanisms and consequences of prokaryotic immune systems that target covalently-modified DNA, such as base methylation, hydroxymethylation and glucosylation. Very little is known about these Type IV restriction enzymes at a mechanistic level, or about their importance to the coevolution of prokaryotic-phage communities. I propose a unique interdisciplinary approach that combines biophysical and single-molecule analysis of enzyme function, nucleoprotein structure determination, prokaryotic evolutionary ecology, and epigenome sequencing, to link the molecular mechanisms of prokaryotic defence to individual, population and community-level phenotypes. This knowledge is vital to a full understanding of how bacterial immunity influences horizontal gene transfer, including the spread of virulence or antimicrobial resistance. In addition, a deeper analysis of enzyme function will support our reengineering of these systems to produce improved restriction enzyme tools for the mapping of eukaryotic epigenetics markers.

An important question is how a single set of genes can be used in different ways to produce these different types of cells. One answer that is now emerging is that the genes are modified in semi-permanent ways - epigenetically - so that some can be switched on and others cannot. Thus different types of cells have the same genes, but different epigenetic states. Important questions are how these epigenetic states are set up and to what extent and under what circumstances they can be changed. An understanding of this will have far reaching consequences for biology and medicine. In animals, it is relatively difficult to change epigenetic states, which is probably one reason why most animal cell types cannot be regenerated. On the other hand, plant cells are much more flexible in their development, which is why plants can often be regenerated from pieces of tissue (cuttings) or even single cells. One reason for this is likely to lie in the way plant genomes are modified epigenetically. We have begun a detailed study of one gene that is responsible for causing specific cells in the root of a plant to become root hair cells. We have been able to show by advanced microscopy that the region of the DNA containing this gene is in a different physical state in cells that will become root hair cells from cells that will not. Furthermore, we have shown by looking at naturally occurring aberrant cells that this difference in state is reversible and is reset every time the cells divide. In this proposal we will study the detailed biochemical basis of the physical difference in this gene. This should ultimately allow us to find out how and why the genes are in different states in different cells, and how this state is set and reset. We expect that this will help to explain how plant cells can change their developmental fates more easily than animal cells.

However, there is evidence to suggest that the diet of a pregnant woman is particularly important as it has major long-term implications on the health of her offspring so, in some ways we also are what our mothers ate during pregnancy. Normal term babies born from mothers with poor nutrition during pregnancy usually have a low weight. It has been shown that individuals with a low birth weight are not only less likely to survive delivery but are also at substantially increased risk of developing various common diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and heart disease in adulthood. The underlying causes of the relationship between poor early growth and disease in adulthood are not known, but we believe that the quality of the diet of women during pregnancy is critically important. Many of our attempts to decipher mechanisms of human diseases both rely and benefit from studying animal models. We have shown in a rodent model that if pregnant animals have too little protein during pregnancy their babies are small at birth and develop diabetes in adulthood. We have identified important genes in the pancreas that are expressed at low levels in the offspring of protein-restricted mothers compared to control animals. We now plan to study further these animals to understand how a restricted diet is able to perturb expression of key genes involved in pathogenesis of diabetes. We are particularly interested in studying epigenetic mechanisms that is mechanisms able to change activity of a gene without altering its DNA sequence that could be triggered by nutritional changes during pregnancy. We also want to know more precisely at which time/s during pregnancy the quality of the mother's diet is most important for giving birth to healthy babies. This will enable us to both identify at risk individuals and to develop intervention strategies to improve the health of both the pregnant women and their offspring.

179	Dr Paul Badenhorst	University of Birmingham	None	2009-01-01	2011-12-31	Genome-wide mapping of targets and epigenetic regulators of the chromatin remodelling enzyme NURF	Background Eukaryotic genetic information is stored in chromatin, in which DNA is compacted by being wrapped around a spool of histone proteins to form nucleosomes. During all DNA-templated processes, chromatin undergoes dynamic remodelling to control access to the associated DNA. Chromatin remodelling utilizes several basic mechanisms, including ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling, covalent histone modification and histone variant exchange to alter accessibility to the DNA. ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling enzymes such as the nucleosome remodelling factor (NURF) utilize the energy of ATP hydrolysis to slide nucleosomes along DNA. By sliding nucleosomes, NURF can alternatively expose or block transcription factor binding sites, and thus activate or repress transcription. Relevance to cancer Mutation of Drosophila NURF interferes with hematopoietic development, causing blood tumours. NURF binds a specific post-translationally-modified histone (H3K4(Me)3), which is proposed to recruit NURF to gene targets. In addition, acetylation of histone H4 at Lys16 can regulate the in vitro activity of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers. Both modifications have been linked to cancer. MLL, the enzyme that establishes H3K4(Me)3, is implicated in 80% of acute myeloid or lymphoblastic leukemias, while loss of H4K16Ac a common hallmark of human cancers. In addition, we have shown that disruption of the variant histone H2A.Z recapitulates NURF blood tumour phenotypes. In this proposal we will determine how cross-talk between histone variant exchange and histone post-translational modifications control NURF-activity in vivo. Because NURF is conserved between Drosophila and humans, this information will help to understand the functions of the corresponding human NURF complex and its potential involvement in leukemias and cancer. This knowledge is vital as ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling factors are potential drug targets in the fight against these diseases. Aims and methods In this proposal we will identify the in vivo chromatin targets of NURF and investigate how NURF activity at these promoters is influenced by histone post-translational modification and variant histone incorporation. Building upon previous work showing that Drosophila NURF represses the JAK/STAT pathway and prevents blood tumours we will:- i. Determine chromatin targets of NURF by mapping genome-wide changes in nucleosome position that occur in NURF mutant blood cells. ii. Use massively-parallel signature sequencing in combination with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChiP-Seq) to determine the genome-wide distribution of NURF complexes. iii. Use ChIP-Seq to determine how histone post-translational modifications and the variant histone H2A.Z affect recruitment and activity of NURF. iv. Determine functions of the histone variant H2A.Z in blood tumor production.	Cancer Research UK	Project Award	None	None

Deregulation of the p14ARF gene has been associated with breast cancer development, but the molecular events underlying these processes are not well understood. Our recent studies demonstrated that p14ARF gene is regulated by a multifunctional 11 Zn-finger transcription factor, CTCF, and a post-translational modification, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) of CTCF. CTCF normally activates p14ARF and this activation relies on the presence of both, CTCF and the PARylation enzyme-1, PARP-1, at the CTCF binding site (CTS) identified within the p14ARF promoter. The aim of the proposed investigation is to test two hypotheses: 1. There is a causal link between CTCF and PARP-1 association at the p14ARF CTS, defective CTCF (and possibly PARP-1) PARylation and p14ARF deregulation. 2. CTCF and PARP-1 act as a “rheostat” regulating changes in epigenetic configuration at the p14ARF CTS. To achieve this Aim, we will study the following four Objectives: Objective 1 Analysis of the expression of p14ARF mRNA and the status of CTCF and PARP-1 in the experimental cell models. Objective 2 Analysis of the role of CTCF and PARP-1 in the establishment of the epigenetic states at the p14ARF CTS. Objective 3 Analysis of p14ARF mRNA levels and their correlation with epigenetic states at the p14ARF CTS in normal and tumour breast tissues. Objective 4 Is the p14ARF CTS a “master” p14ARF regulatory element? Analysis of the additional CTSs within the INK/ARF locus and their contribution to the regulation of p14ARF. We will use model cell lines with different levels of p14ARF mRNA expression to assess the role of CTCF and PARP-1 in the regulation of the epigenetic states at the CTS within the p14ARF promoter and also at other CTSs in the INK/ARF locus. Our observations will then be further validated using breast tumour tissues. We will employ a wide range of methods including RT-QPCR, QPCR, ChIP, re-ChIP, bisulfite sequencing, pyrosequencing, Western, gel retardation, methylation interference and various cell/tissue culture techniques. The results obtained will be used to better understand the molecular mechanisms of p14ARF regulation by CTCF and PARP-1. Thus, elucidation of the role of epigenetic alterations in p14ARF can provide an insight into the nature of predisposition to and early stages of breast tumourigenesis. These results may also be valuable for design of anti-cancer treatment because epigenetic changes can potentially be reversed with the right therapies.

Mutation or modification of the INK locus has been found to be the second most frequent perturbation in cancer. Thus, there is great interest in genes such as CBX7 that regulate the INK locus. CBX7 is a member of the large polycomb group of proteins, originally identified in Drosophila. They are thought to act, at least in part, through histone modification in target loci and thus can set up epigenetic chromatin modifications that are heritable through cell division and animal development. Our initial observations suggest that CBX7 is itself an oncogene, that associates with a newly identified histone methyl transferase. In this proposal we have five specific objectives. The role of CBX7 in oncogenic transformation. This will extend our initial observation that CBX7 can act as an oncogene in the mouse immune system, in continuing mouse work but also by analysis of human tumours. Mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by CBX7. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies indicate that CBX7 acts through histone methylation at the INK locus. We will define the relevant target DNA elements required, identify further proteins that function with CBX7 (see below) and evaluate their biological roles. Analysis of CBX7 function in vivo. The closest functional relative of CBX7 is the Bmi1 polycomb protein, that also acts at the INK locus. Loss-of-function Bmi causes, inter alia, defects in stem cell renewal. Thus we will do a variety of CBX7 mouse knock-out studies and with appropriate genetic crosses elaborate the role of this gene in normal development and in adult life. Comparative dissection of the composition of Pc containing complexes. A variety of approaches will be taken to identify proteins, other than those we have already identified, that act in concert with CBX7 in gene regulation. Role of other PcG in oncogenesis. In silico and other approaches have led us to five polycomb group proteins that are likely oncogenes, in common with CBX7 and Bmi1. These will be explored, genetically and biochemically.

182	Prof Antonella Riccio	University College London	MRC Laboratory of Molecular Cell Biology	2009-06-01	2014-10-05	Novel mechanisms of gene expression in developing mammalian neurons	One of the most complex and challenging problems in biology is to understand how the billions of neurons in the vertebrate nervous system wire up to form the neural circuits that underlie all behaviour. During the early stages of embryonic development, neuronal precursors exit the cell cycle and differentiate into an enormous variety of neurons, each programmed to extend dendrites and an axon that can respond to guidance cues and form synapses with appropriate partner cells. Each of these events requires expression of large numbers of specific genes, which encode proteins that promote differentiation, cell survival, guided cell and growth cone migration, synapse formation, and, later, synaptic plasticity. However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of gene expression during these critical events remain largely unknown. We have recently discovered a novel epigenetic modification of the chromatin surrounding the promoters of neurotrophin-responsive genes in cortical neurons that influences the transcription of these genes (Riccio et al., Mol Cell, 21,283-94, 2006). Using in vitro and in vivo assays we found that BDNF induced the synthesis of nitric oxide, which regulated histone acetylation by directly nitrosylating nuclear proteins associated with gene promoters. This was the first evidence that an extracellular stimulus can induce epigenetic modifications by means of S-nitrosylation of transcriptional complexes. Furthermore, we now know that histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) is one of the targets of BDNF-dependent S-nitrosylation. Structure to function analysis has revealed that two specific cysteines in HDAC2 are S-nitrosylated upon BDNF treatment, resulting in increased chromatin acetylation and gene transcription. These exciting findings offer a wealth of potential directions and I will focus my future research on the following goals: - generate a knock-in transgenic mouse bearing the Cys/Cys HDAC2 mutation - identify genes regulated by NO during neuronal development in vivo - characterize neurotrophin-dependent NO signalling Two additional research projects in my laboratory are centred on epigenetic modifications in developing neurons in vitro and following behavioural stimulation in vivo. Local protein synthesis has emerged as an important mechanism by which gene expression can be regulated in highly polarized cells, such as neurons. In recent years, for example, there has been a great effort to characterize mRNAs localized in dendrites but there has not been a corresponding effort to characterize mRNAs in axons and growth cones. There is a major technical problem in isolating axonal mRNAs, which is that the axons and their terminals must be physically separated from the cell bodies and the surrounding glial cells. We routinely utilize compartmentalized chambers to grow neurons in conditions that allow a complete separation between axon terminals and cell bodies. By combining compartmentalized cultures of sympathetic neurons with Sequence Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) assay, we have performed an unbiased screen to identify mRNAs localized in axons. We found several hundred transcripts in axons, and many of them are selectively enriched in axon terminals when compared to cell bodies. A significant number of these encode proteins involved in neuronal growth, axon guidance and regeneration. Unexpectedly, we found that IMPA1, the inositol monophosphatase that is a target of lithium, is the most abundant axonal transcript, and we are now characterizing its role in axonal growth.

We recently showed, using recombinant Epstein-Barr viruses from which individual EBNA3s were deleted, that EBNA3A and EBNA3C functionally interact to repress the expression of the cellular gene BIM. Coincidentally we discovered that the BIM promoter exhibits CpG methylation in all the B cells carrying latent EBV that we examined. It appears that EBV can initiate epigenetic silencing and CpG methylation of BIM and perhaps other cellular genes. Our aim is to systematically investigate genome-wi de CpG methylation and histone modification patterns after infection of B cells (EBV-negative Burkitt s lymphoma and CD19+ve primary cells) with EBV. This should reveal cellular genes that are epigenetically modified by latent EBV gene products. Prototypic B95.8 EBV and the EBNA3-deletion viruses will be used, so the roles of these EBV repressors of transcription in modifying the B cell epigenome and gene expression patterns will be determined. In addition to using genome-wide tiled-arrays to an alyse approximately 25,500 promoters for DNA methylation and histone modifications (such as H3K9 methylation), the same viruses and cells will be used for standard microarray expression analyses. We will also assess the role of the EBNA3s in the epigenetic silencing of viral gene expression thought to be necessary for persistence in vivo.	Wellcome Trust	Project Grant	284612.0	GBP

However, due to the limited number of mapped markers used in all of the previous studies and the inability of all of the studies to discriminate between sequences derived from the different homoeologous chromosomes, definitive proof for this view remains elusive. In this proposal we aim to use recently technology, developed at Bristol, to simultaneously map several thousand wheat transcripts and identify progenitor specific transcripts in both the diploid and tetaploid progenitors and the resulting synthetic wheat to provide definitive proof to confirm or refute that genomic rearrangement and epigenetic silencing do occur during the generation of allohexaploid wheat. We will also use the transcript-related information obtained from synthetic wheat and compare this to the situation in current and established hexaploid wheat varieties to determine whether these rearrangements are predetermined or random in nature.

The prototype of the cell product, consisting of saphenous vein-derived pericyte progenitor cells (SVPs), proved to be therapeutically effective in preclinical models of peripheral or myocardial ischaemia. Supplementation of pericytes stabilises the peri-infarct neovascularisation which is otherwise prone to leak and break. Furthermore, SVPs exert a spectrum of reparative actions including recruitment of pro-angiogenic monocytes and cardiac progenitor cells and inhibition of apoptosis and fibrosis. No safety concerns were reported. We propose now to validate the capability of a defined system of technical procedures to increase total throughput of cells and obtain a reliable, reproducible and quality-assured cell product in view of performing a first-in-man clinical trial with autologous SVPs in coronary artery disease patients unresponsive to medications and not amenable to revascularization. The project comprises 3 work-packages (WP), 6 milestones (M) and a contingency plan for prevention, troubleshooting and alternative solutions. The goal of WP1 is to scale up current protocol to improve the yield of extraction/expansion (M1) and introduce clinical-grade and xeno-free reagents (M2). The goal of WP2 is to transfer the protocol to the GMP facilities of the National Health Service-Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) for clinical-grade manufacture of at least 6 SVP lines (M3), followed by quality control of antigenic and genomic/epigenetic stability (M4). The goal of WP3 is to test the performance of individual SVP lines (WP5) and assess the therapeutic efficacy in a mouse model of myocardial infarction using a randomised factorial protocol (WP6).

The next challenge is to identify the corresponding functional genetic variants, the molecular mechanisms by which they act, and the cellular pathways they modulate. Most single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with AS are not in exons and are therefore more likely to have regulatory rather than protein coding effects. In this project we shall assess the function of regulatory genetic variants near IL23R and RUNX3, which have been implicated strongly in the pathogenesis of AS (IL23R p=5x10-21; RUNX3 p=2.6x10-15) and other related inflammatory conditions. We have integrated genetic and epigentic data to identify candidate regulatory SNPs and will test which of these disrupt gene expression in AS patients. We will go on to define the precise epigenetic mechanisms through which SNPs alter transcription and identify the cellular effects of altered gene regulation in AS patients. This type of genetic-bioinformatic-epigenetic methodology can also be applied to other associated loci in the future. This research will highlight specific functional alterations in the immune system of AS patients and will identify the specific cell types involved, findings that have translational potential for drug development.

So far arcOGEN has discovered nine novel OA signals. What is emerging as an area of increasing interest is the understanding that epigenetic effects can impact on the penetrance of genetic susceptibility, for example by modulating the expression of a susceptibility allele, and that integrating genetics and epigenetics can therefore clarify genetic association signals. We have shown this in our recent publication, where we demonstrated that CpG methylation impacts on the OA susceptibility coded for by GDF5. In this application we shall conduct a comprehensive DNA methylation analysis of the genes from within the arcOGEN association signals. We shall use nucleic acid from patient cartilage and a quantitative methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) protocol. Our data will allow us to assess in which genes CpG methylation correlates with the association signals and as such it will allow us to narrow those signals, by highlighting functional regions, and will enable us to assess the degree to which the signals are modulated epigenetically.

It is disease course after diagnosis, however, that determines a patient’s outcome, and the factors driving this variable prognosis have been largely ignored. We have focused on uncovering the biology underlying clinical outcome in immune-mediated disease. We have identified two CD8 T-cell transcription signatures that are associated with outcome but not diagnosis in four important immune-mediated diseases (Nat Med 2010, JCI 2011), and found that the signature associated with poor outcome is characterized by CD8 T cell “exhaustion” (Nature 2015). Genetic studies confirmed that pathways underlying prognosis are distinct from those underlying disease susceptibility (Cell 2013). We will explore this “biology of prognosis”. Our goals are to: 1) understand the biological basis of the CD8 T-cell transcription signature that determines prognosis. This will use in vitro and human in vivo studies, alongside genetic and epigenetic analyses informing our understanding of the mechanisms of prognosis in immune-mediated disease, and allowing the refinement of biomarkers now entering the clinic. 2) develop approaches to modulate CD8 T-cell exhaustion to treat disease, by re-purposing existing drugs, defining their mechanisms of action, and testing key candidates drugs in vitro and in animal models.

Presenting with sleep disturbance it is labelled fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia is known to have a genetic basis and a few candidate genes have been proposed. The first genome-wide association meta-analysis was recently performed but in keeping with many common complex traits, the proportion of heritability explained by these variants remains small. Epigenetic modification by, for example, methylation of DNA may provide the link between genetic variants and environmental influence in expression of common complex traits. There are many other biological steps between DNA code (genomics) and the end phenotype (fibromyalgia) including gene transcription, translation and post-translational modification. Such “omics” measures (transcriptomics, metabolomics, glycomics etc) reduce the “distance” between DNA and phenotype and improve the signal to noise ratio, allowing discovery of new associations and identification of pathways leading to pathology. This project's aims are to: identify methylation differences in fibromyalgia explore other omics in relation to known genetic variants identify novel biomarkers of fibromyalgia This project uses existing data – genetic, epigenetic and ‘omic - available in TwinsUK to answer questions about the abnormalities present in fibromyalgia, and to identify biomarkers for CWP.

191	Professor Bryan Turner	University of Birmingham	None	2008-10-01	2012-03-31	Epigenetic mechanisms in development and cancer	The histones of the nucleosome core particle are subject to various enzyme-catalyzed modifications, mostly to their N-terminal tails. These modifications, directly or indirectly, alter DNA packaging and can thereby regulate gene expression. The enzymes that modify histones can be activated or inhibited by metabolic and environmental variables. Some depend on common metabolites such as NAD, while others are inhibited by common environmental or dietary components, such as short chain fatty acids. The nucleosome is a sensor through which environmental and metabolic changes influence genomic function. In the present research we ask whether environmentally-induced changes in histone modification can induce long-term, heritable changes in patterns of gene expression. Cancer is known to be induced by a variety of environmental toxins, generally thought to operate by causing genetic mutations, ie. changes in DNA. We will ask whether environmental variables can also cause heritable changes in expression of key genes (oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes) by altering histone modifications, providing an epigenetic route to cancer initiation or progression.. As model systems to study the induction of histone modifications and their heritability, we will use mouse embryos grown in culture and mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. We will focus on mechanisms by which genes on one X chromosome are heritably inactivated during differentiation of female ES cells. We will use X inactivation to explore the possible link between histone modifications catalyzed by polycomb group proteins and DNA methylation, often aberrant on numerous genes in cancer. To define patterns of histone modification across selected genes we will use chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), assaying precipitated DNA either by Real Time Quantitative PCR for analysis of key genes or with DNA microarrays to provide genome-wide assay of levels of DNA methylation, histone modification and enzyme distribution during ES cell differentiation. Using a novel technique that allows ChIP data to be obtained from as few as 100 cells (CChIP), we are able to study epigenetic changes in primary cells. We will follow environmentally-induced changes in defined cell populations (eg Inner Cell Mass, trophectoderm) from the developing embryo and in small clusters of cells excised from tissue sections by laser capture. In collaborative work, we will use the latter approach us to look for epigenetic changes in cells of defined type, either cancerous or normal, from sections taken from colon cancers at different stages of development and from premalignant tissue.

192	Professor Antony Carr	University of Sussex	Sch of Life Sciences	2011-10-01	2017-06-30	Replication fork stability and fork restart	The DNA in our cells is at its most vulnerable when it is being replicated. A significant proportion of the mutations, chromosomal rearrangements and epigenetic changes associated with human genetic disease and cancer are thought to be generated by stochastic and DNA damage-induced replication errors. Furthermore, many chemotherapeutic drugs are specifically toxic to replicating cells, a feature that imparts therapeutic index but which also limits their utility due to side effects on rapidly dividing normal cells. The DNA Damage Response (DDR) pathways act to suppress genetic change in the face of endogenous and exogenous replicative stress. It has become evident that the majority of cancer cells are defective in one or more DDRs. Some DDRs, such as the intra-S phase checkpoint, are proposed to be mutated in order for a pre-cancerous cell to overcome the barrier to carcinogenesis imposed by oncogene-induced senescence. Mutations in other DDRs are proposed to be selected for because they allow increased genome stability, thus promoting tumour development and evolution. My long-term aim is to provide detailed mechanistic information that will assist the development of rational ?synthetic lethality? therapies in order to target cancers with specific changes or combinations of changes in DDR proteins and pathways, as well as to help identify potential new targets for drug development. Therefore, in this program I propose to study the relationship between DNA replication and the DDR to investigate how these pathways contribute to maintaining genome stability. Specifically, I will use a model eukaryote, S. pombe, to help to elucidate and understand how the intra-S phase checkpoint regulates DNA metabolism to maintain replication forks in a stable conformation. I will also explore the mechanisms and consequences of replication fork restart, which is necessary when these stabilisation pathways fail. I hypothesise that a relatively under-explored protein, TopBP1, plays important roles in coordinating the transitions made by the replication and repair apparatus during fork arrest and restart by virtue of its ability to act as a multi-functional phospho-protein binding scaffold: TopBP1 can respond to a range of regulatory phosphorylation events and thus act as a ?node? coordinating signalling pathways by integrating disparate phosphorylation events. I will therefore continue my exploration of TopBP1 functions in yeast and higher eukaryotes.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	2146190.0	GBP

These sRNAs influence diverse aspects of growth and development by targeting RNA degradation or DNA methylation. The proposed work is based on the hypothesis that sRNA profiles (SIROtypes) are predictors of the genetic and epigenetic regulation of cells and of valuable traits in plant breeding. Preliminary work has established the potential for extensive variation in the SIROtypes that can be exploited in crop improvement. The sRNAs are derived from up to 5000 loci in the Arabidopsis genome and there is variation in the sRNA profile of closely related tomatoes or in Arabidopsis. High throughput sequencing will be used to characterize the sRNAs in tomato cultivars grown in various conditions including stress conditions. The different loci producing sRNAs or that are their potential targets will be identified by aligning the sequences of the sRNAs with genome sequence of the crop plants. Array technology will then be developed for profiling the sRNA in plant populations with polymorphic phenotypes. Statistical analysis will then be used to establish the correlation between the phenotypes and production of specific sRNAs. Array based SIROtyping will identify a subset of sRNA loci that are predictors of phenotypes. To validate the utility of this sRNA subset an RT-PCR method will be used for assay of the informative sRNA clusters in large populations. The proposed work will also evaluate the possibility that important agronomic traits can be modified when selected sRNAs are overexpressed or suppressed transgenically. These analyses and manipulations of sRNAs have the potential to establish a novel approach to crop improvement that is based on variation of regulatory RNAs rather than of protein coding genes.

196	Prof Dame Caroline Dean	John Innes Centre	None	None	2017-06-30	Role of small RNAs in Vernalization	Plant growth and development show remarkable plasticity in response to changes in environment. Our understanding of these responses is poor but advances have been made in dissecting the mechanism of vernalization, the acceleration of flowering by a period of prolonged cold. Vernalization occurs at one stage of development and is then `remembered until later in development. The epigenetic regulation of the Arabidopsis gene FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), a strong floral repressor, is a major component of this molecular memory. But it is still not clear how prolonged cold initiates FLC repression and how specific domains of FLC as targets for histone modifications. An emerging concept is that small RNAs play major roles in repressing gene expression and guiding chromatin complexes to targets. The aim of this project will be to determine the role of small RNAs in the cold-induced repression of FLC and the cellular memory of vernalization. This will be achieved in a collaboration between the Dean (JIC) and Baulcombe (SL) laboratories, experts in vernalization/FLC regulation and small RNAs respectively and will provide a paradigm for a more general understanding of gene regulation in response to environmental changes. Small RNAs associated with vernalization will then be studied in Arabidopsis accessions with different vernalization responses (identified during the NERC Environmental Genomics programme), to uncover the molecular variation underpinning the adaptation of Arabidopsis accessions to varying winter lengths.

In animals and plants the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) is involved in maintaining genes in an epigenetic 'off' state. In mammals and flies a second complex, PRC1, collaborates with PRC2 to maintain silencing. Interestingly, other organisms including worms and plants lack PRC1 and it remains elusive how they achieve stable silencing. In Arabidopsis the DNA-binding protein VRN1 is a potential candidate to fulfil such a role in silencing. During a cold-induced process called vernalization, the floral repressor gene FLC is epigenetically repressed and maintained inactive by a plant PRC2 and VRN1. Lack of VRN1 does not impair PRC2 function but seems to act downstream or in parallel of PRC2, a situation analogous to animal PRC1. Moreover, as found for mammalian PRC1, VRN1 interacts with a component of the spliceosome complex, implying RNA processing in Polycomb silencing. The above findings suggest that VRN1, despite its lack of homology with PRC1 components, functions in the stable maintenance of PRC2 mediated silencing. My aim is to establish a solid foundation for a mechanistic understanding of VRN1 mediated gene silencing using vernalization as a model. In-depth VRN1 protein-complex analysis will be complemented by chromatin and RNA immuno-precipitations (ChIP and RIP) as well as theoretical modelling of the vernalization process. Besides addressing a long-standing question in plant epigenetics, collected data will allow comparison with the situation in non-plant systems to develop a mechanistic consensus model on maintenance of gene silencing in different kingdoms. Notably, for both plants and humans, fundamental knowledge of epigenetics will facilitate the modulation of gene expression to; increase yield and disease resistance in crops and develop treatments for diseases, such as cancer, in humans.

Deregulated D-type cyclins are key initiators of PC malignancy, however mechanistic understanding is constrained by the paradigm that normal PCs are post-mitotic and irreversibly exit cell cycle. Concepts of PCs as short-lived effectors influence the irreversible cell cycle exit paradigm. While long-lived human PCs are now well established, and provide the normal counterpart to myeloma PCs, there is no direct evidence regarding the nature of their quiescent state. Thus fundamental questions remain unanswered in myeloma pathogenesis. The absence of a model system allowing in vitro PC maintenance has limited evaluation. We have resolved this problem and are now uniquely placed to address how cell cycle quiescence is established and maintained in PCs, and how it is deregulated in early neoplasia. Our hypothesis is that long-lived PCs are quiescent but can be physiologically triggered into replicative self-renewal. We propose a set of signaling and transcriptional control mechanisms that establish a threshold for PC replicative self-renewal. In this model, aberrant D-type cyclin expression results in early PC neoplasia by lowering a physiologic threshold, rather than by preventing irreversible cell cycle exit. We will test our hypothesis, and address: OBJECTIVE-1: How transcriptional regulators of differentiation and cell cycle are linked in PCs. OBJECTIVE-2: How myeloma-oncogenes impact on cell cycle exit and differentiation. OBJECTIVE-3: How a realized niche governs quiescence in normal and neoplastic PCs. Our goal is thus to test a fundamental question in myeloma pathogenesis, using a range of novel approaches, link this to an evaluation of primary samples from early PC neoplasms. Epigenetic regulation is emerging as an important aspect of myeloma development, our results will provide the basis for understanding how PC neoplasm arise, and how their epigenetic state is altered in malignancy. We aim to identify potential markers of disease progression, provide a rationale for novel treatment approaches, and identify predictive markers of therapeutic response.

Using ES cells as a powerful tool, we will assess the progression of epigenetic reprogramming at ICRs upon Parp1 deletion and the factors involved. In a series of intercalated experiments, we will elucidate whether Parp1 is an integral component of the ICR chromatin protein complex, or whether it is the conferred post-translational modification of ICR complex members that is critical for imprint maintenance. We will also test whether the few genomic regions that are hypomethylated in Parp1-/- ES cells in addition to known ICRs demarcate yet unknown imprinting control regions that may identify novel imprinted genes. In parallel, the impact of Parp1 deficiency on imprinted gene regulation in vivo will be scrutinized. We will assess existing knockout models (of mild severity level) of Parp1, the highly related Parp2, and double mutants. The analyses will include to determine, in candidate and genome-wide approaches, the effect on DNA methylation, histone modifications (H3K9me3) and imprinted gene expression during gestation and postnatally. This will be complemented by a detailed analysis of developmental progression, postnatal and adult health, including assessment of the putative link to obesity that has been previously noted. Germ line mutants will serve to determine whether Parp1 (& Parp2) play a role in the establishment as well as the maintenance of gametic imprints, in epigenome surveillance and protection from transgenerational inheritance of epimutations. This research is pertinent to our understanding of imprinting disorders and how they might arise for example in infertility treatments. Thereby, it will identify novel avenues for potential therapeutic intervention. It also provides direct links between epigenome (dys)regulation and cancer biology, in which Parp1 is a major player.

The study of childhood cancer and associated syndromes, such as those that result in global or regional overgrowth, has resulted in important insights into basic biological processes and substantial clinical benefits. Through the Factors Associated with Childhood Tumours (FACT) and Childhood Overgrowth Genetics (COG) studies, we recruit and phenotype families with childhood cancer and/or overgrowth and have over 6000 participants. We have already used these unique studies to identify common and rare genetic and epigenetic susceptibility factors for these conditions. However, these only account for a minority of children. The proposed research will extend our research and will address three key questions: 1. What are the genetic and epigenetic factors that predispose to childhood cancer and/or overgrowth conditions? 2. What are the distinctive somatic characteristics of cancers that arise in children with genetic or epigenetic susceptibility conditions? 3. How can we translate these findings for clinical benefit? We will employ genome-wide exomic, genomic and methylation analyses to discover new predisposition factors, together with targeted replication and large-scale characterisation analyses to define prevalence, penetrance, associated clinical features, the spectrum of pathogenic mutations and genotype-phenotype associations. The tumour analyses will yield insights into tumourigenesis and can provide unique information about the timing and order of molecular events i n tumours, as the predisposing mutation is clearly the initiating/first event. We will integrate these data to define the clinically relevant information required for clinical translation of new genes/epigenetic defects and to produce diagnostic, management and testing protocols for use in clinical practice.

Our group is well placed to translate these opportunities through linking a multidisciplinary team with laboratory, clinical research and modelling expertise to our unique population cohorts, databases and sample biobanks. Relevance: OC is the 4th commonest cause of death from cancer amongst women in the UK. Over 70% of patients have advanced stage disease and less than 30% of these patients survive 5 years. Aims: The overall aim is to develop and validate models for risk stratification, early detection and diagnosis of OC which incorporate clinical, epidemiological, genetic, epigenetic, proteomic and imaging data and to then assess how best to apply them in large populations. Outline: The research plan involves 2 Themes ?Risk Stratification' and ?Early Detection/Diagnosis' with 3 ?Workstreams' for each theme (1-model development, 2-model validation and 3-implementation). Collaborative links will add expertise in modelling, psychology and health economics. The risk stratification model in Theme A will incorporate epidemiological and genetic data including rare high-penetrance genes and low-moderate penetrance common genetic variants. Using our unique resource of biobanks and databases algorithms will be developed for each data type and predictors of risk combined in order to develop an OC risk prediction algorithm. This will be validated using DNA samples, family history and epidemiological data in our population based low-risk (UKCTOCS, 202,000 women) and high-risk (UKFOCSS, 5000 women) cohorts. We will evaluate acceptability, feasibility, psychological impact and affect on quality of life of the new risk stratification models. We will evaluate approaches to cost-effective delivery of key risk related information and compare novel approaches with traditional counselling methodologies. In Theme B novel biomarker data obtained from our in house discovery programme, ongoing collaborative studies and published literature will be used to improve our ROCA and RMI models for screening and diagnosis. Further epigenetic, clinical and ultrasound data will be incorporated into model development. The models will be validated in independent data sets from our UKCTOCS, UKFOCSS and UKOPS studies. Pilot studies will assess the feasibility and psychological impact of the optimal early detection model in population screening. In parallel we will assess the health economic characteristics of both the risk stratification model and early detection/diagnosis model.	Cancer Research UK	Programme Award	None	None

Telomere maintenance and length regulation is central to genome stability and cell immortality and plays important roles both in cancer and ageing. It is therefore important to understand factors that influence telomere function, as deleterious affects can contribute to disease risk. The human herpesvirus 6 can be subdivided into two types, A and B. These viruses often cause a mild illness in early childhood and then persist lifelong in a latent form in some cells. Reactivation of the latent virus often occurs in immuno-compromised patients where it is can be pathogenic. Unlike other human herpesviruses both HHV-6A and 6B can integrate into the telomeric region of chromosomes and the chromosomally integrated form (CI-HHV-6) can be inherited. About 1% of the UK population are carriers for a full-length integrated copy at one chromosome end but the rate and mechanism of germ-line integration are poorly understood. Moreover it is not known whether the presence of CI-HHV-6 influences disease risk in carriers. It is reasonable to hypothesis that the insertion of the ~160kb HHV-6 genome into or near a telomere may affect chromatin organisation and also telomere function. We will conduct experiments to gain insight into the rate of viral insertion and the mechanism by which HHV-6 integrates. This will be achieved in part by the isolation and characterization of viral sequences at the insertion sites from unrelated individuals. If we find evidence of common ancestry it will indicate that the viral insertion rate in the germ-line is low. To determine whether the presence of an integrated virus affects telomere function, we will compare the length of the telomere associate with the CI-HHV-6 to other telomeres in somatic cells and in the germ-line. We will explore the chromatin organisation across the integrated virus to determine whether it is silenced by epigenetic modifications and how these compare to epigenetic modification at another telomere-adjacent region. We will also seek to determine whether components of the Shelterin protein complex bind to the telomere-like repeats present within the HHV-6 genome as this may also interfere with telomere function at this chromosome end.

Epigenetic marks are more sensitive to the environment than the nucleotide sequence; yet epigenetic patterns can be transmitted through generations of cells and even through the germ line. Therefore environmental stimuli may result in permanent phenotypes. Normal DNA methylation is dependent on several micronutrients such as vitamins B6, B12 and folic acid and we aim to explore the hypothesis that variation in micronutrient supply at conception and during pregnancy could lead to changes in genomic DNA methylation. Genomic DNA samples will be analysed from individuals whose mothers received multiple and micro nutrient supplementation or from individuals whose mothers received placebo. These samples are being collected as part of a randomised double blind placebo controlled trial being carried out at the MRC field station in the Gambia. The mothers are recruited from a population which naturally undergoes cyclical patterns of maternal under nutrition and are randomised to receive either nutrient supplements or placebo prior to pregnancy. We will assess and compare total DNA cytosine methylation of the two groups using a cytosine extension assay. We will also use microarray-based methylation detection and subtractive hybridisation to compare CpG methylation profiles at a genome-wide level. In addition we will study 9 imprinting centres (ICRs) regulating gene expression in the 8 human imprinted clusters (11p15.5, 6q24, 7q12, 7q32, 14q32, 15q24, 19q13 and 20q13). Bisulphite conversion and pyrosequencing will be used to quatitatively analyse DNA methylation. DNA methylation in the two groups of individuals will be compared. DNA methylation will also be correlated with fetal and neonatal anthropometric measures as well as placental weight.	Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council	Standard grant	540198.0	GBP

The proper wiring of the mammalian nervous system is a task of unique complexity, which requires specific point-to-point connections between billions of neurons. Precision in neuron-to-target connectivity during development is achieved, in part, by the overproduction of individual neurons and synapses and the selective maintenance of only an optimal subset. Mechanistically, this Darwinian selection is best understood in the peripheral nervous system where developing neurons compete for limited amounts of survival and growth- promoting factors produced by their targets. The best characterized neurotrophin factors are the nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin 3 (NT-3) collectively known as neurotrophins. The intracellular mechanisms by which neurotrophins influence survival of developing neurons remain poorly understood. My previous studies showed that the transcription factor cAMP Response Element Binding Protein (CREB) is a crucial effector of neurotrophin action both in vitro and in vivo. It is widely believed that CREB binding to its response elements (CREs) within target gene promoters is constitutive, but I demonstrated that it is stimulus-inducible and correlates with gene transcription. I also showed that neurotrophin-dependent CREB DNA binding is regulated by a novel, nitric oxide (NO) pathway that modulates histone acetylation levels. Importantly, I found that NO regulates expression of CREB target genes in vivo in response to novel and enriched environmental (NEE) conditions, which are well known to activate the expression of CREB target genes in CNS neurons in the hippocampus and somatosensory cortex. NEE conditions have also been shown to stimulate a variety of plastic responses, including increased dendritic arborization, synaptic density, neurogenesis and memory functions, and are apparently associated with a lower incidence of neurodegenerative diseases in humans. The cell and molecular mechanisms underlying these plastic changes have not been fully elucidated but enhanced synaptic activity and increased neurotrophin signalling have been implicated. The goals of the present project are: 1) characterize neurotrophin-dependent regulation of NO signalling in neurons 2) identify the nuclear target and the nature of the post-translational modifications occurring upon neurotrophin-regulated NO synthesis 3) identify genes regulated by NO in response to NEE conditions These lines of work, investigating both the mechanisms of neurotrophin signalling to the nucleus and the gene targets of neurotrophin activation in vivo, should together provide a platform from which to understand how these crucial factors function in the establishment and maintenance of the nervous system.

Formed in 2012, CIMA has developed an integrated approach to study the effects of ageing on the musculoskeletal system, which has been demonstrably successful. CIMA has focussed activities in areas of critical mass where collaborations have provided enhanced value. These include the role of epigenetic changes in cells and tissues affected by musculoskeletal ageing, development of an assessment protocol for monitoring age-related decline in the musculoskeletal system (the CIMA Toolkit), and proof of principle pre-clinical and human studies to identify interventions that reduce the deleterious effects of ageing on the musculoskeletal system. CIMA has developed an innovative graduate training programme and undertaken well-received public engagement activities. The revised CIMA strategy will be increasingly translational, but informed by basic research. Specifically, we will; determine how epigenetic changes in the ageing musculoskeletal system influence the risk of musculoskeletal disorders, the effect of modification of epigenetic changes on musculoskeletal function, and the effect of lifestyle changes on epigenetic marks and molecules; design and implement interventions based on physical activity, nutrition, anti-inflammatory or age-retarding agents on decline of the ageing musculoskeletal system; extend the CIMA training programme to increase MRes, PhD and clinical training, and; develop engagement and impact activities to increase involvement of patients and the older population, and work with industry and other partners to maximise translation of our research discoveries. Finally, it will provide a resilience that will ensure musculoskeletal ageing moves to the centre of medical research activities within and beyond the UK.

An alternative, but poorly characterised, potential source of human variation is ?epigenetic? in nature and involves stable changes in the marks and signals that influence local gene activity. DNA methylation is known to inhibit gene expression, especially when the promoter concerned lies within a CpG island. CpG islands are predominantly unmethylated, but recent data shows that thousands become methylated in normal tissues and there is some evidence for variation between individuals. The present proposal seeks to characterise the extent of inter-individual variation in methylation of the complete human complement of 25,000 CpG islands. We will look for correlations of CpG island methylation with age, sex, and disease status in an attempt to assess the potential impact of epigenetic variability on health.

The mature oligodendrocytes (OL) are formed in the developing CNS postnatally from migratory committed progenitors, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), which also replenish the pool of OLs throughout life in the adult brain. Substantial evidence suggests that epigenetic regulation of gene expression, including gene activation and silencing, plays an important role in differentiation of OPCs to mature myelin-producing OLs. In contrast to gene activation, the full scale of epigenetically regulated gene silencing that accompanies differentiation of OPCs, and especially the role of DNA methylation in locking differentiated state, is yet to be fully established. We recently generated a unique strain of mice that are deficient in chromatin remodelling ATPase LSH, a protein implicated in developmentally programmed gene silencing, deacetylation of chromatin and de novo DNA methylation, and found that the LSH-deficient mice display substantial hypomyelination of the CNS. Our further experiments suggest that although OPCs are present in the CNS of LSH-deficient mice they fail to differentiate into mature OLs. In this project, we propose to determine the epigenetic gene silencing events that occur during differentiation of oligodendrocyte lineage cells and the molecular basis for myelin deficiency in the CNS of LSH-null mice. We also propose to examine the differentiation potential of OPCs upon LSH re-expression in young and adult brain. Such knowledge is important in order to elucidate the fundamental regulatory principles that guide differentiation of oligodendrocyte lineage cells and to direct, predict and influence the outcome of therapy for patients with CNS injury, Multiple Sclerosis and age-related neurodegenerative conditions.

By studying the architecture of these pathways we will produce computer programs that can be used to predict cancer cell growth and drug responses. Last updated / / It is becoming increasingly clear that pathways rather than individual genes govern the course of tumourigenesis. Applying this concept to tumour diagnosis and therapy demands a thorough understanding of the architecture and dynamic behaviour of oncogenic pathways. This is a 'grand challenge' in cancer research. Here we propose such a detailed analysis of the Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signalling pathway where there is compelling evidence for genetic and epigenetic modifications to pathway function in a wide variety of common tumour cell types. Our ongoing aims are: ò To use advanced proteomics and cell biology techniques to define the components of the FGF signalling pathway; its architecture; location and regulated post-translational modification. ò To deduce and predict the dynamic behaviour of the FGF signalling pathway by the creation of computational models.ò To reconstruct oncogenic manifestations of FGF signalling and test drug action scenarios in pre-malignant human cell models.This information will be applied in both diagnostic and predictive manifestations to determine alterations in the systems behaviour of the FGF pathway that occur in the context of multistep carcinogenesis and drug inhibition.

211	Professor Colin Brooks	Newcastle University	None	None	2014-12-31	Epigenetic factors controlling the expression of Ly49 receptors on immune cells	The most important function of the cells of the immune system is to recognize and destroy diseased or infected cells. The cells of the innate immune system do this in two principal ways. Myeloid-derived cells such as macrophages express receptors that directly recognize common microbial structures such as LPS. NK cells do so, at least in part, by expressing receptors that allow them to detect the reduction in expression of MHC cI molecules that frequently occurs in infected or malignant cells. In animals such as mice, a complex and diverse repertoire of NK cells is created by allowing each individual NK cell to express a small number of receptors from a pool of receptor genes that include those belonging to the Ly49 family. Until recently, this was presumed to occur through the randomized binding of certain transcription factors, present in limiting concentrations, to regulatory regions associated with receptor genes. This paradigm has been questioned by the unexpected discovery in the last year of an upstream bidirectional promoter [Pro1] associated with many of the Ly49 genes. This promoter seems to be particularly active in immature NK cells where it has been hypothesised that the direction of transcription, determined by the random mutually exclusive assembly of the transcriptional apparatus on the forward or reverse promoter elements, dictates whether the associated Ly49 gene will be activated or repressed. However, some Ly49 genes appear to lack functional Pro1 elements. In addition, the pattern of Ly49 expression varies markedly during development, and also between cell types and in response to cytokines, suggesting that additional mechanisms must be involved. One such mechanism is likely to be epigenetic changes associated with chromatin remodelling and locus accessibility. In support of this, recent studies have shown that DNA methylation may be directly involved in controlling the expression of the functionally equivalent KIR genes in humans. The aim of this project is to investigate the nature and extent of the epigenetic changes that are associated with the expression of Ly49 receptors in the mouse. Our main objectives are to map the location of DNase I hypersensitivity sites and to determine whether changes in the methylation of CpG dinucleotides and in the acetylation and methylation of histones at these or other sites are directly related to the expression of specific Ly49 genes. A key aspect of our strategy is to analyse the epigenetic status of Ly49 genes that are regulated and expressed in highly distinctive ways. In particular, we will focus primarily on three members of the Ly49 family: Ly49G, an archetypal cI receptor expressed in a stochastic manner on mature NK cells; Ly49E, which we have shown to be expressed on immature NK cells and, uniquely amongst the Ly49 family, to be induced by IL2/IL15 on mature NK cells; and Ly49B, which we have now demonstrated to be expressed in putative lymphomyeloid stem cells and in an IFN and LPS inducible manner on macrophages, but not in NK cells. As part of this project we aim map the promoter of the Ly49b gene and identify and characterize upstream sequences in this gene that might determine its tissue specificity and IFN- inducibility.

In this way PSCP will establish a leading position in the field of stem cell product development for clinical trials and its potential for industrialisation. PSCP will concentrate in-house activities on PSC and derivative tissue stem cell intermediates. However, the field in general will also benefit from tackling key knowledge gaps including: (i) establishment of standardised systems for generation of robust genetically stable human PSC populations suitable for therapeutic translation, (ii) development of genetic modification tools that bypass the risk of insertional mutagenesis and are subject to science based risk assessment, (iii) development of effective, reliable and reproducible differentiation protocols yielding functional, clinically compliant tissue-specific donor cells, (iv) quality control systems suitable for consistent manufacturing of stem cells and differentiated progeny suitable for use in human applications. The PSCP programme will address these issues through the following workpackages: i) Methods for iPSC production for clinical applications; ii) Development of a GMP-ready PSC expansion platform; iii) Assessment of the genomic and epigenomic integrity; iv) Development of protocols for production of neural progenitors; v) Development of protocols for production of endoderm lineages; vi) Product and process evaluation - integration of biology with process engineering and manufacture; vii) Safety qualification of PSC for clinical application.; viii) Process development for viable and cost-effective GMP of exemplars,notably dopaminergic and otic neurons; ix) Reproducibility and comparability.

It is well established that altered patterns of early growth, as a consequence of both in utero under-nutrition and over-nutrition are associated with increased risk of metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and obesity in later life. These conditions are major health care issues of the 21stcentury in both the developed and developing world. Therefore, understanding mechanisms by which these conditions arise and which could therefore be targeted within intervention and prevention strategies could have a major impact. Although there is strong evidence, from human and animal studies that early diet, plays an important role in mediating these relationships, the precise molecular mechanisms by which diet during critical periods of development programmes metabolism and consequently influences long-term health remain poorly defined. Permanent changes in epigenetic regulation of gene expression have emerged as an important contributing mechanism. Our previous studies demonstrated that promotor-enhancer interactions and small non-coding RNAs such as miRNAs represent key nodes of epigenetic regulation leading to modulation of expression of complex gene networks. In the current proposal, using adipose tissue from well-established mouse models of developmental programming in combination with human biopsy material, we will apply state of the art epigenetic technology including promoter-capture Hi-C with complex bioinformatic analysis, to identify changes in 4D chromatin structure that mediate programming effects. Furthermore, we will establish if non-coding RNAs represent particular “hot spots” within the genome for such regulation. We will define the function of these non-coding RNAs and promotor-enhancer interactions in vitro using a combination of primary cell cultures and adipocyte cell lines and applying CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology. Our studies will therefore define novel programming mechanisms that are conserved between rodents and humans. Any programmed epigenetic changes that we identify could, in the future, be used prognostically, diagnostically and therapeutically to target individuals at risk of metabolic disease resulting from suboptimal early life programming.

They may be derived from the B-Cell or T-cell lineage and are generally mature in nature. The prognosis of lymphomas greatly varies and is dependent on the stage and histology of the disease. Although up to 60% of young patients (<60y) with aggressive Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) are cured by combination immune-chemotherapy, older patients have a fairly dismal outlook. However, low-grade indolent disease such as Follicular lymphoma (FL are commonly incurable. Worryingly, the incidence of malignant lymphomas continues to rise, and at 3-4% increase per year appears far in excess of what would be expected simply from the ageing of the population. The identification of critical mediators of lymphomagenesis and novel therapies that target them is therefore a priority for this increasingly common malignancy and unmet medical need. To address these questions, we will use unique mouse models that we have developed engineering in the ability to generate and record further progression events through insertional mutagenesis, specifically within B-cells. This system will allow us to robustly answer the question of the contribution of the initial cell-type to outcome and phenotype of lymphoma. Using the presence of a unique premalignant phase within the model, we will also characterize alterations of transcription, epigenetic state and signaling that occur during lymphoma evolution, through a combination of single cell and bulk RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq and ATATC-Seq, promoter based capture HiC and intracellular flow cytometry. Finally we will test a priori hypotheses about the requirement for specific DNA repair pathways and residual CREBBP/P300 function in these Crebbp-/- lymphomas, as well as performing a genomewide CRISPR/Cas9 dropout screen to identify further genotype-specific vulnerabilities, a subset of which will be further tested in our in vivo model.

They display a complex pattern of variants and recent data suggest that they may have specific roles in epigenetic control of gene expression. The cell cycle dependent phosphorylation of certain serine and threonine residues in the charged tails of the linker histones is most probably of major importance in determining the architecture of chromatin during cell proliferation and differentiation, but the molecular details of this process are very unclear. Aberrant chromatin structure may contribute to malignant transformation and tumour formation. This project aims at elucidating these mechanisms by combining the expertise of Herbert Lindner?s laboratory in Innsbruck and Jean Thomas? laboratory in Cambridge, in collaboration with Ingemar Rundquist?s laboratory in Linkoping. All three research groups have many years? experience in linker histone research and the laboratories complement each other well, offering a large range of methods and techniques in analytical chemistry, structural biology, biophysics, and cytochemistry. Together, these investigations should contribute to increased understanding of epigenetic mechanisms involved in chromatin architecture, regulation of cell growth and differentiation, and in malignant transformation and tumour progression.

We will apply tailored small molecules as tools and drug candidates in intracellular signalling. Multidisciplinary chemical biology will be driven, often with expert collaborators, by a unique focus on synthetic chemistry with structural biology, spectroscopy, computational chemistry, imaging, electrophysiology and enzymology. We will interrogate, ideally in atomic detail, roles of lower and higher inositol phosphates (IPs), phosphoinositides (PIs) and newer messengers cyclic adenosine 5-diphosp hate ribose (cADPR), adenosine 5-diphosphate ribose (ADPR) and nicotinic acid adenine diphosphate ribose 2-phosphate (NAADP). Key goals reflect two areas of equal endeavour: For IP/PIs: to illuminate how inositol trisphosphate activates its receptor, design and exploit specific agonists, partial agonists and antagonists, also with cellular permeability; we will unravel the structure-activity relationship (SAR) and therapeutic potential of an epigenetic histone deacetylase coregulator with IP surrogates to substitute and inhibit at the binding site; mechanistic and modulatory tools will target lipid phosphatases, explore the origins, significance and targets of IP5 and IP6, and the enigmatic higher IP7 and IP8; using structural biology we will develop our simplified synthetic surrogates for relevant enzymes and against IP-dependent bacterial exotoxins. For cADPR/ADPR/NAADP: stable synthetic templates will provide tools to identify the cADPR receptor in diverse systems and rational ise complex SAR; synthetic nucleotides will define the first agonist-antagonist TRPM2 SAR for ADPR to explore a therapeutic approach using a permeant ADPR-agonist; designed tools will address the NAADP receptor/binding protein with our first generation synthetic antagonist iterated towards disease models; structure-based inhibitor design for CD38 cyclase will be exploited to manipulate signalling pathways.

Mechanisms that lead to the establishment and maintenance of cell identity are paramount for organismal health. They also underpin successful cellular reprogramming for disease modelling and cell replacement therapies. We will investigate the roles played by the epigenome and co-factors in regulating lineage transcription factor-mediated establishment and stabilisation of cell fate in vivo and in vitro. Firstly, controlled activation and degradation of engineered transcription factors (TFs) will be used to challenge cell identity in developing frog embryos. We will compare transcriptional profiles and chromatin landscape in “permissive” tissues that respond to TF over-expression by undergoing full lineage reprogramming, and “non-permissive” tissues that resist reprogramming, as well as probing heterogeneity of transcriptional response in individual cells. Secondly, mechanisms responsible for differential response to TF will be identified through interference with the epigenome as well as via alteration of the co-factors repertoire present in embryonic tissue. Finally, we will explore mechanisms underlying lineage fidelity in mammalian ES cells that have been engineered to co-express TFs specifying conflicting lineages. Overall, this work will reveal how the response to lineage determining TFs is controlled by integration of epigenetic features and co-factor availability in both the developing embryo and in reprogrammed mammalian cells.

219	Dr Miguel Constancia	University of Cambridge	None	None	2023-09-30	Epigenetic regulation of gene expression as a mechanism of nutritional programming and developmental origins of health and disease	The human baby responds and adapts to the nutrients it receives during gestation and lactation in a variety of ways. These adaptations include metabolic and endocrine changes that may lead to life-long changes in the function and structure the body - a concept which has been termed fetal programming. The suggestion is that the baby receives from its mother a forecast of the nutritional environment it will receive after birth and modifies its metabolism, whole body physiology and growth trajectory appropriately to maximise its chances of survival postnatally. However these adaptations become detrimental if the conditions after birth are not the same as the ones encountered during early life. The inappropriate programming results in a considerably higher susceptibility to developing chronic diseases of adult life. This Developmental Origins of Health and Disease hypothesis proposes that disorders such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes may result from an imbalance between the environment experienced in utero and that experienced postnatally. This hypothesis has been supported by numerous epidemiological studies which have shown an association between low birth weight and later disease and also by studies in animals. The dominant research focus to date has been the defining of the physiological adaptations and metabolic changes in both human and animal studies. However, very few studies have addressed the molecular mechanisms by which a phenomenon that occurs in utero has a phenotypic consequence many years later. Epigenetics refers to covalent modifications of DNA and core histones which are heritable and affect genome function (transcription, recombination, replication) without altering the nucleotide sequence of DNA. Epigenetic mechanisms are essential for development and differentiation and create a memory" of cell identity. Importantly, epigenetic modifications can be modulated by nutritional factors and can act as reversible switches of gene expression to heritably maintain specific genomic regions in a transcriptionally silent or active state. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is therefore an attractive candidate mechanism for fetal programming because it confers and maintains cellular "memory" for many cell divisions. The aim of this proposal is to establish a mechanistic link between maternal diet during pregnancy, epigenetic states of the genome and the developmental origins of adult disease. Using an integrated approach combining molecular biology, whole animal nutritional programming and functional genomics, epigenomics on a defined cell type, the pancreatic beta cell, we will address the following issues. Firstly, we will establish if the epigenetic state of the genome can be altered due to nutritional programming in utero and if such changes can explain programmed changes in gene expression. Secondly, we will identify the critical time windows by which epigenetic memory and gene activity are established by fetal programming. Finally, we will manipulate DNA methylation of key metabolic genes in vitro and profile the transcriptional and metabolic consequences. We will achieve these aims using our well established maternal protein restriction model of fetal programming. Understanding the mechanisms involved in intrauterine nutritional programming could ultimately lead to diagnosis, prevention and potential treatment of long term effects of maternal diet on adult health."

221	Dr Peter Fraser	Babraham Institute	None	2014-02-01	2019-02-01	Chromosome structure and genome organization in early mammalian development	The spatial organization of the genome inside the cell nucleus is tissue-specific and has been linked to several nuclear processes including gene activation, gene silencing, genomic imprinting, gene co-regulation, genome maintenance, DNA replication, DNA repair, chromosomal translocations and X chromosome inactivation. In fact, just about any nuclear/genome function has a spatial component that has been implicated in its control. We know surprisingly little about chromosome conformation and spatial organization or how they are established. The extent to which they are a cause or consequence of genome functions are current topics of considerable debate, however emerging data from my group and many other groups world-wide indicate that nuclear location and organization are drivers of genome functions, which in cooperation with other features including epigenetic marks, non-coding RNAs and trans-factor binding bring about genome control. Thus, genome spatial organization can be considered on a par with other epigenetic features that together contribute to overall genome control. The classical paradigm of early mammalian development arguably represents the most dramatic and yet least understood process of genome reprogramming, where a single cell undergoes a series of divisions to ultimately give rise to the hundreds of different cell types found in a mature organism. Study of pre-implantation embryo development is hindered by the very nature of the life form, composed of extremely low cell numbers at each stage, which severely limits the options for investigation. My lab has recently developed a novel technique called single cell Hi-C, which has the power to detect tens of thousands of simultaneous chromatin contacts from a single cell. In this application I propose to apply this technology to study chromosome structure and genome organization during mouse pre-implantation development along with single cell transcriptome analyses from the same cells.

At present no effective therapeutic strategies exist to prevent AC. AC is an active process associated with vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotype switching. Cell phenotype is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms including chromatin remodelling. We have evidence that the bromodomain containing protein Brd9 regulates calcification and therefore represents a novel therapeutic target. This project will identify Brd9 regulated genes, confirm whether the role of Brd9 in calcification is through the chromatin remodelling BAF complex and determine the changes in histone acetylation that direct Brd9:DNA interactions. We will test the efficacy of the novel small molecule inhibitors JQ1 and IBrd-9, a pan-Brd and a Brd9 specific inhibitor respectively, in preventing calcification both in a novel organoid model and in vivo.

Plaque rupture involves extracellular matrix destruction associated with elevated numbers of macrophages, up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and down-regulation of tissue inhibitor of MMPs-3 (TIMP-3). We recently showed that monocyte to macrophage differentiation and classical macrophage activation up-regulates several MMPs and reduces TIMP-3. Greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms could allow translation of these findings to treatments. Activation of known transcription factors, including AP-1, SAF-1 and NF-?B, provides only a limited explanation. Bioinformatics and preliminary experiments suggest that epigenetic mechanisms could be of crucial importance. The present application is to support a definitive test of this hypothesis.

While not a major player in that condition we have gone on to report HirA protein interactions with bicoid homeodomain transcription factors and histone H3.3, clone the Fugu and Drosophila homologues, and created a targeted mutation of HirA in mouse. With Tom Misteli we recently showed altered chromatin dynamics and differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells. Other groups have shown, in a variety of organisms, that Hira is involved in cellular senescence, chromatin remodelling immediately post fertilization, and epigenetic control of gene expression. HirA is required for embryonic viability with embryos dying shortly after gastrulation. This makes it exceeding difficult to define the role of Hira is specific developmental processes, senescence at the level of the whole organism, and even examine the cell cycle due to inability to culture mouse embryonic fibroblasts successfully. We request support to create a conditional mutation of the HirA gene in order to identify the timing requirements for HirA during development using a ubiquitously expressed, tamoxifen inducible, Cre. The targeting strategy will borrow heavily from our successful creation of a constitutive null allele and single loxP knock in (for chromosome engineering). We will create MEFs and analyse the cell cycle and cellular senescence in the absence of HirA. Following on from our observations concerning Hira expression and the phenotype of the constitutive null, we will examine the requirements for Hira specifically in the developing heart and neural crest. Given the recent interest in Hira from various quarters, we will immediately make mice available to a number of groups who have expertise in specific areas and where it would be unrealistic for us to propose equivalent experiments in a three year time frame.

Evidence indicates that intrauterine exposure to maternal diabetes leads to increased risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity and diabetes in the offspring, possibly mediated by epigenetic changes. Preliminary analysis of Generation Scotland (GS) data suggested that subjects without diabetes whose mothers have diabetes have higher glucose and cholesterol levels than control groups (only father or neither parent with diabetes). We plan a study of GS subjects, with record linkage to SMR02 from Information Services Division for pregnancy details and SCI-DC from the Scottish Diabetes Research Network for diabetes details. This strategy will confirm which subjects had intrauterine exposure to maternal diabetes, allowing comparison of subjects with the same control groups to determine whether a specific phenotype associated with intrauterine exposure to diabetes exists into adulthood. These results will have implications for management of diabetes in pregnancy and subsequent health surveillance of offspring.	Chief Scientist Office	FULL GRANT	59230.0	GBP

The focus of this programme of research is the family of EBV-encoded nuclear proteins (EBNAs 3A, 3B and 3C) expressed in the type of viral latency generally associated with EBV-driven B cell proliferation. Although the EBNA3s are vital to EBV biology, our knowledge of their functions was until recently quite limited, but they are gradually moving centre stage. Using a series of unique, engineered recombinant viruses carrying a variety of mutations in the EBNA3 locus and microarray technology, we have discovered a remarkably large number of cell genes regulated by one or more of the EBNA3 proteins. Regulation in some cases involves stable epigenetic changes to chromatin and in some involves transcriptional elongation. Furthermore it is now clear at least one of these proteins (EBNA3C) additionally targets multiple cellular proteins involved in the regulation of cell cycle checkpoints. Key aims of the study are: a) To fully characterise the molecular mechanisms underpinning EBNA3 actio n and cooperation in gene regulation. b) To clarify the roles of the EBNA3s in cell cycle deregulation. c) To explore their contribution in lymphomagenesis using a small animal model. d) To understand their contribution to human disease involving EBV.

This will give insights into the processes that enable these organisms to enter a quiescent state that protects them from both immunological and chemotherapeutic intervention, and also provide novel targets against which to develop new drugs. Specifically, we aim to characterise the range and extent of post-translational modifications to proteins (specifically histones) involved in chromatin formation in Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania infantum and L. mexicana cells undergoing passage through the life cycle and in response to metabolic pertubations. This will involve the isolation of chromatin from different parasite lifecycle stages, and isolation of the individual proteins of the complex (using immunopreciptation methodologies with antibodies specific for the trypanosomatid histones, and BioID approaches to identify neighbouring members of the complex). Proteomic approaches will determine the repertoire of proteins involved. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) on individual proteins will be assessed using specific antibodies and also mass spectrometry of digested proteins to seek mass changes consistent with different PTMs. The abundance of individual metabolites in cells at different cell/lifecycle stages will be determined using LC-MS based untargeted metabolomics. CRISPR/cas9 approaches will allow rapid knockout of non-essential enzymes producing metabolites implicated in PTM, and use of different metabolic substrates will also be used to modulate their abundance to asses impact on epigenetic change and gene transcription by RNAseq.

However, effects are modulated by dietary and other factors and human studies of this polymorphism and breast cancer risk have produced conflicting results. We propose to use transfection technology to generate a model of this polymorphism in a non-cancer breast epithelial cell (HMT 3522S1). The model will be validated and characterised. This will be the first transfection of the wild-type ans mutant 677T MTHFR cDNA into a non-cancer breast cell line and will allow investigations into the functional phenotype of this polymorphism (differential metabolic profiling, supported by targeted proteomic and epigenetic investigations), that will help to explain its effect on breast cancer risk. Additionally the model will be used to test hypotheses relating to interactions between the polymorphism and dietary factors that determine breast cancer risk.	Breast Cancer Now	Pilot	None	None

It is well established that patterns of early growth are associated with risk of metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and obesity in later life, conditions which are major health care issues of the 21stcentury in both the developed and developing world. Strong evidence, from human and animal studies suggests that the early environment, including early diet, plays an important role in mediating these relationships. However the precise molecular mechanisms by which diet during critical periods of development programmes metabolism and consequently influences long-term health remain poorly defined. Permanent changes in epigenetic regulation of gene expression have emerged as an important contributing mechanism. Our recent studies demonstrated that transcription factors and miRNAs represent key nodes of epigenetic regulation leading to modulation of expression of complex gene networks. Our recent findings also demonstrated (using the Hnf4a gene as a candidate locus) that changes in promoter-enhancer interactions induced by changes in epigenetic modifications represented a novel programming mechanism. Furthermore we demonstrated that the dynamics of the age-associated changes in these modifications was modified by early nutrition. In the current proposal, using adipose tissue from a well-established rat model of developmental programming and state of the art epigenetic technology including promoter-capture Hi-C, we will test our hypothesis that modulation of promoter-enhancer interactions is a common mechanism underlying developmental programming and that non-coding RNAs represent particular “hot spots” within the genome for such regulation. We will define the function of these non-coding RNAs in vitro using a combination of primary cell cultures and adipocyte cell lines and in the longer-term transgenic mouse technology. To confirm that the programmed changes identified in the animal model are conserved between rats and humans, we will quantify the programmed epigenetic changes in adipose tissue biopsies from an extensively characterised cohort of control and low birth weight young men. We will then determine if these programmed changes are also present in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the same individuals. Any programmed epigenetic changes that are translated to such a clinically accessible tissue could, in the future, be used prognostically, diagnostically and therapeutically to target individuals at risk of metabolic disease resulting from suboptimal early life programming. The findings could therefore help combat the growing burden of complex diseases such as type 2 diabetes.	Medical Research Council	Unit	None	None

Adult stem cells are required for tissue homeostasis and for the development of organs. In the mammary gland, stem cells are required during embryonic development and in the pubertal female for the development of the branching ductal network. Stem cells are required during each pregnancy to provide the progenitor cells that differentiate into the milk-producing lobuloalveolar units. There are at least four mammary epithelial lineages although the mammary epithelial hierarchy is not well defined and there are no definitive stem or progenitor cell markers. Essential regulators of the luminal alveolar lineage have recently been identified and include GATA-3, a zinc finger transcription factor, and Elf5. We have shown recently that Stat6, a regulator of GATA-3, is required for unhindered alveologenesis as mice deficient for either Stat6 or its activating cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 display up to 70 percent reduction in the number of alveoli during early gestation. We have identified a novel target of Stat6 that we hypothesise is a master regulator of alveologenesis and named this gene Roma. Bioinformatic analysis reveadled that ROMA is a KRAB domain zinc finger protein and a putative transcriptional repressor. The aim of this project is to characterise ROMA further and define its role in lineage commitment in mammary gland using mice with loss of function of ROMA and stem and progenitor cell analysis using FACS analysis and fat pad transfer. In addition, we will identify transcriptional targets of ROMA, the pathways that interact with ROMA, and the epigenetic status of the Roma promoter as other lineage regulators such as Elf5 are epigentically regulated.

237	Dr Peter Fraser	Babraham Institute	None	None	2013-06-11	The role of non-coding RNAs in epigenetic regulation of gene expression	Non-coding RNAs are emergent players in an expanding number of roles in epigenetic regulation of gene expression, though in many cases their precise function remains enigmatic. The pre-eminent example of one class of functional RNAs is the non-coding Xist RNA which is essential for random X chromosome inactivation in mammalian female cells. Xist is a 17 kb RNA encoding by the Xist gene on the X chromosome. In undifferentiated ES cells Xist gene expression is biallelic. During the first few days of ES cell differentiation Xist expression is downregulated on the future active X chromosome and Xist RNA from the future inactive X is upregulated. Xist proceeds to 'coat' or 'paint' the future inactive X leading to the recruitment of chromatin modifying complexes, which epigenetically silence gene expression from the entire chromosome. Little is known about the identity of these complexes and even less is known about how Xist spreads over the entire chromosome or which specific sequences it interacts with. Two other non-coding RNAs that have recently gained precedence are the Air and Kcnq1ot1 (Lit1) RNAs. Both RNAs are expressed from clusters of imprinted genes. Air is 108 kb in length and transcribed in the antisense direction from an intronic promoter within the Igf2r gene (insulin-like growth factor II receptor) on mouse chromosome 17. Similarly Kcnq1ot1 is approximately 100 kb in length and is transcribed in the antisense direction from an intron of the Kcnq1 gene (Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily KQT member 1) on mouse chromosome 7. Both are expressed from the paternal allele only and appear to be necessary to silence several other imprinted genes in their respective clusters. In this project we will characterize the behaviour of the Air and Kcnq1ot1 RNAs in tissues in which they are required for imprinted expression of their neighboring genes and in tissues without imprinted expression of genes in their clusters. Our preliminary data suggests that Air may silence imprinted genes in cis via a spreading or coating mechanism, similar to Xist in X inactivation. The relatively small size of the genomic region over which Air exerts its influence compared to Xist, makes it an ideal system to study possible interactions at the molecular level. We will attempt to identify specific genomic sequences through which Air and Kcnq1ot1 exert their control over imprinted gene clusters. We will perform similar experiments on the Xist RNA to identify its sites of interaction with regions of the inactive X chromosome in female mouse cells. Together these three non- coding RNAs epigenetically regulate hundreds of genes. Given that it is now recognized that non-coding transcripts represent the clear majority of the transcribed regions of mammalian genomes, it is likely that non-coding RNA control is a much more widespread phenomenon in epigenetic regulation than previously appreciated.

We have also established the MUP lipocalin ligands as integral to this developmental regenerative process. This matches to the biology since VNO access to these non-volatile ligands occurs via oral and genital nuzzling. The aims and objectives of this project are:- 1) Establish co-cultures of VNO stem cells with target neurons in tissue slices from the accessory olfactory bulb in order to address questions of axonal outgrowth and the interactive mechanisms between VNO and AOB for axonal targetting of AOB. 2) Address the importance of receptor signalling for this process. V2Rs are linked via Galpha-o to activate phospholipase cb-2 to generate DAG and IP3 which link to TRPc2 channels for calcium entry. We will investigate the importance of activity dependent signalling through this pathway for axonal growth and targetting. We have access to the TRPc2 mutant for this study. 3) Since the MUP proteins have the capacity to sustain and proliferate the stem cell population of VNO receptor neurons and the same MUP ligands also participate in pheromone signalling, we will investigate the epigenetic effects of signalling on the regenerative process and how this influences life history changes in pheromone receptors according to need.

The placenta which is genetically foetal, serves to regulate maternal endocrinology and physiology in order to optimise transfer of resources to the foetus and at the same time ensure changes occur in the mothers behaviour to meet infant demands in the pre- and post-partum period. Interactions across mother-infant phenotypes involving the maternal hypothalamus, foetal placenta and developing foetal hypothalamus provide a template for co-adaptive selection pressures to operate. The evolutionary outcome of this linked co-adaptation is that offspring that have extracted good" maternal nurturing both pre- and post-natally would themselves be well provisioned for early reproduction and, in the case of the females, genetically predisposed towards good mothering when adult. Maternally imprinted genes which are paternally expressed have played a crucial role in this co- adaptive development of mother and offspring. Transgenerational interactions across maternal hypothalamus, foetal placenta and foetal hypothalamus, all regulated by the same imprinted haploid dominant allele not only provide a template for mother-infant co-adaptive evolution, but this template is also amenable to environmental perturbation of the kind on which foetal programming for adult behaviour and physiological homeostasis may depend. In this project, we will investigate the co-ordinated expression of key imprinted genes in the placenta and developing foetal hypothalamus at the time foetal energy requirements start to impose a substantial demand on mother. We will determine gene networks, their similarities and differences in the developing hypothalamus and placenta through perturbations to this network using mice with mutation of imprinted genes (Peg3). These are likely to be candidate networks for epigenetic dysregulation in foetal programming."	Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council	Standard grant	313637.0	GBP

Folate is required for transferring one carbon units in the de novo synthesis of purines and pyrimidines and DNA methylation. MTHFR catalyses the reduction of 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5- methyltetrahydrofolate. Low levels of 5, 10- methylenetetrahydrofolate results in decreased synthesis of thymidine and increased uracil misincorporation into DNA, which can result in DNA strand breaks and chromosomal damage. Low levels of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, the methyl donor for the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine in the methylation cycle, may disrupt normal patterns of DNA methylation, an epigenetic event that is involved in regulating gene expression. The MTHFR 677 C to T mutation results in a thermolabile enzyme with decreased activity and is a well established genetic determinant of hyperhomocysteinemia. Observational studies have reported that individuals homozygous for the mutation (TT) have decreased global DNA methylation in leucocytes, with the interaction dependent on folate status. However, the MTHFR 677C to T mutation appears to protect against colorectal cancer when folate status is adequate. It has been hypothesised that in the absence of low folate status the mutation does not compromise DNA methylation but increases DNA stability by sequestering 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate for thymidine synthesis, leading to more efficient DNA synthesis and a decrease in uracil misincorporation into DNA. To date there have been no studies to address this hypothesis in the colon of healthy volunteers. The aim of the proposed project is to assess the influence of the MTHFR 677C to T mutation on DNA methylation patterns and uracil misincorporation in the colon of subjects without colorectal neoplasia and to determine whether increasing folate status can influence these parameters according to MTHFR 677 C to T genotype. Specific aims. 1. To determine whether the MTHFR 677C to T mutation is associated with DNA methylation and uracil misincorporation in the colon of healthy volunteers. 2. To determine whether increasing folate intake in healthy individuals can modify DNA methylation and uracil misincorporation in the colon and whether the response differs according to MTHFR 677C to T genotype. 3. To determine whether changes in CpG island methylation of specific genes are associated with corresponding changes in gene expression and whether the MTHFR 677C to T mutation influences the expression of folate-related genes.

In this project we will use time course data from stimulated primary human T-cells to uncover the regulatory function of RA-associated enhancers controlling target gene expression. Capture-HiC data enriched for promoters and disease-associated enhancers will be used to identify the physical interactions between enhancers and promoters and how these change through time. Nuclear RNA-Seq will be used to quantify nascent transcription. ATAC-Seq will be used to profile open chromatin and identify likely transcription factor binding (TF) events. We will collect data from these three assays from the same primary T-cell population over a 24 hour time period after stimulation. We will then use these data to develop a regulatory network model, using non-parametric Gaussian process methods to infer TF activities and mathematical models to describe the effect of TF-binding on promoter activity and nascent RNA production rates. We will score alternative regulatory network models through Bayesian model comparison in order to identify the most well-supported models of regulation for each target gene. Computational methods will be scaled up from previous smaller scale applications to deal with more complex enhancer-driven regulation involving large numbers of regulatory TFs. Methods will be published as open source computational tools for the community. Finally, we will validate our predictions through follow-up experiments on human data by comparing subjects with differences in SNPs implicated through our model-based analysis. We will use targeted ChIP-PCR to look at the effect of these SNPs on epigenetic marks and TF binding and targeted 3C to confirm enhancer-promoter interactions and look at whether these are altered according to genetic differences.

Diet and lifestyle factors are thought to alter the epigenetic profile of normal cells in a way which predisposes to the development of cancer. We hypothesise that the epigenetic status of normal systemic cells is predictive of breast cancer risk and that epigenetic status is influenced by diet and lifestyle. This hypothesis will be tested in a breast cancer case-control study of 1,000 women with information on diet, lifestyle, alcohol use, physical activity and clinical status. Epigenetic status will be measured in buccal cells using a genome wide scan of 25,000 promoter regions in 60 cases and 60 controls with detailed analysis of 16 selected candidate genes in all 1,000 subjects by pyrosequencing. We will determine; 1) whether the epigenetic status of healthy systemic cells is predictive of breast cancer risk, 2) which genes are epigenetically altered; 3) which lifestyle factors (e.g. diet, physical activity, BMI) are predictive of a 'high breast cancer risk' epigenetic profile?

What is lacking is an understanding of the underlying dynamic processes operating in the human germline that create this variation. We will address this by direct mechanistic analyses, using single DNA molecule methods largely pioneered in our laboratory to access rare events. In a continuation of work currently funded by the MRC, we will extend our exploration of meiotic recombination. Specific goals include the characterisation of the most intense recombination hotspots in the human genome and their use to investigate recombination initiation and processing, to test whether recombination is mutagenic, and to identify DNA sequence and epigenetic factors that control hotspot activity and influence recombination outcome. This work will be extended to investigating ectopic recombination between repeated DNA sequences, with particular focus on unequal exchange operating within gene families, a major driver of pathological DNA rearrangements. Specific issues include the balance between mitotic and meiotic recombination, the rules governing duplication and deletion, the identification of elements that control exchange and the relationship between allelic and ectopic recombination. Information on germline dynamics will be used to explore levels of selection operating within human populations on loci that show copy number variation. We will also develop new approaches to investigate directly the dynamics and processes of spontaneous deletion in the human germline, to characterise de novo transposition events in human sperm, and most challengingly to detect de novo base substitutions and to characterise factors such as germline lineage structure and germcell selection that can influence mutation load. This work will generate new methods for monitoring de novo heritable mutation and will yield fundamental insights into sequence turnover in the human germline and the origin of pathological variants. Without this knowledge, we will never fully understand human DNA variation nor forces such as selection that operate at the population level to create patterns of contemporary human DNA diversity.

We study somitic muscle growth and regeneration in vivo using zebrafish larvae expressing genetic reporters by 3D time-lapse confocal microscopy using molecular genetics, physiological recordings and manipulations and a variety of molecular analytical approaches. We have developed a short-term quantitative growth assay and shown that muscle contraction is necessary for normal larval muscle growth. We have identified distinct muscle precursor cells that reside in different somite regions, participate differently in muscle growth and repair and express different muscle stem cell markers. We have three Specific Aims: 1. To distinguish the role of force and activity on muscle growth. By using our rapid growth assay that gives high content data of great precision combined with next generation sequencing and genome editing, we will determine the time course, perdurance and molecular nature of the growth stimulus. 2. To determine the function of stem/precursor cell diversity in muscle growth. By following the behaviour of individual cells and cell clones as they contribute to growth after specific cellular and genetic manipulations we will distinguish the contribution and mechanism(s) controlling a) new fibre formation, b) cell fusion to pre-existing fibres and c) increase in fibre volume during muscle growth. 3. To analyse the cellular and molecular control of muscle wound repair. By applying the above approaches, we will determine the similarities and differences between normal muscle growth and reactive regeneration from the same populations of cells. Using our past experience with a wide range of model organisms and human myogenesis, we are engaging with clinicians to refine our studies and explore the significance of our findings in the context of human health.

The results of recent human and animal studies have provided strong evidence for the epigenetic effects of a dietary deficiency of methyl donors on cancer risk and some other common diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying the links between epigenetic alterations and disease remain elusive. Given that the development of cancer is a multistep process of mutation accumulation, it is plausible that the reported long-term changes in the pattern of DNA methylation following dietary restriction may destabilise the genome. Relevance to cancer. The proposed research aims to establish the long-term epigenetic effects of a folate-deficient diet on genome stability, patterns of DNA methylation and gene expression in treated mice and their offspring, and could elucidate the unknown mechanisms underlying such changes. An in depth analysis of the mechanisms underlying the links between environmentally-induced epigenetic changes and disease could substantially improve the identification of the determinants of cancer. A better understanding of the pattern of transmission of epigenetic changes should provide experimentally based estimates of the delayed epigenetic effects of exposure to a broad range of environmental factors, of direct relevance to cancer research. This work could ultimately improve early diagnostic testing for aberrant DNA methylation that can lead to cancer. Aims: (i) to establish whether a folate-deficient diet results in long-term changes in mutation rate in treated mice and their offspring; (ii) to establish whether a folate-deficient diet can alter the pattern of DNA methylation in treated mice and their offspring; (iii) to establish whether a folate-deficient diet affects gene expression in treated mice and their offspring. Plan of research. Male mice will be maintained for 12 weeks on a folate-deficient diet. To establish the effects of diet on mutation induction and transgenerational instability, the frequency of mutation at an expanded simple tandem repeat (ESTR) locus will be determined in the treated mice 0-12 weeks after dietary exposure and in their offspring. Using the MeDIP assay, the methylation status of mouse gene promoters will be established. To investigate whether epigenetic methylation changes are heritable, the patterns of DNA methylation will also be assessed in the offspring of treated mice. Using microarrays, the expression profiles of the same control and treated animals will also be analysed, addressing the following questions: (i) do diet-related alterations in the epigenetic landscape affect the expression profiles of methyl-deficient animals? (ii) do paternal dietary deficiencies affect gene expression in their offspring?	Cancer Research UK	Project Award	None	None

Recently, we have identified a signalling switch which controls the onset of neuronal differentiation and patterning in new neural tissue as it is generated in the embryo by a tail-end stem zone. This involves mutual opposition of Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signalling, which promotes an undifferentiated cell state, and Retinoid signalling, which drives differentiation. Here I plan to build on this discovery and on new data which identify dramatic changes in cell cycle parameters and in epigenetic modification which prefigure the establishment of regulated neuron production. These maturation events will be investigated in detail in the embryo and in ES cells. Specifically, I plan to: i) Identify regulatory relationships between key signalling pathways that maintain the undifferentiated cell state in the tail-end stem zone; ii) characterise changes in cell cycle parameters and regulation as cells leave the stem zone, experience retinoid signalling and commence neuron production; iii) Investigate epigenetic events associated with changes in cell cycle which may underpin onset of neuron production; iv) Search for similar regulatory relationships, cell cycle and epigenetic changes in mouse ES cells undergoing neural/neuronal differentiation; v) Use GeneChip and accompanying bioinformatics approaches to identify key changes in gene expression in stem zone cells exposed to retinoic acid; vi) Develop a transgenic mouse in which gene expression is driven specifically in the tail end, to open the way to genetic investigation of differentiation in the embryonic neural axis. The overall aim of this work is thus to establish key signalling networks and regulatory mechanisms which govern the differentiation status of cells in newly generated neural tissue in the embryo, which we will use to inform our investigations of these processes during in vitro differentiation of ES cells.

The Centre for Musculoskeletal Ageing Research (CMAR) integrates the work of world class researchers, clinicians and health professionals at the Universities of Birmingham, Nottingham and Oxford to focus on understanding: 1. The age-related loss of musculoskeletal mass and function, including the role played by lifestyle (diet, physical inactivity) in influencing the trajectory of this process. Mechanisms such as anabolic resistance, autophagy, neuromuscular decline and cell senescence are key mechanisms being investigated; 2. How ageing influences musculoskeletal disease pathogenesis and frailty. This will include determining: whether ageing is accelerated in Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other chronic inflammatory conditions using epigenetic marks indicative of biological ageing, the role of the gut microbiome in musculoskeletal health and disease, the role of anti-inflammatory pathways and their dysregulation in ageing and RA, the factors driving the sarcopaenia secondary to common chronic inflammatory diseases (COPD, IBD) and physical trauma. 3. Physical activity and diet-based interventions will continue to be assessed and validated in healthy elders and patients, ensuring protocols are tailored to adults of differing ability. Metabolomics will be used to help RA patient stratification for therapy and biomedical engineers and neuroscience researchers will test novel methods to improve tissue regeneration and motor control respectively. CMAR will continue to apply its internationally recognised expertise in motivational psychology to develop programmes achieving good adherence in adults, including patients with arthritis and chronic inflammatory conditions. CMAR will also place emphasis on collaborative working, supporting students and early career researchers to make collaborative visits of up to 1 year to other centres of excellence in the UK or overseas.

However, it has long been recognised that a key component of this process is the accompanying changes in the extracellular matrix and stromal cells which are essential for cancer invasion and a pre-requisite for the formation of secondary tumours. Endol 80 is a multidomain endocytic tansmembrane receptor. The restricted cell type distribution of Endol 80 and its upregulation in the tumour microenvironment, together with data demonstrating that this constitutively recycling receptor can bind and internalize collagens, interact with the uPA/uPAR protease system and promote both cell migration and chemotaxis has led us to propose a role for Endol 80 in both normal and pathological tissue remodelling. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo assays, we will seek to address two key issues in this proposal, (1) what is the mechanism by which Endol 80 promotes cell migration ad chemotaxis and in particular how does this endocytic receptor integrate into the signalling pathways activated in response to growth factors or the extracellular matrix, and (2) what is the effect of stromal Endol 80 expression in promoting an invasive phenotype in tumour cells.

249	Prof Elena Klenova	University of Essex	Biological Sciences	2005-10-03	2008-10-02	Role of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in epigenetic control	Epigenetic modifications are reversible alterations in gene expression that occur without permanent changes in DNA sequence. Recent findings demonstrate that specialized DNA elements, termed insulators, play an important role in the establishment of epigenetic marks. Chromatin insulators set up boundaries that antagonize enhancer-promoter communications in a position-dependent manner. In vertebrates, this feature involves the 11 zinc finger protein CTCF as a common denominator. Although a growing body of evidence shows that chromatin insulators are important regulators of expression domains and networks, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying insulator action. Our recent findings documented the genome-wide link between insulation/imprinting and poly-ADP(ribosyl)ation, pointing to CTCF as a target for poly-ADP( ribosyl)ation. (Yu et al, 2004, Nature Genetics, in press). The main goal of the proposed project is to gain further insight into molecular mechanisms of the regulation of insulators by poly-ADP(ribosyl)ation. To achieve this goal we propose to investigate the following objectives:(i) Perform a detailed analysis of biochemical properties of the poly-ADP( ribosyl)ated form of CTCF; (ii) Undertake functional tests to study the role of poly-ADP( ribosyl)ation of CTCF in the control of the beta-globin insulator and the chromatin insulator at the H19 imprinting control region; (iii) Investigate whether there are any other poly-(ADP ribosyl)ated candidate proteins participating in the control of the insulator at the H19 imprinting control region and also identify any additional associated proteins. Biochemical techniques such as assays of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase, polymer analysis, protein chromatograpy, Western blotting and electrophoresis (one and two-dimensional) will be used in combination with various cell/tissue culture methods. Confocal microscopy will be important to monitor expression and localization of proteins, and flow cytometry will be used for an insulator assay. This project will also involve analysis of proteins by mass-spectromety. The knowledge, technology and materials generated during this study will be made avaliable to reserchers in the UK and overseas with interests in genetic and epigenetic regulation. We expect that at the later stage private companies and government agencies are very likely to benefit from this study.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	217053.0	GBP

While some components of the cerebral cortical areal specialization are determined by differential patterns of commitment at an early stage, there is considerable evidence that developing cortex is partly multipotential and that a localized extrinsic signal is needed as an epigenetic cue to determine the ultimate differentiation of each area. The thalamic projections, which arrive early to the cortex, are strong candidates for this extrinsic signal. We propose to investigate the various forms of interactions between the thalamic fibres and different compartments of the developing mouse cortex at well defined periods of thalamocortical development as thalamic projections accumulate within the subplate layer below the developing cortical plate and while they invade the cortex and start to recognize their ultimate target cells in layer 4. The proposed projects present unique opportunities to address fundamental questions. (1) We shall examine whether or not thalamic projections influence cortical neurogenesis. (2) We shall investigate the role of the earliest functional connections in the delivery and layerspecific targeting of thalamocortical projections. We wish to examine the contribution of the various forms of transmission (regulated, spontaneous, paracrine vesicle release) in thalamocortical and cortical development using Snap-25 and Munc-18 KO mice and in paradigms created in organotypic co-cultures. (3) Using selected mutants (Sema6A KO, L1 KO and reeler mutant mice and Shaking Rat Kawasaki) we are particularly interested in further investigating the mechanisms by which thalamic projections home into a particular cortical region and layer. The proposal would start to identify ontogenetic programs responsible for key developmental events whose disruption could lead to numerous malformations and devastating diseases such as childhood epilepsy, schizophrenia and autism. We are in a competitive position to perform the experimental work since we have already made contributions to the field, accumulated a large volume of pilot data and key collaborations are in place. I have had a long standing interest in cerebral cortical development and application of in vitro methods, including organotypic co-culture and thalamocortical slice preparations. In addition the proposals are particularly timely since some of the technologies and transgenic animals have just became available. The MRC support would enable me to consolidate my position in this exciting and growing field.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	682418.0	GBP

In colorectal cancer (CRC) only a handful of major driver genes are established. We do not known the full complement of mutations and other molecular lesions that cause CRC, and explain its diversity, because the search for CRC drivers has focused heavily on coding regions.

The availability of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data through initiatives including the 100,000 Genomes Project (100KGP) offers the opportunity to identify different classes of functional mutations for CRC and decipher their biological impact. We shall use complementary experimental approaches to achieve these aims in a work programme comprising three phases: (1) cataloguing the mutational landscape of CRC by analysis of 100KGP, in-house and publicly accessible WGS data; (2) identifying recurrently mutated driver loci (coding, non-coding and copy number) by integrating mutation data with tissue-specific gene expression, epigenetic and topographical data; and (iii) functional analyses to validate and delineate oncogenic mechanisms.

However, prostate cancer is difficult to manage clinically, due to a poor current understanding of what dictates its highly variable natural history, and of what underlies the development of castration-resistant disease. The aetiology of this disease and in particular the reasons for ethnic differences in incidence are not understood. There is an urgent requirement to execute a large-scale and highly integrated research programme that will achieve breakthrough advances in understanding the molecular and cellular basis of this disease, including the identification of new biomarkers and drug targets. Specific Aims of Research: We [International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC)-Prostate Cancer] are a group of French, Canadian, US, Asian, and UK investigators. This is an application to fund the UK, Asian, and US members of the consortium. The proposed project consists of a Pilot Study and a Full Study. The aim of the Pilot Study is to set up and test a multi-centre structure that complies with ICGC standards. The aim of the Full Study is to determine the full genome DNA sequence for 250 prostate specimens, mostly cancers. The overall scientific aims are: (i) to understand molecular basis of the clinical heterogeneity of prostate cancer; (ii) to understand the large variation in incidences that occur in different populations and ethnic groups; (iii) to understand the molecular basis of development of castration-resistant and metastatic disease; (iv) to determine whether driving genetic alterations are unique to cancer epithelium or may also occur in morphological ?normal' epithelium and stroma; and (v) to subsequently collect genome wide transcriptomics and epigenetic data to provide integrated models of cancer development. Outline Plan of Research: To achieve these aims the consortium will bring together several unique collections of frozen prostate cancers and prepare DNA and RNA according to common SOPs. Comparison of genomic DNA sequence of prostate cancers will be made (i) from low (Asian) and high risk (US, European) populations (ii) from patients with low, intermediate and high risks of cancer progression, (iii) from patients with localised disease and those having castration resistant and metastatic disease. Separate regions of single prostates will also be compared including cancer, apparently ?normal epithelium' and stroma. Existing infrastructure, including that set up by the NCRI Prostate Cancer Collaboratives, will be used to translate discoveries from this programme into new management strategies for prostate cancer.

Our unique patient cohort enables the observation of the natural clinical history of pre-invasive lesions and the longitudinal biopsy sampling of individual lesions, newly arising lesions, control airway and samples such as sputum and blood/serum. It is likely that the epigenetic and genetic programming of pre-invasive cancer-propagating cells defines their proliferation, differentiation, survival and future treatment sensitivity, but this remains unexplored. I will use our unique tissue biobank to develop clinically useful biomarkers of pre-invasive lesion progression, document the biological steps in pre-invasive disease progression to invasion, determine the key mechanisms driving progression and design and challenge chemo-prevention strategies. Goal 1: Delineate the gene networks/pathways, epigenetic profiles and microenvironmental constraints associated with progression of pre-malignant lesions to invasive cancer 1.1 Discriminate biomarker accuracy in determining progressive from regressive lesions, enabling use as a clinical tool 1.2 Define the key driver oncogenes and pathways in progressive pre-invasive lesions to inform therapeutic strategies to block malignant clone expansion 1.3 Define the influence of the pre-invasive clone microenvironment on lesion progression Goal 2: Determine the cellular origin of pre-invasive lesions and the key mechanisms of clone expansion and progression to malignancy 2.1 Use a single-cell approach to define biological and f unctional subgroups of human basal cells and relate them to those of pre-invasive lesions 2.2 Examine the effects of mis-expression of key signalling pathways or driver mutations on basal cell clonal dynamics with a view to therapeutic intervention	Wellcome Trust	Senior Research Fellowship Clinical Renewal	1908971.0	GBP

Thus, a functional placenta is essential for a successful pregnancy in humans and other mammals. To accomplish this important function, cells that will form the placenta, so-called 'trophoblast' cells, are the first to differentiate (specialise) in the first few days after fertilization. Once the fertilized egg implants into the uterus, a specialised trophoblast cell type penetrates into the surrounding uterine tissue, makes contact to maternal blood vessels and redirects the maternal blood circulation towards the embryo. These developmental processes are of fundamental importance for the progression of pregnancy. The project investigates the molecular basis of the early separation of cells that will go on to form the placenta from those that will form the embryo proper. It also investigates the precise role of factors that may be instrumental to enable trophoblast cells to invade into the adjacent uterine tissue and to promote maternal blood flow towards the embryo. This analysis will gain significant insights into the differentiation of placental cells and their vascular interactions that are of critical importance for the outcome of pregnancy.

We will use chromatin immunoprecipitation on microarrays [ChIP-Chip] to measure DNA repair factor binding throughout the yeast genome both before and after UV. We will also use this approach to measure epigenetic changes in the nucleosomes of chromatin in response to UV damage. Next generation sequencing on the ABI / Illumina platforms will be used to examine nucleosome mapping/chromatin remodeling in response to UV damage. We have direct access to the ABI SOLiD 5500 next generation sequencing system available via the Wales Gene Park and supported by a NISCHR funded BRU post in my laboratory. We have access also to the Illumina platform via our collaborator T. Owen-Hughes. We have developed new technology to examine the frequency of DNA damage at high resolution throughout entire genomes (Teng, et al 2011 A novel method for the genome-wide high resolution analysis of DNA damage. Nucleic Acids Research, January; 39(2). The method was developed employing S.cerevsiae as a model organism. Via our approach we can measure DNA damage and its repair in the entire S.cerevisiae genome. This method allows us to determine how DNA damage is repaired in the context of chromatin. We will relate the repair events to changes in chromatin that facilitate DNA repair such as covalent histone modifications and chromatin remodeling activities as described in the proposal. Biochemical studies on the in vitro activities of the GG-NER complex will involve the purification of native and recombinant proteins from yeast and bacteria. The biochemical activities of these proteins will be analysed using the in vitro experiments described in the case for support.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	346385.0	GBP

The likely physiological significance of this discovery is heightened by the presence of known virulence loci among those we identified, including that encoding biosynthesis of the immunotoxin gliotoxin, and a siderophore biosynthetic gene cluster containing genes essential for virulence. Similar experimentation in the biotrophic fungal phytopathogen, Ustilago maydis, recently identified a similar phenomenon, linking gene function to virulence for a number of loci. We hypothesise that co- regulation of genes located within the A. fumigatus 'infection clusters' indicates concerted function during initiation of mammalian infection and we now wish to determine the role of such 'infection' clusters (ICs) in A. fumigatus niche-adaptation, host damage and virulence. In order to do this we plan to expand our microarray anlayses, assessing time series gene expression profiles during initiation of infection in two murine models. We will also optimise a recombineering protocol suitable for high throughput aspergillus fumigatus gene deletion cassette construction . This will enable us to delete genes within, and surrounding, important ICs. Using this approach we will make full deletions of up to 96 ICs. IC mutants will be characterised for defects in growth, development, proteinase secretion, cytotoxicty, virulence and adhesion. We will further interrogate the transcriptional regulation of five important ICs using RT-PCR analysis. Epigenetic regulation will also be assessed using A. fumigatus mutants defective in histone deacetylase activity and methyltransferase activity.

Nevertheless, recent therapeutic and epigenetic studies have demonstrated the potential application and safety of hEG derivatives as transplantable treatment for degenerative diseases. These findings advocate strongly for the inclusion of hEG cells, alongside human embryonic stem (hES) cells, in research programs. Nevertheless, substantial hurdles remain: before the differentiation of human stem cells for therapeutic value, adequate numbers of pluripotent cells need to be derived and expanded. Pivotal to this progress is an increased understanding of the factors and signalling pathways critical to their derivation and maintenance of pluripotency. Despite characteristics shared with mouse and human ES cells, conflicting observations suggest factors intrinsic and/or extrinsic to hEG cells affect their properties, such as: efficiency of derivation, spontaneous differentiation, and the responsiveness to - and requirement for - various signalling factors. These issues require resolution. Therefore, drawing on training collaborations with renowned experts, this fellowship seeks to determine and investigate: (i) the factors that influence hEG cell derivation and; (ii) the pathways necessary for the maintenance of hEG cell pluripotency. Based at Southampton, I am continuing to derive hEG cells from PGCs, and will determine the presence of the component factors of signalling pathways in PGCs and hEG cells. This will provide the base knowledge, upon which to conduct experiments to ascertain those pathways involved in hEG cell derivation. These studies will be progressed at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, where, under the guidance of Dr. Peter Donovan, I will gain experience with the mouse modal for cross-comparison with hEG cell derivation. Subsequently, I will progress to a detailed investigation of the transcription factors active in the maintenance of hEG cell self-renewal and pluripotency, via training in Edinburgh with Austin Smith, who has dissected the functioning of such factors in ES cells. The collaborative periods proposed in this fellowship will benefit my return to Southampton, where I will be able to apply my training in first-class dedicated stem cell laboratories in a new Developmental Origins of Health & Disease building. Integrating with other group researchers, findings from these studies will carry significant comparative implications for hES cells. This application is timely, both for the progression of stem cell biology, and to promote my transition to independent researcher, as part of a cohesive Southampton Stem Cell and Embryo Group.

263	Professor Andrea Streit	King's College London	Craniofacial Dev and Stem Cell Biology	2018-02-01	2021-01-31	Epigenetic mechanisms underlying hearing impairment	Hearing loss affects many people and is often due to hair cell (HC) loss in the cochlea. HCs cannot regenerate, while surrounding supporting cells (SCs) can undergo reprogramming to form new HCs, but this ability is lost shortly after birth. Major questions are: how to promote HC regeneration from endogenous sources and how to prevent HC and SC degeneration? Increasingly associated with disease and reprogramming, epigenetic changes are likely to play a crucial role. We will study the chromatin remodellers Chd7 and -4, which when mutated in humans cause sensorineural hearing loss. CHD7 mutations are associated with CHARGE and other syndromes, while mutations in CHD4 cause CHARGE-like defects. Our data in mice indicate that without Chd7 hair cells die. This project will unravel the molecular function of Chd7 and -4 in the mouse ear to identify cell-specific targets and elucidate their mechanism by i) deleting Chd7/4 in hair and supporting cells to characterise their phenotype ii) determining the time when Chd7 function in vivo can be rescued iii) examining the transcriptome changes in Chd7/4 mutant and control HCs and SCs at specific time points Integration of these data is a powerful strategy to identify direct targets unique and in common to Chd4 and Chd7 and thus link hearing loss due to Chd7/4 mutations with downstream molecular events. These data provide a rich resource to use bioinformatics and modelling to unravel the gene networks downstream of Chd7 and -4 as the basis to discover new causative deafness genes and pathways. This research will not only elucidate the mechanism of sensorineural hearing loss in CHARGE and other syndromes, but also form the basis for restorative strategies. It will provide a road into understanding the epigenetic landscape of the normal and degenerating ear and thus have wide implications to develop regenerative or protective strategies to restore hearing.

267	Dr Gavin Kelsey	Babraham Institute	Epigenetics	2018-08-01	2023-07-31	Epigenome patterning in oocytes and its legacies in the embryo	Transmission of epigenetic information from parent to offspring is generally precluded by multiple genome-wide reprogramming steps that occur from the specification of germ cells, during gametogenesis, in the preimplantation embryo, and with establishment of lineage-specific epigenomes from implantation. Yet the extent to which there is inter-generational transmission of epigenetic states is still unclear and of substantial interest, eg, in relation to factors such as the increase in maternal obesity and the programming of adverse metabolic outcomes in offspring, or whether epigenetic fidelity is compromised by procedures for assisted reproduction. Genomic imprinting provides the best paradigm for epigenetic inheritance, and which is fundamentally important for normal offspring growth, development and long-term health. Until recently, it appeared that there was a single modality of imprinting, determined by gamete-derived DNA methylation, but recent studies prompt us to develop a more nuanced view and to recognise additional pathways to imprinting, such as chromatin-determined imprinting. This programme will explore transcriptional control and how transcription patterns the epigenome in the oocyte and the legacies of these events in the embryo. It will investigate how DNA methylation-dependent and chromatin-dependent modes or imprinting are set up at different times in the female germline and how they contribute in different ways to developmental processes in the embryo and extra-embryonic lineages. It will assess general principles at the genome-wide scale, but also work at the level of specific loci to test mechanistic details and functional impacts of the different modes of imprinting. It will explore variation in DNA methylation in human preimplantation embryos, how this variation can be traced back to methylation variation in oocytes and seek to eludiate the genetic basis and pathophysiological correlates of such variation.

268	Prof Lillycrop	University of Southampton	None	2016-11-01	2019-10-31	Gestational Diabetes, the epigenome and the health of the next generation	The incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing concurrent with the rising prevalence of maternal obesity. Children born to mothers with GDM have an increased risk of obesity and metabolic disease in adulthood, leading to a worsening intergenerational cycle of metabolic disease. Better understanding of the mechanisms through which GDM exposure translates into the development of obesity in children is urgently needed to break this cycle of metabolic disease. To date there have been few intervention studies in this area, which has led to a poor understanding of the mechanisms and thus ineffective targeting of the causal pathways. However, there is now growing evidence that maternal GDM induces stable modifications of the offspring epigenome, resulting in persistent changes in gene expression and a lifelong increased risk of obesity. Utilising the biobank of the largest RCT of a lifestyle intervention (low glycemic index diet and increased physical activity) in obese pregnant women (UK Pregnancy Better Eating and Activity Trial, UPBEAT), this application will for the first time directly assess the role of epigenetic processes in mediating the effect of maternal GDM on adiposity in the offspring and identify maternal lifestyle behaviors and treatment modalities that modify this risk.

269	Dr Gavin Kelsey	Babraham Institute	Developmental Genetics and Imprinting	2008-11-24	2013-04-23	Role of germline transcription events in DNA methylation acquisition at imprinted genes	Genomic imprinting refers to the differential epigenetic marking of genes in the male and female gametes, which results in the silencing of one of the parental alleles in somatic tissues. Imprinted genes perform essential roles in the placenta and fetus to control nutrient provision and growth, and after birth to coordinate physiological adaptations to feeding, independent metabolic control, and also mental function. In addition to the characterised imprinted syndromes, disruption of imprinting occurs widely in cancers, has been described in association with assisted reproductive technologies (ART), and imprinted genes are regarded as important potential targets in the developmental programming of chronic adult disease. A fundamental but poorly understood mechanism in imprinting is the marking by CpG methylation of imprinting control regions (ICRs) in germ cells, particularly in the female germline, which is where the majority of imprinting is established. Although the protein factors responsible are known to be the de novo DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a and its cofactor Dnmt3L, the key issue of how these factors select ICRs as targets for methylation is unclear. Recent work suggests involvement of the methylation state of lysine 4 on histone H3 and the patterning of CpG dinucleotides. Working in the mouse Gnas locus, we now have compelling evidence that a transcriptional event is also essential for establishment of germline methylation marks. In this application, we shall investigate the mechanistic links between transcription and methylation establishment in oocytes. We shall examine their temporal relationship, including the development of a new knock-out in the Gnas locus in which we can delete the essential transcript at various times in germ cell development. We shall look at the histone properties of the sequences to be methylated and their dependence on transcriptional events. We shall investigate the generality of our proposed mechanism for imprinted loci, including the generation of a loss-of-imprinting allele, based on our model, of the Zac1 gene, which is implicated in the imprinted disorder 6q24 transient neonatal diabetes. Insights gained from this work will be directly relevant to the causes of imprinted gene disorders and global errors in imprinting, and potentially to imprinting defects which may be associated with ART and other aberrant methylation events, such as tumour suppressor genes.

The work will be conducted mostly in the mouse as the model of choice for understanding epigenetic processes in gametes and preimplantation embryos. The connections we shall explore between transcription and methylation are based on known properties of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3L - which constitute the de novo methylation complex active in oocytes and which is believed to sense histone modifications - and histone modifying factors with evidence for transcription-coupled activity. Of particular interest to us is methylation of H3K4 and H3K36, which can be modified in response to transcription. We shall use conditional knock-outs for factors of the Kdm1 and Kdm5 families, which regulate H3K4 methylation, and we shall mutate Dnmt3a so that it is no longer binds the transcription-coupled mark H3K36me3. We shall map transcription units and promoter activity and how they change during oocyte growth, and correlate this with timing of DNA methylation in specific genes. We shall ablate specific transcription factors expressed in oocytes, and investigate whether this leads to predicted changes in gene body and intragenic CpG island methylation. This will be done with conditional alleles for transcription factors with known roles in oogenesis, but we shall also identify additional transcription factors with effects during the de novo methylation phase of oocyte growth by informatics analysis of expression and transcription start site datasets. We shall use our highly sensitive DNA methylation profiling (RRBS) as an endpoint in many of these mechanistic studies. We shall use RRBS (and other techniques we might develop) to profile changes in methylation in oocytes and embryos in response to manipulations in maternal diet and superovulation. We shall also profile DNA methylation in human preimplantation embryos to identify conserved sites and properties of DNA methylation.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	1818076.0	GBP

While our understanding of the condition is progressing, adequate therapies are still lacking and millions of people are living with persistent, debilitating pain that has no discernable function. One of the most promising developments in recent years has been the recognition that microglial activation is a key driver of neuropathic pain. This unexpected role of neuroinflammation brings us tantalizingly close to potential new drug treatments. However, in order to translate this potential, we need answers to several key questions. First and foremost, which cells are driving chronic pain? The contribution of infiltrating monocytes versus resident microglial cells is unknown. Resolving this issue is a critical first step to target the neuroinflammatory process. A second key question is how exactly do resident microglia and infiltrating monocytes respond in different pain states? How do they mediate pro-inflammatory (and possibly antiinflammatory) cascades? And over what time courses? Are they able to maintain an epigenetic, molecular memory of previous insults, which might then 'prime' them to drive a chronic pain state? The aim of our proposal is to seek answers to these questions. A vital and obligatory step, if we hope to develop novel analgesic strategies directed at spinal neuroinflammatory processes. We are bringing together three laboratories, each with highly-specialised expertise that will enable a unique synergy. In the McMahon laboratory, we will use novel cell sorting techniques as well as highthroughput molecular analyses to define and characterise the different immune cell populations involved. Together with the Svensson laboratory, we will use a clinically relevant animal model to examine the epigenetic profile of resident microglia. And finally, the Svensson and Baron laboratories will use in-depth patient phenotyping and human tissue samples to generate translationally relevant findings. Our work will not only yield a much deeper understanding of the CNS neuroimmune response in chronic pain, but also has the potential to reveal novel upstream mediators and biomarkers that may help identify who will be at risk of developing a chronic pain condition. Crucially, it may therefore bring us one step closer to the elusive goal of adequately treating patients and thus greatly increasing their quality of life.

273	Prof Tom Fleming	University of Southampton	None	None	2018-10-31	How do preimplantation embryos sense and respond to maternal nutrition affecting fetal development and adult health?	The proposal investigates mechanisms of developmental plasticity induced within the mouse preimplantation embryo, responding to maternal dietary protein level in vivo. From our past work using this model, we have found maternal low protein diet fed exclusively during this period (Emb-LPD) leads to enhanced perinatal growth and onset of adult disease in offspring, including overweight, hypertension and abnormal behaviour especially in females. Our data show that the rise in perinatal growth is (i) induced by the blastocyst stage as a compensatory response to poor maternal diet, (ii) is mediated at least in part by increased histiotrophic endocytic activity of the extra-embryonic visceral yolk sac later in development, and (iii) is predictive of adult overweight and hypertension. Embryo responses to maternal diet may protect fetal growth and likely confer competitive fitness but also lead to adult diseases. Here, we propose three new research directions to identify the contributory mechanisms to embryo developmental plasticity: (a) to determine how dietary signals mediate embryonic growth control via the mTOR signalling complex; (b) to determine the relative contributions of placental and yolk sac lineages in the compensatory responses made by embryos to maternal diet, and (c) to determine whether these physiological mechanisms derive from epigenetic changes to key gene families; notably, (i) DNA methyltransferases which we find are significantly upregulated in transcription by dietary-induced embryo responses from the blastocyst stage onwards, and (ii) imprinted genes which, through mechanisms of genomic conflict, may coordinate extra-embryonic responses to maternal Emb-LPD. Throughout, our research plan comprises multidisciplinary approaches to understand the integrated nature of mechanisms regulating embryo developmental plasticity in vivo, reflecting the specific expertise of the individual applicants	Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council	Standard grant	814870.0	GBP

We showed that inhibition of DNA replication had unexpectedly large system- wide effects on the chromatin proteome. The aim of the current project is to use this technology to understand at a systems level how mitotic chromosome structure is established and how it is influenced by, and how it influences, the way that DNA replication occurs. We will perform timelapse proteomics of chromatin passing from G2 into mitosis and back into G1. We will use recently-developed methods to gain functional insight into proteins loaded and unloaded on chromatin at specific stages. We will select a few proteins from this proteomic analysis that have not previously been implicated in mitotic chromosome biology and study their function in detail. A range of assays will be used, including RNAi knockdown in tissue-culture cells and biochemical studies in Xenopus egg extracts. We will block DNA replication in a variety of ways and force unreplicated DNA to pass into mitosis. We will then determine how this effects the chromatin proteome and the way DNA is replicated in the following cell cycle. We will inhibit various activities related to the Anaphase Promoting Complex and determine how this changes chromatin proteins on mitotic exit. We will investigate how this affects the licensing of replication origins and subsequent DNA replication. These experiments will give us a comprehensive systems-level view of the dynamic chromosome proteome during passage through mitosis and the way the interphase and mitotic chromatin organisation is coordinated. This will help explain how epigenetic information about DNA organisation during interphase is interpreted and maintained during mitosis.

We seek funds to acquire a 3rd wave of brain MRI and a 2nd wave of carotid Doppler ultrasound data from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936, a large group of relatively healthy subjects in their late seventies. This cohort has a wide range of phenotypic data available from older age (at 70, 73, 76; 79 to be done) including cognitive, genetic, epigenetic, lifestyle, etc. Uniquely, they also have a measure of childhood intelligence from age 11. These subjects have already undergone brain MRI at ages 73 and 76, and vascular imaging at age 73. Repeat brain MRI and ultrasound scanning at age 79 will provide multi-time-point longitudinal imaging data across the eighth decade of life. This will be used to investigate associations between older age brain structure, vascular, genetic and other risk factors, and cognitive ability across the life course. This 3rd wave of brain MRI will be undertaken on the same GE 1.5T clinical scanner as used in the first two examinations. The imaging protocol will consist of structural, diffusion tensor (DT), magnetization transfer (MT) and quantitative T1-mapping sequences. The structural scans will be analyzed to provide measures of brain atrophy, cortical thickness and white matter hyperintensity volume. The DT, MT and T1 data will be used to segment a range of major white matter tracts and provide measures of the integrity of these structures. These imaging data will be analyzed using methods such as structural equation and longitudinal latent growth curve modelling to examine associations, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, with cognitive, genetic, epigenetic, lifestyle, and other phenotypic data to provide insights into the factors driving non-pathological cognitive ageing. The carotid Doppler ultrasound data will be used as outcome and predictor variables.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	1052368.0	GBP

Leveraging the extensive information collected within the largest European population-based cohort studies with neuroimaging data, we will first search for genetic variants associated with established and novel MRI-markers of brain aging, focusing particularly on rare variants, using both an agnostic and candidate locus approach (loci identified through genome-wide association studies [GWAS] as associated AD or with MRI-markers of brain aging). In contrast with GWAS signals, rare variants may lead to the discovery of causal variants, and have hardly been explored in association with structural MRI-markers. Second, we will take an original lifetime perspective, through examination of samples in various age categories spanning from young adulthood to older age, many of which with repeated MRI and blood sampling. Indeed, there is increasing evidence that early-life factors play an important role in the occurrence of late-onset neurodegenerative diseases. We propose an innovative exploration of lifetime changes in methylation associated with structural brain alterations using a novel bisulfite sequencing technology, to help identify functional and disease relevant variants. We will also study the modifying effect of vascular risk factors and socio-economic status on genetic/epigenetic determinants of brain aging. Third, we will explore the clinical significance of genetic and epigenetic markers we identify by examining their association with cognitive performance, cognitive decline and risk of dementia/AD, capitalizing on the elaborate cognitive testing and prospective dementia surveillance available in all studies.

However, since the reaction involves the breakage and rejoining of DNA, it is inherently risky and between 35-40% of lymphoid cancers appear to have arisen from mistakes in V(D)J and class switch recombination reactions. Since lymphoid cancers are the fourth most common cancer type, with 10,000 new cases per year in the UK alone, there is a strong need to better understand what triggers these aberrant recombination reactions. The experiments to investigate aberrant recombination reactions rely heavily on the use of mice and, until recently, have been hampered by the scarcity of cells undergoing recombination. V(D)J recombination occurs only in a fleeting population of cells during B and T cell development and, once it has occurred, the cells differentiate. Thus, few cells can be purified and it is very hard to isolate cells exactly at the point that they are undergoing V(D)J recombination. We have now developed a novel inducible V(D)J recombination system in which recombination can be activated at will. This is an extremely powerful new tool that has opened up many new avenues of research to examine how mistakes in V(D)J recombination trigger cancer. Currently this inducible V(D)J recombination system relies on isolating primary pro-B cells from transgenic mice. Thus, although many new projects are now possible, it is estimated that these projects would use 40,000‒50,000 mice over the next five years. Here, we propose to completely replace the use of these mice by generating a cell line from the pro-B cells. This cell line will be compared with primary cells to test if it undergoes recombination with the same magnitude and timing as the primary cells and if it retains all other epigenetic changes associated with recombination. If it does, then it will be an extremely powerful tool to address a plethora of questions about how aberrant recombination reactions are triggered. The final part of this studentship will examine one of these questions, namely to better understand the safeguards that prevent chromosome translocations during V(D)J recombination. These are a major cause of cancer and, to prevent translocations occurring, it is vital that the DNA regions undergoing recombination are activated coordinately and that these regions are brought together before double strand breaks are introduced. So far, nothing is known about the temporal regulation of these processes but the inducible V(D)J recombination system makes these experiments possible for the first time. Thus, this work could provide significant insights into the safeguards that suppress leukaemogenic translocations. Together, these studies aim to generate an extremely powerful new tool that is likely to be of great utility not only to our lab but also to other labs throughout the world with related interests in V(D)J recombination. This cell line will enable numerous new projects to determine how aberrant recombination reactions lead to lymphoid cancers and will result in the complete replacement of substantial numbers of mice.

The ultimate aim is to translate this knowledge to improve survival rates in patients. Recent studies from our laboratory and other laboratories have shown that, within any one patient’s tumour, there is functional, molecular and genetic heterogeneity of tumour propagating populations. Though not yet formally demonstrated, layered upon this will likely be epigenetic heterogeneity. Thus, our key questions centre around understanding: a) the nature of this heterogeneity; b) how it arises and c) how different aspects of heterogeneity impact on each other. From a tumour biology perspective, a central hypothesis we will work towards testing is that there are specific molecular attributes present in AML LPC, but absent in downstream progeny, that explain LPC’s ability to propagate tumours whereas downstream progeny cannot. Experimentally, these studies will initially be cell population based. We will purify distinct immunophenotypic primary human AML populations, test their in vivo function, and determine their molecular, genetic and epigenetic profiles. This will be an iterative process. But, ultimately, these studies will have to be conducted at the single cell level,. To begin with, we will overlay single cell molecular and genetic analysis on the cell population-based studies. From a translational standpoint, our key hypotheses are: A) AML LPC are the chemoresistant relapse-driving populations. B) LPC can be therapeutically targeted. Only if both hypotheses are proven correct will be able to improve survival for patients. To test the first hypothesis, we will track LPC from diagnosis through therapy. To address the second hypothesis, we will continue work with Stanford to develop a combination of therapeutic antibodies targeting LPC antigens. Once again, there are huge challenges here, that include: a) defining a window between efficacy and toxicity given that many LPC markers are widely expressed b) defining cocktails of antibodies that target all chemoresistant LPCs.

Our overarching hypothesis is that chronic and cumulative infection exposure influences immunological mechanisms through active processes (during current infection), lasting epigenetic modifications, and genetic selection; that (therefore) some effects do not immediately respond to treatment; and that effects critically impact upon major health outcomes including vaccine responses and susceptibility to pathogens, allergy-related disease and metabolic conditions (Figure 8.8). The main focus of our work is on vaccine responses, addressing the role of infectious exposures in striking population differences in vaccine immunogenicity. We also support studies on the role of chronic infection in allergy-related and metabolic disease susceptibility. Building on recent findings, exploiting unique platforms that we have established, we aim to determine the effects of infectious exposures (prenatal, cumulative life-time and current, active exposures) on health outcomes comprising: 1. Vaccine immunogenicity 2. Infectious disease susceptibility – focussing on oncogenic viruses 3. Asthma phenotypes and allergy-related effector mechanisms 4. Infection, inflammation and cardio-metabolic risk To obtain deeper insights into mechanisms by which infections have their effects, we plan complementary studies (for which funding is available, or being sought elsewhere) on the mediating role of the microbiome and on the mediating role of epigenetic modifications In addition, the programme supports related studies on tuberculosis and schistosomiasis, and genetic studies.

Malaria imposes ruinous impact on human health in the tropics and the global economy. Basic research on Plasmodium spp. causing malaria should uncover features of parasite biology and interactions with host and/or vector ultimately of therapeutic potential. Transmission of Plasmodium requires female Anopheline mosquitoes, is a bottleneck, essential and a target for intervention. Transmission is initiated by specialised sexually dimorphic forms (gametocytes) that form gametes that mate in the mos quito midgut. Formation of gametocytes (gametocytogenesis) is seemingly initiated stochastically in the bloodstream of the infected host and shown by my group to depend solely upon the expression of a conserved, master regulator transcription factor AP2-G. How AP2-G is regulated and what AP2-G regulates are the chief concerns of this proposal. The outcome will be a mechanistic understanding of: 1. Commitment to gametocytogenesis (CtG). 2. Subsequent gametocyte development. We will dissect the epigenetic links controlling CtG to the variant transcription of genes (VToG) which influences diverse bloodstage virulence-associated processes such as antigenic variation. The varied roles of the environment, signalling, epigenetic regulation, nuclear architecture, RNA stability and inherent stochastic variation impacting both CtG and VToG will be clarified. We will operate largely at the single cell level using and further developing the many cutting edge molecular tools and unique parasite lines generated by my laboratory. Data will be set in an evolutionary framework seeking to understand how isogenic parasites develop diversity including CtG. We will focus on rodent malaria parasites to model these phenomena translating critical observations to human infectious Plasmodium.	Wellcome Trust	Principal Research Fellowship Renewal	3547501.0	GBP

We hypothesise that a significant proportion of single nucleotide variants (SNPs) uncovered by genome-wide association studies of blood pressure and hypertension (BP GWAS) operate through effects on kidney DNA methylation. We will characterise the landscape of DNA methylation in ≈500 human kidneys and integrate this information with matching sets of renal transcriptomes and regulatory chromatin annotations. Through two-sample Mendelian randomisation of kidney methylome and BP GWAS from ≈500,000 UK Biobank individuals we will examine the causal effect of kidney DNA methylation on hypertension. We will further use CRISPR/Cas9 system to explore the biological significance of the uncovered kidney methylation targets and provide mechanistic insights into their regulatory role. Our studies will uncover epigenetic footprints of hypertension driving translation of BP GWAS findings into the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic targets.

Genomic analyses of complex human diseases demonstrate both the importance of epigenetic processes and our limited mechanistic understanding. We therefore propose to focus on understanding key epigenetic mechanisms, bringing together the major themes of nuclear organisation, genome packaging and transmission, chromatin states and RNA biology. We will chart key interconnections between these processes, identifying mechanisms and regulation. WTCCB will combine genetics, biochemistry, genomics, mathematical modelling, imaging, synthetic biology and single cell analyses to address key questions: 1) Do epigenetic mechanisms drive or reflect changes in gene expression, in response to the environment, development and disease? 2) What are the functions of lncRNAs and other RNAs in regulating gene expression? 3) How is the genetic information faithfully transmitted during mitosis and meiosis? 4) How are changes in the structure of chromatin and other complexes linked to specific human diseases? To enhance the medical impact of our research, WTCCB will forge strategic alliances with experts in medical genetics. We will generate insights into mechanisms underlying human pathologies, potentially opening routes to longer-term therapeutic solutions.	Wellcome Trust	Wellcome Trust Centre	6207791.0	GBP
289	Professor Julie Ahringer	University of Cambridge	None	2013-12-01	2019-12-31	The regulation of chromatin structure and function.	We will use the power of functional genetics and genomics in C. elegans to address fundamental questions in chromatin regulation and transcriptional control, by analysing epigenetic state and function in wild-type and mutant animals and tissues. Chromatin is the organization of genomic DNA with histones that can have a wide range of post-translational modifications and hundreds of associated proteins and RNAs. The composition and structure of chromatin determines activity state and is central to the control of transcription, the expression of cell identity, the maintenance of pluripotency, and the transformation to cancer. However, our knowledge of chromatin composition and understanding of chromatin regulator function is still at a basic level. C. elegans has a complement of core chromatin factors very similar to that of humans (many with existing mutants), a small well-annotated genome (30x smaller than human), RNAi for loss of function studies, and well-characterised cell fates. We will combine the strengths of model organism genetics with genome-wide chromatin phenotyping to unravel mechanisms of chromatin regulation that will have impact across animals. Our specific aims: 1. More comprehensively characterize properties of wild-type chromatin and discover regulatory principles that operate in cell fate determination and differentiation. 2. Use global chromatin phenotype profiling of mutants to unravel functions and mechanisms of action of conserved chromatin regulators important for human biology. 3. Profile transcription initiation and elongation to investigate the developmental regulation of promoters, enhancers, and non-coding transcription, and use transgene constructs for their functional analyses.

290	Professor Alastair Sutcliffe	University College London	None	2011-05-01	2013-04-30	Are children born after assisted reproduction at increased risk of cancer? A population based linkage study	BACKGROUND: The number of children born after Assisted Reproduction Technologies (ART) is rising year on year (0.5% of UK births in 1992, rising to 1.8% in 2007). There are over 1 million such children under 14 years of age in Europe and over 3.5 million worldwide. It is not known if these growing numbers of children are at higher risk of cancer. However there are reasons why a higher risk of childhood cancer may exist in this group. These include epigenetic aberrations which have recently been found in human ART embryos, cord blood and placenta. An internationally unique opportunity has arisen to investigate this rare outcome. A change in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) Act effective from April 2010 will allow records from the registry database (recording all births after ART since 1992) to be used for research purposes (with due caveats). AIMS: To establish: a) If there is a higher risk of cancer in children (aged 0-14 years inclusive) born after assisted reproduction than in the general population of British children. b) If different ART methods give rise to differing childhood cancer risk METHODS: This study will link 149,000 children recorded on the HFEA registry to the National Childhood Cancer Registry (which is the largest childhood cancer registry worldwide and records all childhood cancers occurring in the UK). The linkage will be carried out within the HFEA. The number of cases in the cohort will be compared with the number expected, based on annual age-specific UK incidence rates for childhood cancer 1992-2008. This study already has ethical approval/peer review (including from the NIGB). RESULTS: The results of this research will be used to inform ART stakeholders of this key ART outcome. Stakeholders include couples wishing to undergo ART, families who have used ART, the general public & fertility treatment teams. Should a higher risk of any site specific cancer be found, this will need further investigation to determine if this is related to any component of ART treatment (with a view to modifying practice). A lower risk or nil effect will be a useful population health message relevant to this growing proportion of the nation's children and their families, some of whom have requested this study.

Although GWAS has identified 40 T2D genes, mostly expressed in pancreatic beta-cells, this explains no more than 10% of T2D inheritance. Up to 5% of T2D patients have dominantly inherited maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), characterized by beta-cell dysfunction. Elucidating the genetics of familial early-onset T2D, using Whole-Exome Sequencing (WES) can bring breakthroughs in understanding insulin secretion physiology. DNA methylation, particularly in insulin sensitive tissues may also contribute to T2D. Newly-developed genome-wide methylation arrays can be used to identify associations with these epigenetic elements and T2D. In the proposed project, GEPIDIAB, I will take advantage of our MODY family DNA collection and multi-tissue biobank to 1: identify novel genetic causes of familial T2D (WP1) and 2: identify DNA methylation variation associated with T2D (WP2). In WP1, unresolved MODY-X families will be studied using WES to identify novel sequence changes. Then we will elucidate the cellular and metabolic mechanisms leading to beta-cell dysfunction caused by these novel mutations. In WP2, variation in DNA methylation at 450K sites across the genome will be studied in normoglycemic or diabetic bariatric surgery patients. Five separate tissue samples will be studied to identify tissue-specific variation, individual-specific variation and that which varies between cases and controls. We will explore whether there are T2D-specific patterns of methylation that are distinct from those in lean or obese normoglycemic subjects using bisulfite-whole genome sequencing. Overall, we will identify genome-wide methylation patterns that are cell and tissue-specific and disease-specific for five main tissues important in T2D. Together, genetics and epigenetics will complement each other to give a deeper understanding of both insulin deficiency and resistance.	European Research Council	Advanced Grant	2476325.0	EUR

The laboratory will explore how mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), Protein Kinase B (PKB), Protein Kinase D2 (PKD2) and the AMP-activated Protein Kinase alpha1 (AMPKalpha1) integrate antigen receptor, cytokine and nutrient signalling to control T cell metabolism, cytokine production and T cell migration/trafficking. One focus will be the transcription factors Foxo1 and KLF2 because these molecules integrate signalling by mTOR, PKB and AMPK to control T cell fate. One core technology will be high resolution mass spectrometry to map the proteome and phosphoproteome of T lymphocyte subpopulations and to define Foxo1 and KLF2 protein complexes. Phosphoproteomic analysis of CD8 cytotoxic T cells has revealed links between serine/threonine kinases and chromatin regulators. The future program will test the concepts generated by this work but additionally define the phosphoproteome of na ve T cells and CD4 T cell subpopulations. The functional relevance of the biochemical data will be inte rrogated rigorously using bioinformatics, mouse molecular genetics and analysis of T cell function in vivo. The experiments to comprehensively map T cell phosphoproteomes will be a valuable community resource and reveal the signalling pathways that maintain the essential epigenetic and transcriptional programs that define how peripheral T cells control metabolism and function.

293	Professor Robert Newbold	Brunel University	None	2009-01-12	2012-03-01	Development and validation of mechanisms-based in vitro transformation assays for carcinogen screening	Humans are exposed to many man-made and naturally occurring chemicals at levels never before encountered during our evolution. A significant number of these can be expected to possess some degree of carcinogenic activity, either because they are able to interact with our DNA causing gene mutations or chromosome aberrations, or through some non-mutational mechanism (for example, epigenetic changes in gene expression, forced cell proliferation). It is therefore of vital importance for human health that we have in place reliable comprehensive screening procedures to establish which chemicals have carcinogenic potential, and to regulate human exposure to them. Currently approved systems are centred on laboratory animal tumour-induction tests, usually involving live rats or mice. These test are often complemented, or preceded by, short-term in vitro assays in bacteria or mammalian cells in culture that measure the ability of a chemical to induce genetic change. There is now enormous public support for reducing the numbers of live animals used in research, particularly in the area of toxicology. Advances in our understanding of the cell and molecular biology of cancer have over the past 25 years meant that we are now able to study individual steps in the cancer process using human or rodent cells grown in tissue culture. These cell-transformation models now offer enormous, largely untapped, potential for carcinogenicity screening. In this project, we aim to develop such cell transformation systems, based on hamster and human cells in culture, and to provide sufficient mechanistic underpinning confirming that the transformation endpoints (for example, cell immortalization, focus formation) measured, involve events that are directly relevant to the molecular mechanisms driving human carcinogenesis. In preliminary work we have used telomerase hTERT expression vectors to immortalise normal human breast epithelial cells, generating minimally transformed human cell systems responsive to the induction of later transformation events by carcinogens. We have also started to produce a complete molecular genetic description of existing assays based on Syrian hamster cells, particularly with respect to identifying the role of carcinogen-induced p16 damage in the all-important immortalisation step in transformation. We now propose to complete the cellular and molecular characterisation of transformation phenotypes in both systems and, further, to refine our assays and validate them using panels of human and rodent carcinogens representing a range of known mechanisms of action. By these means, a new generation of in vitro tests will be produced that can be incorporated into existing carcinogenicity screening regimes.

Proteins that regulate modification pathways are often found mutated in cancer, so substantial effort within pharmaceutical companies is aimed at small molecule inhibitors of epigenetic targets. Our efforts are primarily concentrated on identifying novel modifications and characterizing their function with respect to transcription (or other processes if necessary). We have found in the past that this approach identifies new targets for drug discovery, which is part of the purpose for their identification. We are also involved in characterizing the mechanism of action of new small molecule inhibitors, provided to us by pharmaceutical companies. This involves understanding the basic biological pathways disrupted by the chemical compound. The results from this work can lead to the identification of new chromatin targets, against which drug discovery may be directed. It can also result in the generation of valuable mechanistic information around a compound, which allows for its entry into clinical trials.

The current programme centres on the RUNX/CBF genes, which can promote or suppress cancer development and are frequently mutated by chromosomal translocations in human leukaemia. The three mammalian Runx genes play essential roles in the development of blood, bone and neuronal cells and are implicated in tumour suppression as shown by loss of function mutations in some human leukaemias and epigenetic silencing in cancers of epithelial tissues (see Nature Reviews on Cancer 2005, 5: 376-87). We have found that the Runx genes can also act as oncogenes when activated by retroviral mutagenesis or expressed ectopically. This dualistic role is due in part to the ability of Runx to drive cell death, senescence-like growth arrest or survival according to context. The mechanisms and pathways by which the Runx genes control these fundamental processes are currently being explored with the aim of identifying novel targets for therapeutic intervention. We are also investigating the possibility of adapting established mutagenesis screening methods to probe the human cancer cell genome in vivo.

The role of epigenetic remodelling.	The aim of this project is to perform a preliminary evaluation of whether feeding a hypercaloric cafeteria diet to rats during lactation and/or from weaning impacts upon epigenetic regulation (DNA methylation) of hepatic glucose uptake, insulin signalling and lipid metabolism. The study will use livers collected from a previously published study which established that maternal cafeteria feeding prior to pregnancy, during pregnancy or during lactation could programme glucose tolerance, with the effect being dependent upon the nature of the weaning diet. Nursing rat dams were fed either control diet or a cafeteria diet during the lactation period. Half of the offspring were weaned onto control and half onto cafeteria diet. 3 month-old offspring were subjected to a glucose tolerance test prior to cull. We will measure expression of PPAR?, PPAR?, the insulin receptor and GLUT4 at the mRNA and protein level. Using an ELISA for methylated DNA we will assess global DNA methylation changes in the samples. Bisulfite conversion and methylation specific PCR will be used to assess changes in methylation of the four specific gene targets. The project will consider tissue specificity and sex-specificity of effects of diet upon gene expression and DNA methylation.	Diabetes UK	Small Grant	7444.0	GBP

Radiotherapy toxicity is dose-limiting and impairs quality-of-life in long-term survivors. Modern radiotherapy techniques improve outcomes but future gains require biological optimisation - information on radiosensitivity being particularly useful. Radiosensitivity is a complex, polygenic, heritable trait. Rare mutations (e.g. in ATM) have large effects but most of the variation in radiosensitivity is attributed to common genetic variants (mostly single nucleotide polymorphisms - SNPs) each conferring small, but together clinically exploitable, effects. SNPs are identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Our GWAS in RAPPER prostate and breast patients (n~1,800) showed the strongest SNP associations were with prostate cancer toxicity endpoints rather than an overall toxicity measure. Meta-analysis of four prostate GWAS (n~1,600) revealed many SNP associations, some reaching genome-wide-appropriate statistical significance. More will be significant in larger studies and we can calculate the study size needed to identify them. Aims: RAPPER-3 aims to continue the collection of bloods from radiotherapy patients to provide a resource to underpin translational research where germline DNA data can be linked with radiotherapy toxicity. The resource could also be used in studies linking genotype with cancer predisposition, tumour characteristics and survival. Other types of genetic variation including epigenetic could be studied. Methods: The focus is on prostate cancer but other cancers are included to establish cohorts for future research. The established sample collection (n~5,200) will be increased to 10,000 with ~100 samples collected a month for 4 years. RAPPER-associated trials collect information on toxicity (including pre-treatment), radiation doses and volumes, treatment (use of surgery, hormones, chemotherapy). Additional information is collected at blood collection (ethnicity, age, height, weight, co-morbidity, smoking). New trials will be supported as required. Prospective DNA extraction will ensure the resource is easily available for use in new proposals. In future research, a 10,000 cohort has high power to detect 10 SNPs for clinically-useful risk discrimination. Use for research: (1) develop a SNP profile for radiotherapy individualisation to improve cancer control and reduce toxicity; (2) increase understanding of toxicity pathogenesis to underpin future research identifying potential targets for prevention/mitigation of risk; (3) contribute to collaborative GWAS on multiple cancers/traits including (in the future) risk of second cancers; (4) identify other types of genetic variants using next generation sequencing and/or epigenetics.

Human fat distribution is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease independent of adiposity. It is often seen as intrinsic to the individual where the heritable component is made up of genetic and possibly to a larger extent epigenetic regulation. We will start by testing the causality between fat distribution and cardiovascular disease using novel Mendelian Randomization techniques. We will re-assess the heritability of fat distribution using precise definitions of regional fatness in large twin cohorts. Subsequently, we will use large cohorts with precisely characterized fat distribution to identify new genetic and epigenetic regulators of fat distribution. Novel variants will be functionally characterized in vitro and in vivo using specific adipocyte systems and human whole body investigation in participants with defined genetic/epigenetic make up. This information will be used to enable new therapies to reduce the cardiovascular disease burden.	British Heart Foundation	Programme Grant	779060.0	GBP

Decreased pancreatic beta-cell function and reduced insulin sensitivity, together with increasing obesity and inactivity are key contributors to vascular-related diabetic complications. Early diagnosis of T2DM is difficult and complications progress even after glycaemic restoration. We have discovered that human vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) cultured from T2DM subjects (age range 50-85 years) display persistent phenotypic and functional impairment, with evidence that these are driven by elevated levels of the microRNA, miR-145. We propose that metabolic disturbances in the pre-diabetes period confer long-lasting “metabolic memory” on SMC. The purpose of this project is to explore the epigenetic basis of this cell phenotype by studying histone and DNA modifications in the miR-145 locus. Secondly we will identify the stimuli that upregulate miR-145 in human SMC, and elucidate critical underlying signalling pathways using pharmacological and molecular approaches.

In the Southampton Women’s Survey (SWS) prospective preconception cohort, we have discovered perinatal epigenetic biomarkers of later CVD risk in mechanistically relevant genes, now confirmed in our other cohorts. We will determine how these biomarkers relate to the trajectory of adiposity, cardiovascular structure, function and fitness in SWS children to age 12yrs. Using SWS samples collected at birth and age 12yrs we will extend our panel of epigenetic biomarkers and investigate interactions with fixed genetic variants in relation to CVD risk.

We need to detect the disease at an early stage, but the diagnosis needs to be more accurate too. We have designed the Prostate cAncer IDentification (ProstAID) programme to test and establish means to distinguish between lethal PC that need treating, and non-lethal cancers that don’t. Lethal PC is one that begins in the prostate then spreads to other organs, eventually causing death. The time to death after initial detection of metastasis is highly variable, ranging from 1-15 years. The reasons for this are not understood. Non-lethal PC does not spread during the lifetime of the patient. Both lethal and non-lethal forms are highly prevalent. To answer to CRUK Grand Challenge 4, and put these answers to practical use, the project will identify signatures indicating “lethal” and “non-lethal” status using combined analytical data from five study cohorts with unique power: • Two large population-based cohorts (ProtecT and FinRSPC) with up to 17 years follow-up will allow association of clinical and molecular observations in treated and untreated men with and without lethal outcomes. • A new Early Metastatic Window (EMW) cohort will allow tracing the precise molecular origins of early spread, prior to androgen deprivation. • A Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) cohort will define essential characteristics of lethal PC. • A new prospective population-based screen-detected cohort wherein hypotheses developed by study of the first 4 cohorts will be tested. We will make use of the latest technologies to obtain the first complete picture of clinical, genetic, epigenetic, immunological, and imaging features distinguishing proven lethal and non-lethal PC. Deeply incorporated in the study are tests of signals in tissue, blood and other body fluids.

Gliomas are a heterogeneous group of tumours that arise from abnormally altered neuro/gliogenesis within the developing and adult brain. Many putative genetic and epigenetic drivers of glioma have been identified through systematic genome-wide analysis; however, it remains unclear which of these are priorities for the development of new therapeutics. Furthermore, the significance of inter-tumoural genetic heterogeneity remains largely unexplored. Functional genetic studies are urgently required to systematically define the roles and interactions of genes and pathways disrupted in gliomas, using disease-relevant patient-derived cellular models across the disease spectrum. The GCGR will create and link a pipeline of carefully generated, stored and annotated patient derived cellular materials across the whole glioma disease spectrum, as well as the cellular genetics toolkit that will enable researchers to perform high-quality interrogative and discovery science. This can be achieved only via coordinated efforts between CRUK Centres and national/international collaborators, required to collect sufficient diversity of samples and share the significant workload. Edinburgh/UCL investigators, and other researchers included in our national/international network, have an outstanding track record, complementary expertise, and access to large patient numbers. Only with CRUK infrastructure funding, such as this Accelerator Award, can this critical resource be developed. Our plans are ambitious, but realistic given the longer-term nature of the award and our commitment to sustaining the infrastructure in the long term. We request support across five key elements to develop: (1) Primary glioma stem cell lines from tumours (with detailed molecular pathology), (2) Primary neural stem and progenitor controls, (3) Genome editing core facilities and novel engineered human patient-derived cellular models (phenotypic reporters), (4) An integrated open access database for the cellular genetic toolkit and the molecular annotation. (5) New PhD studentships to link with developmental neurobiologists at the Crick. New dedicated technical posts are needed across these different elements. The emphasis will be on quality and carefully curated cellular materials, engineered variants, genome-wide genetic and epigenetic annotation. We will ensure that these reagents and matched datasets will be available to the community in an open access format. We would like to cement links with the world-class neurobiology expertise at the Crick and UCL Neuroscience. We request two shared non-clinical PhD studentships specifically for this purpose. PhD students will be led by Crick researchers and co-supervised by Edinburgh or UCL group leaders.	Cancer Research UK	None	None	None

However fine mapping these disease associations and resolving specific functional variants has proved a significant roadblock in the field. This is made more challenging at this locus due to the remarkably polymorphic nature of the MHC and extensive coinheritance or linkage disequilibrium between variants. There is also a need for a more integrated approach to the resolution of genetic determinants of common disease, recognising the importance of epigenetic mechanisms and context-specific regulation of gene expression. Here we propose to define functionally important genetic variants modulating gene expression for common autoimmune disease associated haplotypes spanning the MHC. We know that there is significant heritable variation in gene expression involving the MHC. Our data from lymphoblastoid cell lines HLA-homozygous for HLA-A1-B8-Cw7-DR3, A3-B7-Cw7-DR15 and A26-B18-Cw5-DR3-DQ2 demonstrates that haplotype-specific differences in gene expression are common and often involve differences in alternative splicing. We propose to extend this analysis to carry out transcript profiling using RNA-seq for B lymphocytes and monocytes from HLA-homozygous healthy volunteers selected by genotype for eight common autoimmune disease associated haplotypes. These haplotypes were completely re-sequenced as part of the MHC Haplotype Project and are strongly implicated in autoimmune diseases including type I diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis. We will then confirm haplotype-specific differences and define specific local (likely cis-acting) or distant (likely trans-acting) variants by expression quantitative trait mapping combined with allele-specific transcript quantification. Specific regulatory variants will be characterised in the context of the local regulatory landscape based on chromatin profiling together with reporter gene analysis, assays of protein-DNA interactions, small interfering RNAs and assays to define allele-specific expression of alternatively spliced isoforms. Our analysis of transcription will be complimented by epigenetic profiling to define haplotype-specific differences in DNA methylation involving the MHC. This work will provide unique insights into the functional basis of observed associations with autoimmune disease for commonly occurring haplotypes in European populations. This has significant translational importance in advancing our understanding of disease pathogenesis and defining patients at risk of disease or most significantly benefiting from specific therapies.

In most cases, associations involve regulatory DNA and the specific modulated gene(s), pathways and mechanism of action remain unresolved, limiting translational utility. The goal of this research is to determine the functional basis for genetic associations with AS to advance understanding of disease pathogenesis and define opportunities for therapeutic intervention. We propose a study design adopting functional immunogenomics approaches and focused on primary cells and tissue samples relevant to disease. We will integrate GWAS for AS with our recent data mapping regulatory variants associated with differential gene expression; generate genome-wide maps of physical interactions between AS GWAS variants and target genes using high throughput chromosome conformation capture; and map the epigenomic landscape of AS in which variants act by DNase I hypersensitivity mapping to resolve regulatory elements, analysis of histone modifications, DNA methylation, short and long non-coding RNAs and epigenetic regulators to interpret disease-associated genetic variants. We will functionally characterise specific disease-associated loci including HLA-B27, CARD9 and a gene desert at chr21q22. We will use this functional epigenomic approach to enable novel drug target identification and opportunities for drug repurposing in AS.

309	Prof Sir Doug Turnbull	Newcastle University	Research, Strategy & Development	2008-10-01	2014-06-30	University of Newcastle Centre for Brain Ageing & Vitality supported by BBSRC, EPSRC, ESRC and MRC	The MRC Centre for Brain Ageing and Vitality will develop innovative, world-class research and training related to brain ageing and frailty. The MRC Centre will be a partnership with Newcastle University and will be based in new purpose built laboratory space. The strategic added value from the MRC Centre for Brain Ageing and Vitality will come from targeted expansion of the interface between basic biogerontology and clinical brain ageing and by developing new programmes to address the relationship between the healthy ageing brain and the healthy ageing body. By focusing on vitality we will emphasise the considerable potential to deliver major benefits to patients and the general public, as well as reductions in the health and social care costs of an ageing population. The programme on brain ageing will address the following questions: what are the mechanisms of neuronal loss and dysfunction associated with age, how do these mechanisms vary between different neuronal populations and what role do mitochondria play in these processes; what are the links between mechanisms of intrinsic ageing and neurodegeneration/vascular disease, and how is this relationship affected by age-related changes in the neurovascular environment; what is the mechanism and importance of ageing of glial and stem cells? The programme on brain ageing will make use of the extensive (i) Newcastle Brain Tissue Resource (snap frozen and fixed tissue from 1000+ mostly older individuals) and (ii) a dedicated aged mouse unit. The programme on lifelong health and vitality will address the following research questions: what are the mechanisms involved in the protective effect of different forms of exercise on musculoskeletal ageing in terms of physiology, mitochondrial function and muscle/joint pathology; what is the impact of nutritional factors on musculoskeletal and brain ageing with particular emphasis on epigenetic and genetic modifications of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes? To achieve this we will build capacity in exercise physiology, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, in vitro biochemical and molecular methods and nutrition. The MRC Centre?s training programme will include integrated MRes/PhD for 12 students, development of an E-learning MRes, innovative workshops and public lectures. We will work closely with stakeholders and will build elements of research into the process of public engagement into our activities.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	4811779.0	GBP

To do this, we will use the recently developed high throughput, bisulphite-sequencing (BS-Seq) method. We will use both diet and supplementation methods to restrict or increase intake of folic acid. Neurulation stage embryos from wild type or NTD mutant animals will be investigated for locus specific, genome wide effects on DNA methylation (epigenome). Male and female animals will be analysed independently in order to investigate sex specific differences. Candidate regions undergoing treatment specific epigenetic effects will be independently verified and investigated in additional mouse strains with different NTD causing mutations (e.g. Curlytail) or down regulation of the folate cycle (Mthfrnull). Global gene expression changes will be evaluated using RNA-seq and gene specific changes of interest confirmed using RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. Our experiments have been designed to generate the most reliable data possible by ensuring we use appropriate intra-experimental controls, e.g. wild-type animals versus mutant animals and using an appropriate number of samples in each arm of the experiment, e.g. 2 wild-type DNA samples and 2 mutant DNA samples. Experiments will be performed according to protocols we have already standardized. We have developed the appropriate expertise in our labs at ICH and KCL to be able to effectively carry out each of the techniques described for this project. The use of animals to achieve the objectives is necessary as there is no alternative way to reproducibly study the developmental time points in known affected and unaffected human samples. The mouse is a validated and widely used model for the study of human embryology. We aim to use as many animals as needed to achieve a robust data output and will consider in vitro alternatives where appropriate.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	439060.0	GBP

Methylation is now known to be a key epigenetic change for a number of genes in different cancers. This application is a contribution to our overall studies on gene methylation in colorectal and certain other cancers, and in intestinal metaplasias. For this analysis we use a panel of nearly 100 already well characterised colorectal cancer derived lines. Micro-array gene expression differences between control and 5 aza -2 deoxy- cytidine(5aza2) treated cell lines are being used to search for genes whose expression is likely to be affected by methylation. The methylation patterns in the promoter regions of selected genes are then established using the MassArray technology.This provides direct estimates of the extent to which each CpG in an island in the promoter region is methylated. The pattern of methylation can then be correlated with mRNA and protein expression of the gene to establish its functional relevance. The associations between the genetic and epigenetic changes can be correlated with each other and appropriately clustered to define functional pathways that are changed in the cancers. We have shown that methylation control of CDX1 is most probably a key step in the initiation of intestinal metaplasia and an important early step in a significant proportion of colorectal cancers. Gene expression differences between various sources of CDX1 expressing and non expressing cell lines are being used to search for genes that are regulated down stream by CDX1, as well as by its partner, CDX2. This has provided evidence for Keratin 20 as being CDX1 controlled .The expression of Keratin20 is associated with several other potential markers of differentiation.It appears likely that these patterns of expression reflect the difference between cancer stem cells in the cultures, which do not generally express these markers, and the progenitor cells derived from the cancer stem cells , which do. We are now using these patterns of expression to explore the characterisation of cancer stem cells in our cell line panel.	Cancer Research UK	Studentship	None	None

In yeast and mammals, epigenetic changes are the primary cause of ageing and age-related phenotypes. Ageing involves changes in both genome stability and gene expression which can be ameliorated by caloric restriction. We have characterised a new nutrient sensitive signalling pathway that controls ageing and involves the TORC1, Sch9 and Snf1 kinases and changes in the activity of Gcn5, an acetyltransferase. Gcn5 is found within two differentially regulated complexes known as SAGA and SLIK. The S LIK complex is important for longevity and influences (increases) both chronological (CLS; the viability of post-mitotic cells) and replicative lifespan (RLS;the number of times a cell can divide). The purpose of this work is (i) to understand how the nutrient-regulated TORC1-dependent pathway differentially controls SAGA and SLIK (ii) to ask how protein modifications deposited by SAGA or SLIK influence gene expression by analysing nutrient-dependent modifications on histone H3 (iii) to ask if s ignalling through the TORC1 pathway is linked to the formation of chromosomal domains at the rDNA locus and other sites throughout the genome and (iv) to determine the influence of nutrient signalling and the formation of chromosomal domains on genome stability.

315	Professor Charles Coombes	Imperial College London	None	2008-04-01	2013-03-31	Small Molecule Cancer Drug Discovery Programme Grant	We propose to create a pipeline for small molecule anti-cancer drug discovery and development. Initial focus will be on the evaluation of 4 targets currently in the drug development phase. We have focussed on areas that exploit existing biological and clinical expertise in cancer relevant areas at IC: transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of gene expression, particularly as related to hormone-dependent signalling pathways in breast and prostate (Bevan/Waxman) cancer, and stress responses or resistance to current chemotherapies. One target (CDK7) is the ?Lead Optimisation' phase, with sets of compounds already selected for optimisation on the basis of biological screens. Following the move to London of Professor Brown, we have one ?hit to lead' project: the methylation/ MBD programme. We have synthesised preliminary sets of compounds, following the award of the Medicinal Chemistry Training award, targetted against the molecular target SIRT1 and we will start research on LRH-1 in October 2007. These projects will be in the ?CADD-directed Hit Generation' phase. We have two targets in reserve for hit generation (TDG and GNMT); these have come from our CR-UK programmes on endocrine therapy of breast cancer and epigenetics of drug resistance. All these targets are implicated in resistance to therapy in breast and prostate cancer. We will utilise the strengths of Medicinal Chemistry (Barrett), and protein crystallography/structural biology (Freemont). The programme will dovetail with CR-UK programme grant support for breast cancer biology (Coombes), drug resistance & pharmacodynamics (Brown), molecular imaging (Aboagye), and will be further supported by the IC CR-UK Medicinal Chemistry studentship programme (Barrett, Coombes) and the recently-awarded ECMC programme (Coombes/Seckl), which will provide the necessary translational underpinning as leads are taken into the clinic.

316	Professor Rosalind John	Cardiff University	None	None	2013-03-31	Dissecting an epigenetic process that extrinsically govern fetal size	We have previously shown that genetic loss of expression of one imprinted gene, Cdkn1c, initially provides a significant growth advantage to the embryo. However, this advantage is not maintained later in embryogenesis. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that at least one other imprinted gene sharing the same imprint control region as Cdkn1c is required to compliment the intrinsic growth advantage provided by imprinting Cdkn1c. We have identified two candidate genes that may perform this function: Phlda2, which encodes a rheostat for placental growth, and the adjacent gene Slc22a18, which encodes an organic cation transporter. In this proposal we aim to test our hypothesis by Characterising the developmental consequences of the combined alteration in Phlda2 and Slc22a18 in our existing transgenic model Genetically rescuing excess expression of Phlda2 to isolate the individual contribution of Slc22a18 and, by inference, also Phlda2 Performing a series of experiments to test the functional capacity of the Phlda2- deficient placenta This last objective will be achieved by providing a tetraploid Phlda2-deficient placenta to an embryo with an intrinsic growth advantage and characterising fetal growth. By using a Cdkn1c-deficient embryo, in addition to testing our hypothesis, we will also distinguish the phenotypic consequences of loss of Cdkn1c expression in the embryo from loss of expression in the placenta. This work will further establish the role of imprinting in the subtle interplay between the intrinsic potential of the embryo and functional capacity of the placenta required for optimal growth.

Mothers are exposed to very high levels of placental hormones during pregnancy. Data from animal models suggest that these hormones are important for maternal behaviour. Several imprinted genes regulate the endocrine compartment of the placenta suggesting a role for placental epigenetics in maternal behaviour. We will examine maternal behaviour in an animal model in which the endocrine compartment of the placenta is compromised by genetically altered expression of an imprinted gene. In preliminary work, we find that wild type females change their behaviour towards their pups and show altered brain gene expression in response to our placental mutation. Concurrently, we will undertake a study examining the expression of imprinted genes and hormones in term placenta from women assessed for symptoms of depression (Edinburgh Depression Scale) and anxiety (Spielberger State/Trait Index) before and immediately after delivery. We will initially apply targeted RNAseq and pyrosequencing to a set of discovery placental samples representing extreme moods to obtain further evidence that imprinted genes and placental hormones are aberrantly expressed. Our pilot data identified significantly altered placental expression of an imprinted gene and placental lactogen associated with prenatal depression. Finally, we will bring these two projects together to test the function of the most promising candidate gene identified in our human study in the experimental protocol established using our current animal model. At the end of this study we will have a list of gene changes associated with maternal mood disorders and experimental evidence that these play a causal role.

This project is concerned with the question of why painful conditions should persist over many years, despite the fact that the initial injury or disease has remitted. It is a phenomenon commonly observed in the clinic, where patients might for instance be plagued by back pain long after the initial sports injury healed. What is known is that their nervous system appears to have adopted a permanent maladaptive state as a result of an initial condition. What is unknown is what molecular mechanisms enable this maladaptive state to persist over long periods of time. This project investigates the novel hypothesis that the emergence of latent enhancers permanently alters the phenotype of the neurons and immune cells involved in nociception - ultimately turning acute pain into a lasting chronic condition. Latent enhancers are regulatory regions that emerge in the genome as a result of stimulation once cell development is complete. They have been shown to occur in immune cells, and I have recently been able to observe their appearance in mouse microglia in a model of chronic pain (Denk et al, Cell Reports, 2016). Based on this work, this proposal aims to answer the following three questions: 1. Do latent enhancers also emerge in neurons, where nociception ultimately takes place? 2. Do latent enhancers display characteristics that would allow them to act as a molecular memory? 3. Does the deposition of latent enhancers have functional consequences? Enhancer profiles ultimately determine cell identity, and post-developmental changes to these profiles could therefore affect cell function in the long term. The results of this work would help elucidate the origins of chronic pain, ultimately facilitating the search for effective prevention or treatment. They would also help uncover generic mechanisms of how the environment can impact gene function in a cell-type specific manner.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	447885.0	GBP
319	Professor Johannes Reul	University of Bristol	None	2010-02-01	2013-01-31	The role of epigenetic processes in mediating the molecular and behavioural responses to stress in the dentate gyrus	Dealing with a psychologically stressful event requires, in addition to generation of the acute stress response, cognitive processing in order to learn from it and thus to be able to respond more appropriately in case of future recurrences. Insight into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying stress coping and stress processing in the brain is clearly vital for the development of strategies to improve the quality of life of humans and animals. We have found that, in the case of a learned behavioural response to stress in rats and mice, this process involves chromatin remodelling (driven by phosphorylation and subsequent acetylation of histone H3 (H3S10p-K14ac)) to induce transcriptional activation in dentate gyrus neurons in the limbic brain which is mediated through concurrent stimulation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and NMDA receptor (NMDA- R)/ERK/MSK signalling mechanisms. We hypothesise that in dentate neurons (1) the psychological stress-activated H3S10p-K14ac epigenetic marks are located in a specific set of gene promotors; (2) establishment of these marks is associated with site-specific lysine methylation and/or de- methylation within H3 tails and de-methylation of DNA of the involved gene promotors; and (3) this complex of epigenetic modifications is required for activation of gene transcription that is critical for the memory formation associated with the stressful event; To test these hypotheses we will use state-of-the-art lentiviral-driven RNA interference technology, chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP), gene promoter identification using gene tiling microarrays (ChIP-chip), and methylomic profiling using microarrays in combination with neuroanatomical, immunohistochemical and behavioural analyses.

We have perfected genetic dependency analysis to examine clonal expansion and wish to combine these methods with assessment of mutations in critical tumour suppressor and oncogenes to understand the genetic mechanisms underlying clonal evolution in pre-neoplastic conditions in gastrointestinal epithelia. We wish to study the genetic factors which control the rate of clonal expansion in sporadic colonic adenomas, in Barrett's oesophagus and in colitis-associated dysplasia. In Barrett's oesophagus we will also use these methods to search for the origin of Barrett's epithelium and examine the efficacy of mucosal ablation therapy on the persistence of mutated clones. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) we will investigate the mechanism of spread of mutated cells in IBD and examine the genetic and epigenetic mutation burden of a cohort of human colitis-associated tumours. We also intend to look for pro-tumourigenic epigenetic fields, particularly of p16, in IBD-neoplasia colectomy specimens to assess the use of genomic changes in predicting cancer risk in IBD and to establish more appropriate markers for the detection of pre-neoplasia. We believe these studies go some way towards detecting the clonal expansion of stem cells in pre-neoplastic lesions in vivo in man. We consider that these studies will enable us to identify and characterise pre-tumour clones in human pre-neoplastic conditions, and to study the mechanism of expansion of these mutated clones with a view to the design of rational biomarkers of an individual patient's risk of disease progression.

323	Professor Robert Brown	Imperial College London	None	2010-03-01	2012-05-31	Prognostic value of epigenetic variability in somatic cells from ovarian cancer patients in SCOTROC1 (PESOS)	Recent studies have shown significant DNA methylation variation in non-cancerous cells across unrelated individuals which may be associated with cancer risk. Examples include, methylation of an intragenic element within the ATM gene in bilateral breast cancer cases and transgenerational inheritance of DNA methylation at cancer susceptibility loci, such as MLH1, in HNPCC patients. We hypothesise that inter-individual DNA methylation variation may provide prognostic value in determining clinical outcome of cancer patients. We propose to test this by examining DNA methylation by bisulphite pyrosequencing and differential methylation hybridisation in peripheral blood cells previously collected from over 950 patients enrolled in the SCOTROC1 trial (Phase III comparison of paclitaxel-carboplatin versus docetaxel-carboplatin as primary chemotherapy for stage Ic-IV epithelial ovarian cancer). We will investigate three groups of targets: (1) methylation variable intragenic repetitive elements across the ATM gene (2) identified variable regions within candidate genes such as MLH1, ESR1, PGR, (3) CpG island loci that are candidate germline epimutations, such as MLH1, MSH2 and IGF2 imprinting region. Association between methylation and response, progression-free and overall survival will be sought. In addition, novel methylation patterns will be identified using a customised microarray of 60K loci in a sub-set of patients compared to age-matched controls.

324	Professor Robert Brown	University of Glasgow	None	2005-04-01	2007-03-31	Preclinical Development of RSG 108, a novel non-nucleotide inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases	The vast majority of tumour types show aberrant CpG island methylation. Since such aberrant methylation of tumour suppressor and pro-apoptotic genes is only very rarely observed in normal cells, drugs which reverse DNA methylation of CpG islands should only alter expression of these genes in tumour cells and not in normal cells. Genetic inactivation of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) in tumour cells leads to reversal of CpG island methylation and re- expression of epigenetically silenced genes. Thus, aberrant CpG island methylation is a well validated target for the development of anticancer agents. Nucleoside DNMT inhibitors show anti-tumour activity in clinical trials, especially in haematological malignancies. However, a limitation of nucleoside inhibitors in obtaining maximal biological effect, especially in combination studies in solid tumours, is their myelosuppressive activity. Non-nucleoside inhibitors which do not require incorporation into DNA should be less myelosuppresive and potentially have different mechanism of action and hence more specific effects on epigenetic silenced genes than nucleoside inhibitors. In collaboration with Dr Frank Lyko (DKFZ, Heidelberg) we are examining RG108 as a demethylating agents and its potential as a novel anticancer agent. RG108 is a non- nucleoside inhibitor of (DNMT) initially identified in silico from the NCI compound collection and subsequently shown to have in vitro methyltrasferase inhibitory activity and to reverse epigenetic silencing of genes in human cells cause by CpG island methylation. However, the compound does not affect the methylation of pericentric satellite sequences. These results indicate that RG108 is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor with fundamentally novel characteristics.	Cancer Research UK	Project Award	None	None
325	Professor Robert Brown	Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine	None	2011-10-01	2016-09-30	Mechanisms of Drug Resistance and Epigenetic Regulation	Background Drug resistance is a major obstacle to the successful treatment of cancer. Understanding mechanisms of drug resistance, and how they emerge, will be important for novel strategies to improve the treatment of cancer patients. Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, are important drivers influencing chemo-responsiveness of tumours and acquired drug resistance, although we still have a poor understanding of how aberrant DNA methylation occurs in tumours. Although drug resistance can be overcome using epigenetic therapies in experimental models, clinical studies have highlighted the challenges of current epigenetic therapies for solid tumours and the need to identify more targeted approaches. Aims and objectives • We will examine whether DNA damage repair causes aberrant DNA hypermethylation in endogenous sequences in tumours and investigate whether DNA mismatch repair influences DNA methylation during acquisition of drug resistance and/or at sites of DNA damage. • We have shown the potential of DNA methylation of Wnt pathway genes in determining clinical outcome in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). We will investigate correlation between epigenetic regulation of Wnt pathways (and other emerging prognostic pathways epigenetically regulated), clinical outcome, and pathway function in EOC. • We will characterise candidate drivers of cisplatin resistance in EOC by investigating functional effects on chemosensitivity and methylation changes occurring in matched tumours and plasma before and after chemotherapy. • Histone methyltransferases (HKMTs) have a key role in the maintenance of drug-resistant tumour-sustaining (stem cell) subpopulation of cells. We will investigate the phenotypic consequences of HKMT inhibition in ovarian tumour cells and sustaining subpopulations. Our approach will remain translational: identifying validated targets and novel therapy strategies which can be taken through experimental models into clinical studies. We will focus on ovarian cancer; although as appropriate include collaborative studies on other tumour types. Methods We will place emphasis on identifying clinically relevant biomarkers in well annotated tumour samples. To understand function of biomarkers we will use ovarian cell lines and cells grown ex vivo directly from patient tumour, as well as cell subpopulations isolated by flow cytometry. We will use a variety of established methods of epigenetic analysis, including bisulphite sequencing, differential methylation hybridization, ChIPseq, SiRNA knock-down amongst others. How results will be used Our long-term aims are to characterise epigenetic changes that affect tumour progression and acquired drug resistance, and that can inform clinical trial designs using stratification biomarkers and identify targets for novel therapeutic approaches to improve patient survival.

326	Professor Karim Labib	University of Dundee	None	2013-10-31	2018-03-31	Chromosome Replication and the Regulation of Genome Integrity	My group aims to understand how the molecular machinery at DNA replication forks allows eukaryotic cells to preserve their highly complex chromosomes from one generation to the next. One of the most important challenges for proliferating cells is to make a single and precise copy of each chromosome before cell division. In eukaryotes this is a particularly complex task, involving the duplication of vast amounts of DNA, the reproduction of epigenetic chromatin modifications along each chromosome, and other tasks such as the establishment of cohesion between the two sister chromatids that are the products of replication. For these reasons, chromosome replication is one of the most complex and fascinating of all cellular processes in eukaryotes, with mechanisms and regulation that are still understood poorly in all species. A better understanding of chromosome replication is particularly important from the viewpoint of human cancer, since defects in chromosome replication are a very early feature in cancer development, providing a target for the future development of new therapies that might selectively kill cancer cells. Many of the proteins involved in chromosome replication associate with each other to form a multi-protein assembly known as the replisome, which physically connects the essential DNA helicase that unwinds the parental duplex, to the DNA polymerases and other factors. My group is focussed on defining the nature of eukaryotic replisome, understanding its mechanisms of action, and studying its regulation by post-translational modifications. Most of the proteins that we study have a single orthologue from humans to yeast, reflecting the very high degree of conservation of the eukaryotic replisome, and indicating the value of using simple experimental systems. Our work exploits the unique advantages of budding yeast for studies of chromosome replication, combining state of the art biochemical and genetic techniques, but we are also extending our work into other species where appropriate, including mammalian cells.

We have identified specific target genes which are down regulated by PLU-1/JARID1B, and shown that the protein binds to the promoters of some of the target genes (e.g. BRCA1 and metallothionein genes). The promoters of other important target genes (G2M and spindle checkpoint genes), have not been examined. Very recently it has been shown that PLU-1/JARID1B can specifically de-methylate tri-methylated H3K4: H3K4me3 is normally associated with active transcription, and PLU-1/JARID1B is the first protein to be identified which can demethylate H3K4me3. This pilot project aims to: 1) document whether of PLU-1/JARID1B can bind to the promoters of the checkpoint genes and 2)initiate studies analysing the methylation and acetylation status of the promoters which bind PLU-1/JARID1B. These studies will identify the target genes which are appropriate for the study of epigenetic regulation of gene expression by PLU-1/JARID1B and will lay the foundation for a wider study of control of gene expression by PLU-1/JARID1B in breast cancer	Breast Cancer Now	Pilot	None	None

A non-invasive test for the detection of bladder cancer in urinary sediment cells	Cystoscopic investigation for bladder cancer in patients with haematuria and in patients requiring surveillance for recurrent disease incurs a cost to UK healthcare estimated at £55.39 million per year ranking bladder as one of the most expensive cancers to manage. We have developed a highly multiplexed targeted sequencing assay (UroMark) to detect cancer specific epigenetic alterations in urinary sediment, along with a home collection kit allowing the collection of urine through the postal system. The UroMark assay utilises a micro-droplet PCR platform (RainDance Technology) which allows the analysis of a panel of 150 epigenetically altered loci which accurately discriminate between tumour and normal urothelium. Proof of concept testing has shown the potential utility of this assay for the detection of bladder cancer in urinary sediment cells. The aim this project is to validate the UroMark assay through two non-IMP clinical trials. DETECT I, will determine if the assay can rule out bladder cancer in patients with haematuria and DETECT II will validate the diagnostic accuracy of the test in a cohort trial enriched for low grade cancer. Our aim is to show sufficient diagnostic precision to replace cystoscopy in the evaluation of patients with haematuria. The incorporation of a highly sensitive and specific assay will revolutionise bladder cancer pathways, have a profound impact on the requirement for cystoscopy and on patient well being and, reduce the healthcare costs associated with investigation of haematuria and surveillance for disease recurrence.

329	Dr Rebecca Reynolds	University of Edinburgh	None	None	2008-09-30	Epigenetic modification of glucocorticoid receptors by early life events	Epidemiological studies have shown that early life events influence susceptibility to later cardiometabolic disease. Although the mechanisms are unknown, recent interest has highlighted the potential role of epigenetic changes which may have widespread implications for prevention of adult disease. In animal models we have demonstrated that epigenetic changes in genes involved in glucocorticoid metabolism and signalling are an important candidate mechanism for fetal programming. In previous studies in Motherwell, Scotland we have followed a cohort of individuals whose mothers ate a high protein, low-carbohydrate diet (similar to the Atkins diet) in pregnancy. Such a dietary exposure in utero was associated with altered cortisol stress responsiveness in adulthood as well as higher blood pressure, obesity and altered glucose tolerance. In the current study we plan to translate our findings in animals by studying alterations in DNA methylation in this cohort of young adults whose mothers ate an unbalanced diet in pregnancy.

The histone H3-variant CENP-A chromatin directs assembly of kinetochores at specific chromosomal locations to enable accurate chromosome segregation. Heterochromatin renders potentially harmful repetitive elements inert and silences genes during development. Regional fission yeast centromeres provide an excellent paradigm for unwieldy metazoan centromeres. Our analyses indicate that H3K9-methylation-dependent heterochromatin and CENP-A assemble upon non-conserved elements at centromeres whose chromosomal location is preserved in related Schizosaccharomyces species. My predominant goal is to understand the conserved signals and mechanisms that distinguish these non-conserved centromere sequences from other genomic loci, as well as the epigenetic mechanisms that result in the establishment of heterochromatin and CENP-A chromatin, and their stable mitotic and transgenerational transmission. I aim to determine: 1. How specific signals associated with centromere DNA, RNA, chromatin and RNAPII transcription direct assembly and maintenance of heterochromatin and CENP-A specialised chromatin domains. 2. The influence that positioning at the nuclear periphery exerts on heterochromatin domain robustness and the establishment of CENP-A chromatin on adjacent centromere DNA. 3. The potential for sporadic heterochromatin formation across the genome to generate phenotypic heterogeneity in genetically identical wild-type cells thereby increasing adaptability to environmental changes.

Evidence is mounting that maternal obesity is also a risk for adverse programming. However, exploration of the mechanistic basis of programming is challenging, as animal models of obesity generally use hypercaloric diets based upon a narrow range of pure fats or sugars. These may have effects independently of maternal body composition. A cafeteria diet (a varying panel of highly palatable foods) is known to have a programming effect on glucose homeostasis in rodents, through epigenetic modification and altered expression of the insulin-signalling pathway. This project will utilize an established rat model of cafeteria feeding to investigate tissue sensitivity of such effects and the role of epigenetics in programming the insulin-signalling pathway. The relative contributions of maternal obesity and over-feeding to establishing metabolic and cardiovascular phenotypes will be dissected through cross-fostering and staged feeding experiments.

There are three known components of the epigenome that alter the phenotype without changing the genotype: DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding (nc) RNA. Changes to the epigenome play a major role in the development of human cancers and are particularly evident at the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. Understanding the mechanisms by which the epigenome initiates and maintains appropriate patterns of gene regulation may lead to therapeutic interventions resulting in restoration of cell type. The aim of this project is to continue our studies on the role of ncRNA in the regulation of promoters (Nature, 2007 445 666-70). We will use the tractable genetics in S.cerevisiae to rule out the influence of RNAi-mediated gene silencing and to determine mechanisms of promoter activation and repression by exogenous and endogenous ncRNAs and their role in the recruitment, regulation and turnover of general transcription factors, RNA Polymerase II and chromatin modifying enzymes. We will address whether ncRNA functions in the context of protein complexes, by the formation of stable H-form DNA (a DNA-RNA-DNA structure), or by modulating the activity of enzymes that regulate chromatin and transcription.

Key goals are (1) to analyse existing transcriptomic and expression quantitative trait mapping datasets for primary monocytes activated by lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin) or interferon-gamma from a large cohort of healthy volunteers to identify extreme responders (aggregated and gene level), using genetics to resolve functional alleles then validate and establish functional consequences including through chemical probes; (2) to use genome editing to conduct high-throughput screens in human induced pluripotent stem cell derived monocytes complementing the genetic data; (3) to define key nodal genes and networks for drug target discovery and prioritisation; and (4) to characterise prioritised genes and functional alleles modulating gene transcription and epigenetic regulation relevant to disease. Anticipated outcomes are improved understanding of pathophysiology in immune-mediated disease notably sepsis; exemplars to the field of how to establish mechanism for functional alleles involving regulatory genetic variants; improved interpretation of genome-wide association studies; novel nodal points involving TLR and related pathways as drug targets; and better drug target prioritisation.

The period between 17 and 25 years (termed ‘emerging adulthood’) is a time when many key life events occur with long-term consequences for future cardiometabolic disease, but is relatively understudied.

We have shown that both FoxP3+ and FoxP3- regulatory T cells (Treg) can control autoimmune disease of the CNS in our models of multiple sclerosis (MS). Our aim is to focus on the two key molecules involved in their differentiation and function. CTLA-4-deficient Tg4 mice, expressing an encephalitogenic TCR, either develop accelerated spontaneous encephalomyelitis or are protected from disease depending on whether they are capable of endogenous TCR rearrangement. CTLA-4 balances CD28 costimulat ory signalling: in this programme we will define how CTLA-4 controls T cell repertoire selection in the thymus, the threshold for T cell activation and anergy in peripheral lymphoid tissues, and the generation of induced Treg cells. FoxP3-ve cells are the major source of IL-10 following peptide therapy in our models of multiple sclerosis. Peptide therapy induces a negative feedback loop mechanism limiting Th1 responses through IL-10. We aim to define how IL-10 secreting cells differentiate fr om Th1 cells. In vitro and in vivo models will be used to define cell signalling and epigenetic mechanisms involved in suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines while activating IL-10 transcription.

Mutations in the DNA sequence account for inherited disease in the large part, but increasingly it is being recognised that epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation play an important role. Identifying and understanding the interplay between genetic and epigenetic mutations is important for elucidating disease mechanisms and for developing strategies to identify biomarkers, diagnostic tools and treatments. We present data showing that we can interrogate human DNA methylation genome-wide and we have used bioinformatic tools to confirm known regions of hypomethylation in patients with a well-characterised human growth disorder, Silver Russell Syndrome (SRS). We propose to mine high-resolution methylation data generated by next generation sequencing methods from SRS patients who lack known methylation defects for novel epimutations. Furthermore, we will examine the methylomes and exomes of a group of rare, extreme syndromic growth disorders and a group of common non-syndromic (interuterine growth retardation-IUGR) growth disorders for which the underlying aetiology is poorly understood. With this strategy we will identify novel epimutations and disease genes and characterise associations between methylation variation and genetic variation.

The human MHC is a paradigm for genomics, showing remarkable polymorphism and striking association with disease, but causal genetic variants remain largely unresolved. The identification of specific disease risk variants is particularly challenging in the MHC due to the extent of genetic diversity now recognised, the complexity of coinheritance between genetic markers and the difficulty of resolving specific regulatory variants modulating gene expression. We have previously established the importance of allele-specific gene expression in the MHC at specific loci including the TNF, HSP70 and HLA-DRB1 genes. We now propose a comprehensive global analysis for the MHC addressing the following specific objectives: (1) to define allele-specific transcription across the classical MHC for disease associated haplotypes in specific peripheral blood cells using RNA sequencing; (2) to compliment this by identifying allelic differences in gene regulation at the level of chromatin structure and histone modifications; (3) to resolve DNA sequence variants associated with differences in MHC gene expression by quantitative trait mapping in healthy volunteers; (4) to investigate the extent and consequences of allele-specific DNA methylation in the MHC; (5) to functionally characterise specific gene loci showing evidence of allele-specific gene expression in the context of reported disease associations. The proposal is scientifically ambitious, using cutting edge genomic technologies to address in innovative ways a major roadblock in this field of scientific research. The work is of significant translational importance as we apply genomic medicine to improve care for the individual patient and advance our understanding of disease pathogenesis.

Our studies will bring together four different programmes of LLHW research. Our major mechanistic research programmes focus on mitochondrial and inflammatory ageing mechanisms which will combine well with our on-going interventions programmes in physical activity/exercise and nutrition. To ensure the cross-disciplinary nature of the LLHW Centre, five core activities have been identified which are specifically designed to facilitate extensive interaction between the four scientific programmes of investigation. Core activity 1: Interventions in animal models: development, optimisation and use of exercise/physical activity and nutrition interventions in appropriate mouse models Core activity 2: Human and mouse tissue resource: collection, storage and processing of human and animal tissues from the intervention studies for use in mechanistic investigations Core activity 3: Epigenetics and transcriptomics: we hypothesise that many of the consequences of both mitochondrial and inflammatory ageing, and their modulation by specific lifestyle interventions, will be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms and associated changes in patterns of gene expression. Core activity 4: Capacity building for future LLHW research: key staff appointments and capacity building PhD and post-doctoral training programmes which will be strictly cross-disciplinary in design, involving both the intervention studies and mechanistic investigations. Core activity 5: Public and policy engagement: ensuring impact for our research is dependent not only upon high quality publications but also increasingly on engaging with public and policy makers.

How germ cells form during metazoan development is a classic question of developmental biology. In many organisms primordial germ cells (PGCs) are specified cell-autonomously by maternal molecules, known as germ plasm. In other species, including mammals, PGCs are formed from pluripotent cells in response to extracellular inducing signals. We propose to investigate how germ cells are segregated from somatic cells in embryos from axolotls, a urodele amphibian (salamander). Axolotl embryos do not contain germ plasm, and, similar to mammals, PGCs are formed by induction. Moreover, axolotls are of special interest because they retain basal vertebrate traits, and in this way are instructive for understanding how the mechanisms governing vertebrate development evolved. Here we investigate how the PGCs are segregated from the somatic lineages during axolotl development. We developed a highly efficient in vitro system for inducing PGCs from isolated explants (animal caps) of axolotl embryos using fibroblast growth factor-4 (FGF) in combination with BMP-4, and we show these signals are required for PGC specification in intact embryos. In response to the induction of PGCs animal caps become refractory to TGFbeta signals which direct the production of somatic mesoderm during normal development. The induction of PGCs, and the block to TGFbeta signalling, requires expression of the axolotl ortholog of Nanog (AxNanog), but how these mechanisms function are unknown. Intriguingly, studies with mouse embryos show that PGCs are specified by bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which induce the transcription factor Blimp1. A critical role of Blimp1 is to prevent the PGC precursors from specification to a somatic fate by the local signalling environment, and this is accomplished by the establishment of repressive epigenetic marks. However, we have been unable to detect Blimp1 in natural or artificially induced axolotl PGCs, suggesting that a different mechanism is involved in preventing somatic specification of the germ cells. We propose to identify the transcriptome of axolotl animal caps that are induced to form PGCs, and we will focus on identifying genes whose activation is involved in PGC specification, and dependent on AxNanog expression. The products of these genes will be tested in functional assays. In addition, we will investigate the mechanisms that prevent TGF?O signalling from affecting induced cells. These studies will reveal novel mechanisms that regulate cell signalling during vertebrate development, and will uncover basal mechanisms that govern PGC specification in vertebrates.

Although insight into the genetic lesions in tumours by genome sequencing does already assist in selecting some drug regimens, it rarely results in disease eradication due to the emergence of drug-resistant clones. More sophisticated combination therapies in which several oncogenic pathways are targeted simultaneously or in a particular sequence are believed to hold more promise. However, at present we are unable to extract and interpret the necessary information from tumours to predict which drug regimen will be most adequate. The genetic make-up of the individual, the heterogeneity of the tumour, epigenetic alterations, cell-of-origin of the tumour, and complex interactions between tumour cells and stromal cells appear important confounding factors influencing response. In addition, we are still ignorant of many of the intricate complexities of signalling networks in cells and how tumours exploit these to acquire drug resistance. It is the ambition of the team formed by members of the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI) and the Cancer Genome Project at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI) to unravel the genomic and phenotypic complexity of human cancers in order to identify optimal drug combinations for personalized cancer therapy.

Variability in gene expression is determined by genetic as well as non-genetic (environmental) factors, yet the interplay of the two in defining levels of gene expression as well as the complex regulatory interactions in space and time are far from well-understood. In this study, we take advantage of a large collection of datasets that our group has generated in other contexts to integrate and develop novel insights in transcriptional variability in the population and its relevance to phenotypic variability. Our main goal is to understand some of the key variance components of the transcriptome and its interplay with the inherited genome in an effort to enrich the biological information we obtain from transcriptome profiling and better assess its potential as a biomarker.The project has the following four aims:Aim 1: Genetic and non-genetic causes or transcriptome and allelic expression variation: we aim to dissect and quantify the relative contribution of genetic and non-genetic causes of transcriptome and allele expression variability. This will be achieved by the use of twin expression data as well as joint analysis of genotype, gene expression and epigenetic data.Aim 2: Inference of causal regulatory genetic variants: we will use the full association p-value landscape in the eQTL region, concordance with allele specific expression effects and integration of multiple eQTL datasets in order to pinpoint the candidate causal regulatory variants and assess their likely functional role.Aim 3: Genetic regulatory differences among individuals and tissues: we will use total expression levels and allele-specific expression to compare signals among tissues and individuals for the same tissue. We will also use such information to integrate with Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) in order to identify the tissues where causal genetic effects manifest themselves and that are thus likely to be important in the etiology of the disease.Aim 4: Longitudinal changes of transcriptome profiles: we will profile the transcriptome from twins in two time points to assess the overall change of gene expression profile in time, genetic variants with temporally variable effects, the biological processes and regulatory genes involved in these profile changes and the relative contribution of genome and environment to these changes.

The current programme centres on the RUNX/CBF genes, which can promote or suppress cancer development and are frequently mutated by chromosomal translocations in human leukaemia. The three mammalian Runx genes play essential roles in the development of blood, bone and neuronal cells and are implicated in tumour suppression as shown by loss of function mutations in some human leukaemias and epigenetic silencing in cancers of epithelial tissues (see Nature Reviews on Cancer 2005, 5: 376-87). We have found that the Runx genes can also act as oncogenes when activated by retroviral mutagenesis or expressed ectopically. This dualistic role is due in part to the ability of Runx to drive cell death, senescence-like growth arrest or survival according to context. The mechanisms and pathways by which the Runx genes control these fundamental processes are currently being explored with the aim of identifying novel targets for therapeutic intervention. We are also investigating the possibility of adapting established mutagenesis screening methods to probe the human cancer cell genome in vivo.	Cancer Research UK	Programme Award	None	None

It is a strategic priority for CRUK and CRUK Centres in Edinburgh and at UCL. Recurrent genetic and epigenetic perturbations in glioma have now been catalogued, but we lack functional genetic analyses in relevant preclinical models. This is essential if we are to define critical therapeutic targets for each disease sub-type. A unique opportunity has arisen to enable a step change in glioma research. We can culture patient tumour stem cells, as well as matched normal controls, and probe genetic and epigenetic alterations using state-of-the-art CRISPR-based genome editing. Edinburgh and UCL have expertise in these areas. The time is now right to link each Centre, exploit the combined large patient population base and link to developmental neurobiology at the Francis Crick Institute. Aims: We will create new open access resources – collectively termed the Glioma Cellular Genetics Resource (GCGR). This will stimulate new collaborations by creating much needed cellular models and genetic tools. Ultimately, it will accelerate innovative discovery science and provide new translational hypotheses. Key elements: There are five elements that are founded upon strengths in molecular pathology, glioma stem cell biology, developmental neurobiology and genome editing: (1) Patient-derived primary glioma stem cells: low passage, clinically and molecularly annotated primary glioma stem cells (across subtypes) will be generated, curated, analysed and stored, (2) Primary neural stem/progenitor cell reference controls: foetal, adult and patient-matched iPS cell-derived neural stem cells will be generated and provide crucial isogenic controls for genetic analyses, (3) Relevant genome-edited cellular models: CRISPR/Cas-based genome editing tools will be deployed to engineer genetic and epigenetic disruptions, as well as knock in reporters for live cell/tumour imaging, (4) Integrated open access database/portal; a dedicated ‘gateway’ website will be created, updated and managed, providing a user-friendly resource for all information on patient-derived glioma cells (including their modified derivatives), normal reference controls, clinical/pathological genomic annotation and available genome editing tools, (5) PhD studentships: understanding normal brain development is fundamental to tackling glioma. We will collaborate with world-leading neurobiologists at the Francis Crick Institute through new PhD studentships to provide inter-disciplinary training in the shared research themes of neural stem cells and brain cancer. We provide a few examples of exciting scientific projects that will be enabled and accelerated.

Identification of clinically relevant drug resistance mechanisms provides the opportunity for rational approaches to overcome drug resistance and identify patients who may benefit from treatment. Loss of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) and aberrant gene silencing due to DNA methylation are clinically relevant mechanisms of drug resistance. Approaches to target or overcome drug resistance and novel epigenetic therapies are now undergoing preclinical and clinical evaluation. Aims 1. Chemical genetic approaches to identify novel agents that target cells that have acquired a drug resistant phenotype . We will further characterise small molecules which target MMR deficient cells or reverse epigenetic silencing. We also propose to identify novel molecules which target structural changes in chromatin. 2. Molecular pharmacodynamics in preclinical and clinical trials of novel therapies. We will develop biomarker assays as biological objectives in early clinical trials of epigenetic therapies and new agents entering preclinical and Phase I study. 3. Epigenomic profiling to identify novel drug resistance mechanisms and prognostic biomarkers, particularly in ovarian and lung cancer. We will examine methylation of candidate loci whose function may predict effects on chemosensitivity. We will use global methylation profiling using microarrays to identify novel genes involved in drug resistance.	Cancer Research UK	Programme Award	None	None

In contrast to our familiarity with the structure and mechanism of its bacterial counterpart, the eukaryotic replisome is still understood very poorly and must deal with many other challenges in addition to just copying DNA. We aim to define the composition, structure, mechanisms and regulation of the eukaryotic replisome. Key questions will include how the eukaryotic replisome is able to traverse chromatin so quickly and duplicate epigenetic histone modifications at the same time as copying chromosomal DNA. Another goal will be to understand the complex mechanisms by which the replisome controls its own progression and ensures that genome integrity is preserved during chromosome replication. A further objective will be to undertake a systematic study of post-translational modifications of replisome subunits that only occur in the context of the replisome complex, to understand how these might regulate replisome function both during the normal process of chromosome replication and also in response to replication stress. There is considerable evidence now to indicate that defects in chromosome replication contribute to the earliest stages of cancer development and are an inherent feature of many human tumours. We aim to establish a model system with which to study systematically the nature and regulation of the replisome in primary mouse cells. Our long term goal will be to compare directly the regulation of the replisome in genetically matched primary mouse cells and tumour cells, in order to inform the future use of novel anti-cancer therapies that will better exploit the defects in chromosome replication that typify many human tumours.

However, prostate cancer is difficult to manage clinically, due to a poor current understanding of what dictates its highly variable natural history, and of what underlies the development of castration-resistant disease. The aetiology of this disease and in particular the reasons for ethnic differences in incidence are not understood. There is an urgent requirement to execute a large-scale and highly integrated research programme that will achieve breakthrough advances in understanding the molecular and cellular basis of this disease, including the identification of new biomarkers and drug targets. Specific Aims of Research: We [International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC)-Prostate Cancer] are a group of French, Canadian, US, Asian, and UK investigators. This is an application to fund the UK, Asian, and US members of the consortium. The proposed project consists of a Pilot Study and a Full Study. The aim of the Pilot Study is to set up and test a multi-centre structure that complies with ICGC standards. The aim of the Full Study is to determine the full genome DNA sequence for 250 prostate specimens, mostly cancers. The overall scientific aims are: (i) to understand molecular basis of the clinical heterogeneity of prostate cancer; (ii) to understand the large variation in incidences that occur in different populations and ethnic groups; (iii) to understand the molecular basis of development of castration-resistant and metastatic disease; (iv) to determine whether driving genetic alterations are unique to cancer epithelium or may also occur in morphological ‘normal’ epithelium and stroma; and (v) to subsequently collect genome wide transcriptomics and epigenetic data to provide integrated models of cancer development.

The epigenetic control of gene expression is, therefore, a recent area of interest. Chromatin, rather than the linear DNA sequence, is thought to convey the genetic identity of a cell. Proteins involved in the formation of heterochromatin, the more compact and inaccessible form of chromatin, may also be involved in gene silencing during cellular differentiation and lineage commitment. The Chromosome Biology Group investigates the relationship between chromatin structure, nuclear organization and DNA condensation during regulated gene expression, in order to understand the epigenetic control of genome function at the molecular level. Dividing lymphocytes and developing erythroblasts provide model systems.||We are currently investigating the role of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) in the formation of facultative heterochromatin during erythroid maturation. The ability of erythroid cells lacking HP1 proteins to mature is under investigation. Homology between mouse and human HP1 proteins makes it likely that facultative heterochromatin formation and the control of gene expression will be similar in mice and humans. Antibodies against specifically modified histones (known to be associated with different chromatin states) have been used to compare erythroblasts containing or lacking HP1 proteins. PCR, FACS and microscopy-based techniques are being employed in order to assess the maturation potential of erythroid cells retaining or lacking the HP1 proteins, and to compare their gene expression profiles during erythroid maturation.|||The degree of reversibility of gene silencing and activity impacts on our understanding of gene reprogramming during cloning. Genes are packaged into chromatin consisting of nucleosomes, which can be modified by methylation or acetylation. These modifications have been characterized extensively and correlated with the transcriptional status of genes, but less is known about the functional significance of higher orders of chromatin organization within the mammalian nucleus. Another current area of research investigates the comparative strength of globin gene silencing in lymphocyte nuclei reprogrammed through heterokaryon formation between lymphocytes (in which the globin genes are silent but differently compartmentalized) and erythroid cells (in which the globin genes are expressed).| |It is hoped that an improved understanding of the epigenetic regulation of gene expression and silencing during erythropoiesis will contribute to our understanding of blood cell pathologies. These projects may contribute towards the wider goal of understanding the mechanisms involved in the specification of cell identity during mammalian development.

Centromeres are key regions of eukaryotic chromosomes that ensure proper chromosome segregation at cell division. In most eukaryotes, centromere identity is defined epigenetically by the presence of a centromere-specific histone variant CenH3. How CenH3 is incorporated and reproducibly propagated during the cell cycle is key to understanding this essential epigenetic mechanism. Improper regulation of CenH3 assembly leads to hallmarks of cancer including the formation of extra centromeres, aberra nt segregation of chromosomes and aneuploidy. Recent studies in single cell eukaryotes or cultured cells have identified molecules critical for CenH3 assembly during the mitotic cell cycle, paving the way for investigations into the mechanisms that specify centromere identity, function and regulation in animals. Meiosis is an essential part of the reproductive cycle and chromosome segregation defects result in aneuploid eggs, sperm and resulting zygotes. However, in contrast to mitosis, the func tional requirements, cell cycle timing and regulation of CenH3 assembly in the specialised meiotic divisions are largely unknown. This proposal aims investigate the function and timing of CenH3 assembly during meiosis and early development in Drosophila melanogaster. A major goal is to uncover the contribution of centromeric chromatin to the maintenance of genome stability in meiotic and mitotic cells in multi-cellular animals.

356	Dr Michaela Frye	University of Cambridge	None	2007-02-01	2013-01-31	Functional analysis of the proto-oncogene Myc in adult epidermal stem cell self-renewal and differentiation	The transcription factor Myc promotes tumourigenesis in mice and humans but its functions in non-malignant cells remain enigmatic. Recent studies have revealed a role in regulating adult stem cell homeostasis. Activation of the Myc/Miz1 complex induces exit from the stem cell compartment by directly repressing genes involved in cellular adhesion. Once the stem cells have left the niche, Myc induces cell proliferation via growth promoting target genes like Misu, a novel RNA methyltransferase. I have obtained evidence that during these rounds of cell division Myc and possibly also Misu establish chromatin modifications that might regulate differentiation into specific epidermal lineages. Knowledge of the mechanisms that regulate cell proliferation and epigenetic changes in normal tissues will provide new strategies for cancer treatment. The aim of my proposal is to analyse the epigenetic and transcriptional changes regulated by Myc that trigger the exit of epidermal stem cells from their niche. To analyse the function of Misu in vivo, I will generate a loss of function mouse model. To further dissect how Myc regulates cell adhesion and proliferation, I will analyse dominant negative mutants of Myc. Finally, I will identify chromatin modifications of direct Myc/Miz1 target genes to determine epigenetic changes that might be responsible for lineage commitment in skin.

SV is known to inhibit histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity which may explain the putative chemopreventative effect. HDAC inhibitors are licenced for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and importantly another epigenetic modulator azacytidine is used to prevent malignant transformation of high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. Animal models also support a role for HDACi in cancer prevention activity. Finally epigenetic changes have a proven central role in oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) and its progression to carcinoma. Hypothesis: SV will reduce the rate of malignant transformation in patients with high risk OED through epigenetic modifications.Aims:1) To establish clinical activity of SV as chemopreventive therapy in high-risk OED.2) To explore the hypothesis that SV reduces progression through epigenetic reprogramming.3) To investigate the feasibility and acceptability of a phase III randomised controlled trial of SV chemoprevention. Design:Randomised (2 SV: 1 Placebo) double-blind placebo controlled phase II clinical trial.Population:Patients with OED at high risk of progression to carcinoma (malignant transformation) who have a standard of care therapeutic plan for either close surveillance or surgical resection (patients on either pathway may be recruited).Interventions:Treatment arm: Sodium Valproate 1000mg/dayControl arm: PlaceboOutcomes & Assessments:1) Clinical histological and molecular activity measured using a previously established surrogate composite endpoint which combines changes in:a. Clinical appearance (dimension)b. Histological grade of dysplasiac. Allelic imbalance (3p14 9p21 17p13)This primary endpoint is measured before and after a 4-month of SV or placebo treatment.2) Mechanistic endpoints will explore the hypothesised epigenetic mechanism of action: histone acetylation in circulating white cells and corresponding tissue specific changes in pre- and post- treatment biopsies of the oral lesions. Additionally expression of gene targets in a tissue- & disease-specific panel will be assessed by mRNA transcriptional profiling (Nanostring). DNA promoter methylation most strongly linked with OED malignant progression (P16 DCC EDNRB) will also be studied while downstream effects on proliferation apoptosis and senescence will be assessed by IHC. 3) Feasibility: rates of recruitment screening:randomisation drop-out completion of treatment toxicity. An embedded qualitative study with a purposively selected sample of patients including topic-guided face-to-face semi-structured interviews will focus on patients’ accounts. Sample Size and Analysis:Randomised phase II design based on exact binomial probabilities allowing for unequal allocation ratios: 110 patients randomised 2:1 SV: Placebo assuming 10% dropout.The primary endpoint is response rate using a composite end-point (clinical/pathology/molecular). Analyses shall be carried out assuming a binary response rate with further ordinal modelling carried out should the data allow. Feasibility shall be assessed based on the ability of the study to meet recruitment targets.Economic benefit: reduction in malignant transformation of OED will outweigh the modest costs of SV.

359	Dr Steven Pollard	University of Edinburgh	None	2014-07-01	2020-06-30	The role of SOX and FOX genes in orchestrating transcriptional and epigenetic programs in glioblastoma	Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most devastating human cancers. There are few treatment options and median survival is only around one year. Sequence-specific transcription factors required for normal neural stem cell self-renewal are likely to play critical roles in driving unconstrained self-renewal in GBM. Particularly interesting are members of the forkhead box (FOX) and SRY-related (SOX) families, which orchestrate lineage choice, differentiation and proliferation/survival pathways in the developing nervous system. For example, there is clear evidence that FOXG1 and SOX2 cooperate to establish and sustain the neural stem cell state. Although each of these factors has been previously implicated in human GBM, we have poor mechanistic understanding of their specific functions and key downstream effectors. SOX and FOX proteins are likely to be important therapeutic targets, yet we need to define their precise molecular activities to identify ‘druggable’ effectors. These might be direct protein partners within the transcriptional/chromatin regulatory complex, or downstream transcriptional targets. We will define the specific function, molecular partners and transcriptional targets of candidate FOX and SOX factors in normal human neural stem (NS) cells and GBM-derived neural stem (GNS) cells. Our hypothesis is that in GBM the increased level and/or activity of these factors restricts differentiation, locking cells into a continuous cycle of self-renewal. There are two major goals. First, define the role of SOX and FOX family members in establishing and sustaining GBM. Second, determine the molecular basis of their activity by defining key molecular partners and transcriptional targets. We will use primary human GBM-derived cell lines as a tractable and disease-relevant model. Intracranial transplantation will be used to assess the malignancy of cells following gene perturbation.

Genome editing methods (TALENs and/or CRISPR/Cas system) will be exploited to generate conditional alleles and knock-in reporters. How the results will be used: SOX2 and FOXG1 proteins are important therapeutic targets, yet we need to define their precise molecular activities to identify ‘druggable’ effectors. These might be direct protein partners within the transcriptional/chromatin regulatory complex, or downstream transcriptional targets.

361	Prof Michael Schneider	Imperial College London	National Heart and Lung Institute	2011-01-17	2014-05-16	MRC-BHF Cardiovascular Stem Cell Research Strategic Development Grant	In humans and other mammals, the inability of adult myocardium to overcome cell death with equivalent muscle cell creation makes heart muscle cell number unusually well-posed as a therapeutic target. Notwithstanding a few exemplars, the clinical aspirations arising from this biological limit have led to a plethora of largely repetitive empirical trials with weak outcomes overall, little proven impact on myocyte formation and, typically, weak scientific underpinnings. The need is unequivocal for better, deeper, more systematic knowledge?including genomic, post-genomic and functional characterization of relevant cardiopoietic cells, if a step change is ever to occur in progress towards cardiac regeneration as a workable clinical goal. Inherently, the problem requires a team-based or consortium approach, as is sought by the present MRC-BHF call. This Cardiovascular Stem Cell Research Strategic Development Grant at Imperial College London is a coordinated effort of the National Heart and Lung Institute (NHLI) headed by Professor Michael Schneider FMedSci, an innovative pioneer in cardiovascular stem cell biology, and the MRC Clinical Sciences Centre (CSC) headed by Professor Amanda Fisher FMedSci, a distinguished authority on stem cell epigenetics. Members of the proposed Cardiovascular Stem Cell Research Strategic Development Grant include key experts in mouse genetics, genomics and epigenetics, focused collectively on a series of essential fundamental problems: (1) fate-mapping to define the embryological origin of cardiac progenitor cells and their subsequent contribution to the heart in health and disease; (2) sirtuins and insulin-like growth factor-1 as epigenetic modulators of cardiac repair; (3) chromatin profiling and epigenetic reprogramming of cardiac progenitor cells; (4) high-throughput high-content analyses of cardiac progenitor cell differentiation and function; and (5) next-generation genomics for gene, pathway and chromatin studies in cardiac progenitor cells. A 6,0000 m2 Cardiovascular Research Centre is under construction at Imperial?s Hammersmith campus, adjacent to expanded MRC facilities, and a highly robust recruitment drive is already underway. Apart from the specific questions to be addressed, the overriding goal of this proposal is alignment, integration and capacity-building, establishing an internationally competitive cardiovascular stem cell community that would help lead UK science in this realm and warrant a full-scale Centre in three years? time.

362	Dr Irina Stancheva	University of Edinburgh	None	2002-04-01	2008-03-31	Epigenetic gene silencing in normal and tumour cells	DNA methylation is an important component of the epigenetic changes that occur during the progression of cancer. Aberrant DNA methylation of promoter sequences in tumours leads to stable silencing of tumour suppressor genes and provides the modified cells with growth advantage similar to mutations or deletions. DNA methylation operates through a family of methyl-CpG binding proteins (MBDs) which act as a transcriptional repressors. At present the genomic target sequences for individual MBD proteins have not been identified, neither has it been postulated what, apart from the number of methylated CpGs, may determine the specificity of their binding in vivo. The work in my laboratory is focussed on identification of MBD proteins that are most commonly involved in the transcriptional repression of genes in lung cancer. We are using an approach based on chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to determine the genomic binding sites for the individual proteins of MBD family in vivo in normal and cancer cells. We are also investigating the functional aspects of gene silencing by MBD proteins and their role in the establishment of nuclear chromatin architecture. As a potential approach that may serve as a strategy for an anti-cancer therapy we are investigating whether interference with the function of MBD proteins in vivo leads to re-activation of methylation-silenced tumour suppressor genes. In addition we are trying to address the mechanisms that lead to the establishment of aberrant patterns of DNA methylation during the initial events of tumorigenesis. Altogether our research aims to elucidate the epigenetic controls of gene function and their contribution to the appearance and maintenance of specific tumour cell types.

363	Dr Nigel Williams	Cardiff University	None	2013-12-01	2015-12-01	Whole genome methylomic profiling in Parkinson's disease: an integrated genetic-epigenetic approach	Our understanding of idiopathic Parkinson's has recently been enhanced by large genome-wide association (GWA) studies which have collectively identified susceptibility variants at over 18 loci that increase risk for Parkinson's. However, the biological basis for Parkinson's associations identified through GWA studies remain unsolved. In this project we propose to look beyond the traditional aetiology of genetic mutations in Parkinson's by examining the role of epigenetic mechanisms in the idiopathic form of this disorder. We propose that epigenetic mechanisms can mediate an increased risk to Parkinson's, and in particularly, genotype-DNA methylation interactions can facilitate the increased risk carried by genetic susceptibility variants implicated by GWA studies. This proposal will address the paucity of epigenetic studies in Parkinson's by conducting a series of molecularly robust and statistically well powered analyses to establish whether DNA methylation (DNAm) is correlated with Parkinson's susceptibility loci. We will also investigate whether previously implicated biological pathways are enriched for changes in DNAm, directly following-up our previous observation that variants implicated by Parkinson's-GWA studies implicate genes of shared biological function. Finally, we will also perform the largest genome wide investigation of differentially methylated regions that either increase risk to Parkinson's or are correlated with Parkinson's progression. This work has the potential to impact greatly upon the clinical diagnosis, prognosis and future treatment of Parkinson's. Moreover, given the potential reversibility of epigenetic mechanisms it is possible that our analyses will highlight novel targets for the development of therapeutic interventions for Parkinson's.

364	Dr Nigel Williams	Cardiff University	Psychological Medicine Genetics Laboratory	2016-01-01	2018-01-01	Profiling post-translational modifications of histone proteins as a determinant of Parkinson's susceptibility	Large genome-wide association studies have now collectively identified susceptibility variants at over 28 loci that increase risk for idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, in order to better understand the pathobiology of PD and to ultimately progress to the development of improved therapies, it is now essential that we understand the biological consequences of these susceptibility alleles. Post-translational modifications of histone proteins (hPTM) are an important class of epigenetic modification that control the extent to which chromatin is condensed (heterochromatin) or relaxed (euchromatin). Genotype-epigenetic interactions are relevant to a number of complex disorders, and in a Parkinson’s UK funded grant (G-1309) our preliminary analysis of DNA methylation suggests that it is also relevant to PD. As DNA methylation and hPTM are largely independent biological mechanisms it is important that we now investigate hPTM in relationship to PD. In this project we will therefore conduct a well-powered study to determine whether hPTM are correlated with well-established PD susceptibility loci in pathologically relevant post mortem brain tissue. Moreover, we will also investigate whether previously implicated biological pathways are enriched for changes in hPTM. As hPTM are potentially reversible using drugs that cross the blood brain barrier they are particularly tractable to therapeutic interventions for PD. Identifying hPTMs correlated with disease in the degenerating regions of the brains of PD patients could facilitate the development of improved drugs that target disease relevant changes in hPTM. It is therefore possible that our analyses will highlight novel targets for therapeutic interventions for PD.	Parkinson's UK	Project grant	232404.0	GBP
365	Professor David Mole	University of Oxford	None	2013-05-01	2018-04-30	Target discovery in renal cell carcinoma: hypoxia and epigenetic pathways	Background: Activation of hypoxia pathways mediated by hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) is commonly associated with aggressive cancer, leading to a major focus on understanding whether and how these pathways contribute to oncogenesis. Clear cell renal carcinoma (CCRC) (the commonest form of kidney cancer) frequently bears mutations in the gene encoding the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor (pVHL), which is the recognition component of a ubiquitin (E3) ligase complex that targets the HIF for proteasomal degradation. Consequently, in pVHL-defective cells HIF is stabilised and CCRC manifests constitutive up-regulation of HIF transcriptional pathways - affecting many hundreds of HIF target genes. Thus, CCRC provides a paradigm for understanding the oncogenic role(s) of HIF pathways and gaining insights into the fundamental implications of switching massive ?hard-wired' physiological pathways during cancer development. Despite the general association of activated HIF pathways with aggressive cancer, recent data suggests that specific components of the HIF pathway, as opposed to general activation of the pathway, are causally associated with CCRC biogenesis. We propose that specific transcriptional connections within constitutively activated hypoxia pathways, that are made or broken during CCRC development, are central to the disease. Aims: The overall aim is to define which components of the HIF pathway are pro- and anti- tumourigenic in CCRC, to define mechanisms by which the HIF pathway is modulated during CCRC development to achieve a more pro-tumourigenic balance, and to apply the findings for prognostic stratification and therapeutic development in CCRC. Methods: A series of complementary strategies will be applied including large-scale pan-genomic interrogation of HIF-binding loci, unprejudiced functional and genetic screens to define pro- and anti-tumourgenic interactions, and focused mechanistic analysis of processes enhancing or extinguishing HIF-alpha isoform / HIF target gene expression at specific loci. One particular focus of attention will be analyses of the interplay between HIF pathways and epigenetic regulators that are mutated in CCRC. How the research will be applied: The proposed research will be conducted in an environment, and within a collaborative network, that is well suited to supporting clinical translation. In particular, close links to Oxford's Cancer Centre and new Target Discovery Institute should facilitate analysis of the therapeutic tractability of the research findings. In addition to informing the biology of CCRC and providing new opportunities for clinical stratification and therapeutic development, the proposed work should provide general insights into the role of hypoxia signalling pathways in cancer.

366	Professor David Mole	University of Oxford	None	2016-10-01	2021-09-30	Translating genomic signatures in kidney cancer into patient care	Background: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the seventh commonest cancer in Europe and its incidence is rising. Clinical prognosis is notoriously difficult to predict and although new medical treatments (rapamycin analogues and multi-kinase inhibitors) show some efficacy, in the absence of surgical excision the prognosis of most patients remains very poor. There is an urgent need for better stratification and new treatment strategies. Most RCCs (both sporadic and familial) manifest biallelic inactivation of the von Hippel Lindau tumour suppressor (pVHL), a ubiquitin E3 ligase that normally (in oxygenated cells) targets the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) for degradation. Thus, in VHL-defective RCC, HIF is constitutively activated. New opportunities to study the HIF pathway at the pan-genomic level have revealed the enormous complexity of primary and secondary transcription cascades, and multiple interactions with non-coding RNA networks and protein translational controls that result in thousands of changes in the molecular profile of the cell. Although activation of HIF (particularly the HIF2 iso-form) promotes cancer progression, it has become clear that HIF pathway activation results in multiple pro- and anti-tumourigenic effects and that it is the balance of these activities that is important. In RCC, evolution to a more oncogenic HIF2-driven profile is observed, but even within HIF1 and HIF2 target repertoires there are multiple pro- and anti-tumour activities. It is argued that the ‘co-selection’ penalty of activating anti-tumourigenic components of large pathways imposes a general restraint on cancer evolution, the importance of which has been under-estimated in approaches to clinical stratification and therapy. Aims and experimental strategy: The aims are (i) to define the pro- and anti-tumourigenic components of HIF activation in RCC (ii) to define the mechanisms that modulate this balance during RCC progression (iii) to use this data to define new prognostic algorithms which integrate this data for patient stratification (iv) to define new treatment targets and optimise the use of existing treatments, based on this framework. The pan-genomic architecture of HIF binding and associated chromatin conformation will be defined in RCC cells and patient tumour samples, and interfaced with large-scale cancer genomics databases and parallel sequencing programmes to define germ-line and somatic signatures of selection and epigenetic mechanisms that affect key driver or restrictor components of the HIF pathway. This data will be used to derive and test new prognostic algorithms that focus on functionally important components of the HIF pathway, incorporate complex bi-directional changes in gene expression, and integrate expression and DNA sequence data. RCC-relevant cell based assays (including the use of patient material and genetic engineering of markers at key HIF target loci) will be derived. These cells and other assays (e.g. for HIF1/2 alpha expression ratios) will be used in focussed screens to identify targets and lead molecules that modify the HIF response to generate a less oncogenic profile, and to determine whether, in selected patients, existing agents have the potential to do this. Context: The NIHR chair would enable DRM to capitalise on, and link several major strengths in Oxford, including the University’s recently commissioned Target Discovery Institute, Big Data Centre (due for completion Q4, 2016), the new £109M NHS Cancer Hospital and the regional referral centre for kidney cancer. It would also build on local strengths in hypoxia biology, including those of the applicant. Patient benefit: The work should be of direct benefit to patients with RCC where there is an urgent need to define new methods for prognostic stratification, develop new treatments and optimise existing treatments. It leverages enormous accruing cancer (RCC) genetic databases to develop a framework in which this type of information can be interpreted in terms relevant to the patient.

367	Dr Roderick	Babraham Institute	None	None	2021-09-30	BBSRC DTG Studentship: Foetal programming of cardiac health	The amount of nutrition that the foetus experiences whilst in the womb (in utero) influences how it makes use of the food it receives as an adult. This is particularly important for a foetus that has been nutritionally deprived in utero, which, as a result of too much nutrition after birth develops diseases, including diabetes and high blood pressure. It has been hypothesised that this adaptive response of the organism to experience in utero is determined by changes in the expression levels of certain genes (the copying of information form DNA to RNA then often into protein). As the DNA complement of an organism cannot be changed, this alteration in gene expression is achieved by modifications of the proteins that control the structure of the DNA; i.e. Epigenetic modifications. So far, it is not known whether this foetal programming of adult health affects how the heart grows in response to increased workload or whether there is an increased risk of heart failure. In addition, it is not known if gene expression in the heart is controlled by epigenetic modifications to the DNA generated in utero. In this study, we will investigate whether rats that have been nutritionally deprived in utero are at a greater risk of developing hypertrophy (an increase in cell size without increase in cell number) and whether their myocytes (muscle cells) are more likely to undergo hypertrophic growth following exposure to a particular stress. We will then determine whether epigenetics plays a role in controlling whether nutritional experience in utero impacts upon future cardiac health.

368	Dr Roderick	Babraham Institute	None	2009-06-01	2011-11-30	A study of the epigenetic alterations that result in cardiac hypertrophy	Heart disease is a significant cause of mortality in the developed world. In 2004 it was responsible for 137,700 deaths in the UK, equating to 24 percent of all deaths. A major predictor of mortality due to heart disease is cardiac hypertrophy (an increase in cell size without increase in cell number), and it is the most important risk factor for heart failure in humans. Hypertrophy can however also be a beneficial adaptive response providing the increased blood supply required during pregnancy and to sustain levels of increased physical activity experienced by athletes. Cardiac hypertrophy is characterised by an increase in the muscle mass/size of the heart due to enlargement of heart cells without any proliferation. This increase in heart size is caused by a significant change in the expression levels of a number of genes (the copying of DNA information into RNA and then oftern into protein). This remodelling of gene expression is controlled by factors (transcription factors) that bind to the DNA as well as by proteins that modify the structure and packaging of DNA. In this study, we plan to investigate the mechanisms that control suppression of gene transcription and whether these differ between the poorly reversible pathological forms of hypertrophy and the more reversible compensated hypertrophy.

Specific chromatin structures mediate gene regulation and are required for genome stability and chromosome segregation. Such structures have to be faithfully duplicated for the maintenance of gene expression patterns through development and genome stability. Defects in heterochromatin have been linked to genome instability, infertility, accelerated aging and an enhanced risk of cancer. Despite this fundamental importance, our knowledge how specific chromatin structures, such as heterochromatin, are assembled and maintained through replication is limited. Our recent research implicates an ATP-dependent remodelling factor, SMARCAD1, in the assembly of heterochromatin during replication. The analysis of chromatin remodelling by SMARCAD1 provides a unique entry point to gain mechanistic insights into how heterochromatin is assembled and what happens if this process is impeded. We use available mice that are deficient in this factor and a combination of cell biology and biochemistry to gain insights into how SMARCAD1 and its binding partners are involved in setting up silenced chromatin during replication. We will test if SMARCAD1 has a role in meiosis through its function in heterochromatin assembly. This research will uncover novel mechanisms into how histone deacetylation, histone ubiquitination, histone variant exchange and nucleosome remodelling are coordinated to propagate condensed chromatin structures.

Reclassification of NDs is therefore urgently needed. From a therapeutic perspective, reclassification should be based on causal and druggable factors. BRAIN-MEND will reclassify existing phenotypes using pathway and network analyses within and across complex NDs including Alzheimer Disease, Parkinson Disease, ALS, FTD, Corticobasal Degeneration, MSA, and PSP. We will use three innovative approaches, pioneered or adopted by the consortium: WP1 will apply the latest methods to identify causal genetic factors acting on molecular pathways; WP2 will apply cutting edge methods to identify epigenetic factors associated with molecular pathways of ND; and WP3 will identify drug targets from network analyses using results from WP1 and WP2 without requiring prior knowledge of mechanism. WP4 will use analysis of medical literature and patient records to identify novel or under-recognized clusters of related clinical features. These complementary approaches allow for iterative cross-validation of elucidated factors by WP1-4. BRAIN-MEND will reclassify ND phenotypes based on biologically meaningful categories corresponding to subgroups (heterogeneity) and common pathways (pleiotropy) to enhance disease understanding and facilitate drug development across the entire complex ND landscape. WP5 will manage the project and disseminate results. Patients and caregivers will be intimately involved throughout the project. Our consortium is highly qualified to perform the work proposed, as evidenced by a mean PI h-index of 61, major impact in research in neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatry, direct expertise with and access to a large and rich dataset spanning all complex NDs, track record in cross disorder analyses, and the related tools, biobanks and cell models needed.

373	Professor Eric O'Neill	University of Oxford	None	2011-10-01	2011-10-31	2nd international RASSF Symposium	Since the initial characterization of the first member of the Ras association domain family (RASSF5/Nore1A) of proteins, 10 related genes have been characterized with different chromosomal locations (RASSF1 to RASSF10). Some of the family members are involved in pathways that regulate cell cycle control (RASSF1, 2, and 7), Ras signaling (RASSF1, and 2 - 6), apoptosis (RASSF1, 2 - 6), immune cell function (RASSF1A, RASSF5B/Nore1B and RASSF6) and microtubule stability (RASSF1, 5, and 7). Expression of the prototypical member of this gene family, RASSF1A, is frequently lost in sporadic human malignancies. RASSF1A epigenetic silencing correlates well with silencing of important pro-death regulators, such as caspase 8 and death associated protein kinase (DAPK), and the loss of RASSF1A expression is thought to be one of the earliest genetic changes in breast cancer. Moreover, many clinical studies have highlighted the correlation between elevated levels of RASSF1 promoter methylation and poorer prognosis or response to therapy. For other members of this gene family, genetic silencing occurs in numerous cancers such that there is no expression of the gene and no compensatory increase in expression of alternate isoforms. As a result, loss of function of some of the RASSF family members in different tumour types can result in uncontrolled growth and tumor formation. These observations suggest an important role for RASSF1A (and possibly other members of this gene family) in modulating growth control and in tumor surveillance. The aims of this symposium is to (1) bring together a number of national (Cancer research UK funded) and internationally recognized scientists and clinicians investigating the role played by a tumor suppressor gene family silenced in human cancers; (2) to discuss ideas and share scientific knowledge; (3) to provide a forum for young scientists in the field an opportunity to interact with experienced researchers; (4) to advance our knowledge of the field and stimulate collaborative ventures that will accelerate our ability to understand cancer and other aspects of biology modulated by the RASSF family of proteins. http://www.rob.ox.ac.uk/rassf-meeting-2011/rassf-symposium-2011	Cancer Research UK	Conference & Meeting Support Award	None	None

Our vision is to unify technologies and platforms and re-orientate them in a co-ordinated effort to tackle cancer treatment and prevention. We will focus on reducing the burden of cancer by: improving the identification of high-risk populations; capitalising on advances in metabolic phenotyping; developing novel screening tests; enhancing screening uptake; improving clinical decision-making through machine learning and digital health systems. Our efforts to improve precision of cancer care will lead to improvements in: tumour boundary identification; cancer resectability via medical robotics, augmented reality, and intraoperative tissue characterisation; identification of risk for relapse through lab-on-chip technologies enabling interrogation of single cells, cell free DNA, and microRNAs; prediction of stage and spread by exploiting changes in microbiome composition; treatment monitoring of response and resistance by imaging apoptosis and studying epigenetic reprogramming. The Cancer Research UK Imperial Centre and Imperial Experimental Cancer Research Centre will utilise a broad and unique set of strengths across engineering and the physical sciences, surgery, imaging and diagnostics - underpinned with high-quality clinical practice - to realise a transformative research programme aimed at improving cancer survival for patients and the public.

I propose to ask whether there is a temporal restriction of responsiveness of human ES derived neural stem cells to patterning signals known to be sufficient to induce a MN fate with a focus on the epigenetic regulation of such restriction. Motor neurone disease (MND) is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative condition.There is a great need for renewable sources of human motor neurons (MNs) as an experimental resource to learn more about the aetiopathogenesis of MND and to enable the deve lopment of potential therapies. The ability to generate defined neuronal cell types from hESCs offers unique experimental opportunities to study mechanism(s) underlying neural diversity. hESC derived NSCs predictably respond to morphogenetic signals permitting the generation of region specific neurons including MNs. An unresolved question is whether responsiveness to such signals is developmentally restricted. I will generate enriched populations of MNs (using established methods). Character isation will include qPCR, FACS / IHC as well as functional assays. Our hESC neuralisation system provides an ideal platform to begin characterising the epigenetic regulation of MN specification from hESC-NSCs. Analysis of the temporal responsiveness of hESC-NSCs has several important implications including defining the optimal timeframe for in vitro generation of MNs from hESC-NSCs.

Chromatin structures need to be maintained and need to be re assembled after DNA replication, when the replication fork perturbs chromatin in a profound way. Yet, the concept of 'chromatin structure' is not appropriate. We are starting to appreciate that chromatin is much more in flux than previously thought and that phenomena such as heterochromatin should be seen as an active process rather than a structure. What is becoming clear is that histone turnover rate is an important parameter that governs chromatin function. ATP- dependent nucleosome remodelling factors are key mediators of chromatin dynamics. We aim to unravel how specific chromatin structures are assembled and maintained for gene regulation and epigenetic inheritance by studying the role and mechanisms of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling factor Fun30 in yeast heterochromatin. This will uncover links between chromatin function, histone ubiquitination, histone variant exchange and nucleosome remodelling. Our work indicates that Fun30 regulates the deposition of the histone variant H2AZ, a histone that is involved in transcriptional regulation and that counteracts gene silencing in yeast. We will test using established chromatin immunoprecipitation techniques if Fun30 specifically removes histone variant H2AZ for gene silencing or if it regulates histone replacement in general by mediating a 'churning over' of histones. We will use yeast genetics to dissect the link between ubiquitination, histone modifications and nucleosome remodelling, in particular we will use yeast strains that have point mutations of the ubiquitination sites and mutations of the ubiquitination/ deubiquitination machinery . We will test the direct role of Fun30 in these chromatin remodelling events by reconstitution of the reaction in vitro.

378	Professor Jesus Gil	Imperial College London	None	2018-03-01	2021-02-28	Targeting regulation of senescence in SWI/SNF-mutant liver cancer	Increasing evidence suggests that epigenetic regulators play an important role in human disease, specifically in cancer. The SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelling complex is a master regulator of gene expression that controls chromatin dynamics. Alterations on SWI/SNF components are frequent in many cancer types, amongst them hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, a convincing mechanistic explanation for these recurring alterations is still lacking. By screening an shRNAs library targeting genes deleted in liver cancer, we identified that knockdown of ARID1B delays senescence induction. Our preliminary data has confirmed that the SWI/SNF component ARID1B also regulates oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) in the context of incipient preneoplastic hepatocytes in vivo. As a result, ARID1B depletion strongly cooperates with oncogenic NrasG12V to give rise to liver tumours. We hypothesise that the ability of ARID1B and by extension the SWI/SNF complex to control senescence must be integral for its role in cancer. The aims of this Project Grant are: 1) to clarify the role of ARID1B in senescence; 2) understand whether the deletion of other SWI/SNF components will behave similarly and 3) identify liabilities to target SWI/SNF-mutant tumours. We will use hydrodynamic tail vein injection of transposon vectors expressing oncogenic NrasG12V together with shRNAs targeting SWI/SNF components to study their ability to prevent senescence and cooperate in tumorigenesis. We will identify target genes and pathways conserved on SWI/SNF-mutant HCC. That information will be combined with results from an shRNA screen to identify ARID1B targets mediating senescence. In this way, we have already identified candidate genes (such as ENTPD7, and enzyme involved in nucleotide metabolism) and processes (e.g. nucleotide metabolism, ROS degradation) that we will test to identify potential liabilities of SWI/SNF-mutant cancers. In view of the recurrent SWI/SNF alterations in tumourigenesis, understanding the underlying mechanisms responsible will identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited in novel cancer treatments.

379	Professor Speirs	University of Leeds	None	2008-04-01	2010-03-31	The role of hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase in hormone resistant breast cancer	Tamoxifen (TAM) has been the main therapy for ERa-positive breast cancer patients for nearly three decades and continues to be the choice of therapy for pre-menopausal patients. Clinical studies have shown that around 70% of patients initially respond to this therapy but eventually relapse. Acquisition of TAM resistance (TAMr) is a major clinical problem for long-term management of breast cancer but despite intensive research, there is still no satisfactory explanation for this phenotype. This study will build on pilot data in which we examined the role of members of the prostaglandin-signalling pathway in hormone resistant breast cancer and identified 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) to have the most significant role. We wish to investigate the mechanisms by which 15-PGDH down-regulation (and hence increased prostaglandin signalling) leads to TAMr in a cell-line model generated in house and determine whether 15-PGDH down-regulation plays a role in clinical TAMr and is predictive of response to specific endocrine therapy (TAM or aromatase inhibitors). We will manipulate expression of 15-PDGH in vitro (over-expression and stable knockdown) to evaluate its role in proliferation, apoptosis and hormone sensitivity. We will also examine these effects on relevant signalling pathways associated with proliferation, survival, invasion and motility. We will also explore expand our in vitro observations that 15-PGDH is subject to epigenetic regulation, by applying bisulphite sequencing and methylation specific PCR to clinical samples. We hypothesise that in clinical breast cancer 15-PGDH may be a useful marker of response to specific endocrine therapy and have created breast TMAs with 10 years follow up to allow us to address this by immunohistochemistry. In summary, this project will explore a previously unrecognised mechanism of TAMr and potentially highlight new mechanisms of resistance which may aid patient management and, ultimately, identify new therapeutic targets for drug development.

ERa is by far the better characterised and is an established prognostic marker in breast cancer. ERb was described more recently and there have been conflicting reports as to its biological role. To begin to address these controversies, my group has focused on protein analysis. We and others have shown a consistent loss of expression of ERb in the tumours compared to normal gland, suggesting that ERb may be fulfilling a tumour suppressor role. The aim of this project is to investigate how ERb is lost during breast carcinogenesis. Using paired normal and tumour material, we will address if loss of ERb is due to loss of heterozygozity at the ERb locus, or due to an epigenetic methylation event. This information will help establish the potential importance of ERb in breast cancer development.	Breast Cancer Now	Project	None	None
381	Dr Duncan Odom	Cancer Research Uk Cambridge Institute	None	2015-12-01	2017-11-30	Connecting Cell-specific Epigenetics to Cancer Evolution	To better understand the human cancer genome, the last ten years of clinical cancer genetics efforts have sequenced hundreds of sporadically-occurring human tumour types. These ongoing efforts have led to numerous insights. In particular, even tumours of similar histological origin and classification harbour variable numbers and types of mutational signatures, revealing an unanticipated level of genetic heterogeneity. This has fundamentally altered cancer therapeutic strategies, patient diagnosis and prognosis, and clinical trial design. However, a widely-assumed, yet to date not experimentally well-tested, hypothesis is that human cancer genome sequences must in part be shaped by the starting tissue's regulatory architectures, including open chromatin, transcriptional regulator binding, replication timing, and polymerase binding. There is correlative evidence at the megabase scale that certain epigenetic features may influence the mutagenic landscape of cancer. This award will fund a series of large-scale experiments to map at high resolution the starting landscape and eventual cancer genomes from a representative somatic tissue in a model organism.We expect this set of experiments will provide insight into the regulatory features that help direct the pathways and functional consequences of genome evolution during carcinogenesis.

Previously we have shown that DNA sequence variation is the ultimate driver of regulatory evolution by using an existing mouse model of Downs syndrome carrying human chromosome 21 to place human genetic sequence into mouse diet, lifestyle, epigenetic machineries, developmental processes, and nuclear concentration of transcription factors. Our more recent exploration using this mouse has afforded insight into the co-evolution of species-specific repeats and the control mechanisms to restrain them. Our work has also broadened our understanding of the evolution and control of the noncoding genome. For example, by investigating how RNA polymerase III controls tRNAs in multiple mammals, we have discovered that the polymerases responsible for gene expression appear to be under constraint at the level of their transcripts, the mechanisms for which we are continuing to investigate. In addition, our work has shown how the rapid birth and death of lncRNAs strongly influences transcription of nearby genes. We have explored how repetitive element expansions have been actively remodelling the genomes of most mammalian lineages for hundreds of millions of years by carrying CTCF binding into tens of thousands of new locations, and what genomic features dictate the conservation of CTCF binding in primates. In addition, we have explored how TF binding evolution and gene expression appear to be evolutionarily decoupled and the roles that cohesin can play in connecting TF binding in enhancers with their target proximal promoters.My laboratory has recently reported the first large-scale analysis of mammalian enhancer evolution using functional genomics approaches to profile regulatory activity in tissues from twenty species of mammals.We have also collaborated with groups who are investigating the evolution of non-methylated DNA, alternative splicing, and tissue-specific chromatin domains.Our work has substantially improved current understanding of how and why mammalian genomes evolve, and the functional implications for human biology.

Recently we demonstrated a highly dynamic role of CBG in controlling free glucocorticoid concentrations after stress. In studies on normal and exercising rats we found stark differences between forced swimming-induced responses in total and free corticosterone probably due t o differential changes in CBG levels. Moreover, we found that this stressor evokes a rapid increase in circulating CBG levels concurrent to a decline in liver CBG. Thus we hypothesise that 1. Stress leads to an acute rise in plasma CBG that parallels the rise in total plasma corticosterone thereby attenuating and delaying the exposure of tissues to glucocorticoid hormone; 2. Stress acts on circulating CBG levels through hormonal and neural effects on the liver; 3. In exercising animals the effec t of stress on CBG is enhanced resulting in a cap on the free corticosterone response; 4. Changes in CBG gene expression in exercising animals are due to epigenetic changes at the promoter of this gene. These hypotheses will be tested in an integrative research programme using state-of-the-art physiological, anatomical and epigenetic approaches.	Wellcome Trust	Project Grant	306885.0	GBP
384	Dr. Marjori MATZKE	Academia Sinica	None	2008-06-01	2012-05-31	Genetic analysis of RNA-directed DNA methylation	RNA-directed DNA methylation contributes substantially to epigenetic regulation of the plant genome. Methylation is guided to homologous DNA target sequences by 24 nucleotide 'heterochromatic' small RNAs produced by nucleolar-localized components of the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery and a plant-specific RNA polymerase termed Pol IV. Although the exact functions of RdDM in plants are not entirely understood, it is proposed to have roles in transposon silencing as well as plant development and stress adaptation. We have previously identified several key components of the RdDM machinery in two forward genetic screens based on specially designed transgene silencing systems in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. In these silencing systems, promoter-directed small RNAs trigger methylation and silencing of target promoters that drive expression of easily-assayable reporter genes. For the present study, we have exploited an enhancer active in meristems (stem cells where developmental decisions are made) to assemble a sensitive, two-component transgene system that permits a genetic dissection of RdDM, secondary siRNA biogenesis, and spreading of DNA methylation in a developmental context. We have already validated the usefulness of this system by identifying a novel component of the RdDM machinery, termed DMS3, in a new forward genetic screen. DMS3 is a structural maintenance of chromosomes hinge-domain-containing protein, and it is the first of its kind to be implicated in an RNAi-mediated, chromatin modification pathway. A related protein in mice, Smchd1, has recently been found by Blewitt, Whitelaw and coworkers to be required for X chromosome inactivation, another epigenetic phenomenon involving a regulatory RNA (Xist RNA) and spreading of DNA methylation. In the proposed work, we will identify and characterize additional mutants recovered from the new forward genetic screen, determine the contributions of the identified gene products to regulation of transcription and genomic methylation patterns in Arabidopsis, and begin to analyze their mode of action. The results will be important for understanding how silent epigenetic states are nucleated by small RNAs and subsequently spread over larger chromosomal domains, and they should be relevant for both plant and mammalian systems.

385	Univ.Prof. Dr. Rudolf ZECHNER	Universität Graz	None	2014-04-01	2019-04-01	The Role of Lipolysis in the Pathogenesis of Cancer-associated Cachexia	Cachexia is a complex syndrome characterized by massive loss of body weight due to uncontrolled loss of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. The wasting occurs during late stages of many unrelated chronic diseases and frequently leads to the death of affected individuals. Cachexia is most common in cancer, where an estimated 25% of patients die from cancer-associated cachexia (CAC) rather than from the cancer. Despite the tremendous impact of CAC on morbidity and mortality, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Recently, we demonstrated that lipase-catalyzed triacylglycerol (TG) catabolism is required for the pathogenesis of CAC. Mice lacking adipose triglyceride lipase, the rate-limiting enzyme for TG hydrolysis (lipolysis), were completely protected from loss of both adipose tissue and muscle in two forms of cancer. This implies an essential role of the lipolytic process in the pathogenesis of CAC. Here we propose to elucidate the causal role of lipases and their coregulators in CAC development. We will determine mechanisms involved and pursue novel treatment strategies. Our objectives are to: - Investigate how different cancers in mice regulate tissue-specific lipolysis; - Elucidate the functional role of lipases and their coregulators in the pathogenesis of CAC; - Assess whether pharmacological inhibition of specific lipases prevents or delays CAC; - Study the effects of cancer-induced lipolysis on energy dissipating pathways and epigenetic control. The project enters a largely unexplored field: the role of lipid metabolism in the pathogenesis of CAC. The work will heavily rely on the characterization of induced mutant mouse models with CAC and require extensive collaboration with experts in pathology and large-scale systems analytics. The results are expected to yield new mechanisms of disease development and provide novel therapeutic targets to prevent the devastating and prevalent consequences of CAC.

The patterns of DNA methylation in cancers are modified in a complex manner relative to those in normal tissues - in most cases tumours display overall genome hypomethylation, which is accompanied by the appearance of methylated CpGs in promoter-associated, and usually methylation-free, CG rich sequences (CpG islands). This project aims to investigate the chromatin remodelling properties of SNF-like helicase PASG, and to determine whether PASG is able to recruit de novo DNA methyltransferase activities to gene promoters in cancer cells. The information derived from this research may elucidate the mechanisms underlying the origin of the complex epigenetic changes in cancer genomes and, due to the potential role of PASG as an oncogene, may produce new targets for therapeutic strategies.

Understanding on how and why these mechanisms are altered in many disorders (cancer, autoimmune diseases, ageing, etc.) has become a growing priority in biomedical research. This proposal represents a logical continuation of an existing collaboration between two laboratories funded by the grants from the MRC, NSFC and the UK-China Science Bridges Programme, which is focused on the analyses of roles of distinct epigenetic regulators in the control of stem cell activity during development and regeneration. This project will extend this successful collaboration and will study the role of Polycomb gene Cbx4 in the control of stem cell activity during wound-induced skin regeneration. We will test the hypothesis that Cbx4 plays important roles in the control of gene expression programmes in adult epithelial stem cells during skin regeneration and: 1) Define whether the loss of Cbx4 activity in vivo will affect the self-renewing and differentiation potentials of skin epithelial stem cells and their progenies during wound healing; 2) Identify upstream regulators controlling Cbx4 expression in adult epithelial stem cells and their lineage-committed progenies. Researchers from both labs will exchange knowledge relevant to their areas of expertise (skin/stem cell biology, molecular biology/epigenetics) and will share resources, data and ideas to generate data for large-scale joint grant proposals that will look at epigenetic regulation of stem cell activity in normal and diseased skin. Success of this project will help in better understanding the complexity of regulatory mechanisms that control stem cell activity in regenerating epithelial tissues and in designing new approaches on how to target stem cells in the clinical conditions accompanied by their un-controlled activation/expansion or exhausting/loss.

The long-term goals of this collaborative project are to understand the mechanisms that control the establishment of lineage-specific patterns of gene expression and chromatin organisation in adult stem cells during the process of differentiation into specialised cell types in normal and regenerating epithelia. TET1/2/3 enzymes are a group of recently discovered epigenetic regulators that promote oxidation of methylated DNA and conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). 5mC DNA oxidation is required for gene activation in mammals and plays an essential role in many biological processes including development, cell differentiation and cancer. Here, we will test the hypothesis that Tet1/2/3 proteins are critical determinants that control gene expression programmes in adult epithelial stem cells and their progenies during skin regeneration and wound healing via two Specific Aims: 1) Define the common features and differential impact of the distinct Tet proteins on the self-renewing and differentiation potentials of epithelial stem cells and their progenies during physiological hair cycle-dependent skin regeneration. 2) Identify the role of Tet proteins in the control of activity of skin epithelial stem cells and their lineage-committed progenies (epidermal keratinocytes) during wound healing. This project will provide new important insights into fundamental mechanisms that regulate stem cell activity inside and outside of the skin, and will serve as an important platform for the development of novel epigenetic drugs to target stem cells for the needs of regenerative medicine and stem cell-based therapy.

Bioinformatics will also underpin the genetic, epigenetic and omics association studies that will be undertaken in all of the Programmes. Objectives and plans: Integration of diverse data types, including large-scale “omics” datasets: integration of very high-dimensional omics data to facilitate data mining and specific hypothesis-based analyses. Filtering and annotation of omics association results: integration of internally generated data with public data from projects such as ENCODE, the NIH roadmap epigenomics project and others to prioritise and filter results. Developing approaches for combining variables in omics data: collapsing and dimensionality-reduction approaches will be developed and applied to reduce the computational burden of association analysis between high-dimensional omics datasets. Development of methods for hypothesis-free mining of complex data: using allele-score based approaches to de novo identification of potential causal relationships across a wide range of phenotypes/outcomes. Training in bioinformatics and data-mining: specific training will be developed to build in-house skills in bioinformatics and data mining methodology in the context of high-dimensional data. This theme will further develop the existing core expertise in bioinformatics and data mining to enable Unit researchers to work effectively with the data generated by the Unit and collaborators. The new methods developed will be of broad applicability in the field of molecular epidemiology, and the Unit will train a new cadre of researchers with essential skills in medical bioinformatics.

Silver-Russell Syndrome (SRS) is a distinct subtype of the SGA population with poor fetal and postnatal growth. A proportion of these patients have duplication in the chromosome 11p15 locus which contains the IGF2 gene. This is known to be important in fetal growth with complex control mechanisms for expression including maternal imprinting and multiple promoters. It has recently been demonstrated that up to 30% of all SRS patients have undermethylation in the IGF2/H19 locus with associated reduced IGF2 expression. The hypothesis is that SRS is a result of IGF2 deficiency which is not necessarily secondary to the methylation abnormalities. The aim of the project is look at the methylation status of various differentially methylated regions in the IGF2-H19 locus using EBV transformed lymphocytes taken from patients enrolled in the NESTEGG study and to compare this with IGF2 expression. Methylation status will be examined using bisulphite treatment of DNA in conjunction with either product subcloning and sequencing or with pyrosequencing. IGF2 expression will be quantified using real-time TaqMan assay. An IGF2 ELISA assay will be used to compare protein expression to investigate translation of message. If IGF2 deficiency is more widespread compared to methylation abnormalities, alternative pathogenic mechanisms such as defective promoter function or abnormal histone acetylation and methylation will be investigated. If IGF2 deficiency is shown to be exclusive to those patients with methylation abnormalities, the IGF2 receptor epigenetics and function will be investigated further. Although poor fetal growth is known to have significant effects on cardiovascular risk in adulthood it remains a poorly understood and clinically heterogeneous phenomenon. This project aims to further understand the role that IGF2 and epigenetics may play in poor fetal and postnatal growth.	Medical Research Council	Fellowship	131628.0	GBP

Background The potent growth promoting activity of Insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) is selectively regulated during development, but supply is increased in tumours often because of epigenetic deregulation of imprinting and increased ligand bioavailability. IGF-II signals via the IGF1 receptor, results in activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and conversion of PtdIns(4,5)P2 to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and subsequent activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway, a reaction that is normally reversed by the PTEN dual specificity phosphatase. Either haplo-insufficiency or mutation of PTEN can result in complete or relative loss of both phosphatase dependent and independent functions, and is associated with tumour promotion in murine models and in human syndromes. 2. Relevance to cancer The frequent loss of PTEN function in many tumour types may synergise with increased IGF-II ligand supply, such that selection of specific therapeutic combinations directed at both targets may be required in cancers that have co-existent deregulation of IGF2 and PTEN. 3. Specific Aims of the research The aim is the evaluation of the potential for functional synergy between cancer modifier genes Igf2 and Pten in murine genetic models of tumour susceptibility. 4. Outline plan of investigation The Igf2 dependency and the functional consequence of increased Igf2 allelic dosage on tumour formation in mice heterozygote for Pten will be determined by breeding with either disruption of Igf2 paternal allele (null) or H19 maternal allele (bi-allelic Igf2). Functional synergy will be further evaluated with respect to conditional intestinal adenoma development in the Apcloxp/+ also by breeding, with additional models of conditional PTEN disruption (AchCre/ Ptenloxp/loxp). Further evaluation of the extent of specific phenotypic consequences of loss of Pten function will be investigated in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and cancer cell lines with inducible IGF2 expression.

Mammalian Sterile20 kinases (MST1, MST2) are pro-apoptotic kinases that are central modules in an emerging tumour suppressor pathway. MST kinases associate through a specific protein interaction motif with the Ras ASSociation domain containing family (RASSF). Activation of this pathway results in apoptosis through the DNA damage responsive p53 homolog, p73. Elimination of this pathway would confer a growth advantage that is likely to be a reason for widespread epigenetic silencing of RASSF1a isoform observed in human primary tumours. The plan of research will initiate with a proteomics screen for regulators of RASSF1A/MST2 followed by confocal analysis to fully understand their mode of action. This will be complimented by cell based studies on the involvement of RASSF1A/MST2 signalling in the response to DNA damage by transcriptional activators p53 and p73. Finally the radio-sensitisation of tumour cells by ATM activation of RASSF1A is hoped to set the ground work for potential translational studies towards the end of this grants term.

Most of this research focused only on a single environmental dimension or on a single ontogenetic period. However, natural environments are usually multi-dimensional and complex, which requires an integrative research incorporating multiple ecological factors and multiple ontogenetic stages, if we aim to understand the development of well-integrated adult phenotypes. The highly social cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher is a unique model system to study the development of integrated phenotypes, because it uses environmental cues to specialize on one of two life history strategies during ontogeny, namely early own reproduction or delayed dispersal to help rearing young of dominant breeders. N. pulcher is an intensively studied vertebrate model system for studies of social evolution and is exceptionally well amenable to experiments in the field and in the laboratory under semi-natural conditions. The first aim of this project is to investigate the relative significance of four important environmental influences, maternal effects on eggs, brood care, the early juvenile and the late juvenile environment, for the development of helping and dispersal propensities of N. pulcher. As second aim, I will investigate whether the early environment influences adult life histories and reproductive performance, and whether it impacts the phenotypes of successive generations through epigenetic inheritance. By targeted laboratory experiments and field studies, I will investigate the molecular basis of plastic responses, the epigenetic mechanisms of differential gene expression, the involved ecological factors driving plastic responses, and their ultimate fitness effects. Furthermore I will perform a general meta-analysis to compare the relative effects of maternal effects and direct early-life experience on organismal performance. Both, the integration of environmental information across ontogenetic stages and long-term effects of early social experience within and across generations (i) will enhance our understanding of basic processes of vertebrate phenotypic development and (ii) it will add a so far largely missing developmental perspective to the debates on ecological causes of social strategies in cooperative breeders.

Epidemiological studies have shown that high serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, the precursor of the active vitamin D metabolite, correlate with low incidence of colon cancer. Since the synthesizing and catabolic vitamin D hydroxylases are active also in colonocytes, colonic synthesis of the antimitotic, prodifferentiating active vitamin D metabolite, 1,25-(OH)2-D3, in sufficient amounts could prevent tumour progression and high serum precursor levels could support this synthesis. CYP24A1 seems to be an oncogene that, through as yet not well understood mechanisms, becomes amplified or up-regulated in several malignancies, participating in the onset and development of tumours. We hypothesize that unbalanced high expression of CYP24A1 may result in local deficiencies of active vitamin D, restraining its regulatory functions. Therefore suppression of CYP24A1 should restore and potentiate the anti-tumour effects of 1,25-(OH)2-D3. The main focus of this study is to elucidate the role of CYP24A1 in disruption of the anti-tumourigenic action of the active vitamin D in the colon. We expect to identify the mechanisms causing unbalanced expression of this enzyme and to find remedies that would restore normal vitamin D signalling. Our study will clarify whether unbalanced colonic overexpression of CYP24A1 always results in impaired vitamin D signalling and whether CYP24A1 suppression in vivo would restore or enhance the anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, anti-tumourigenic effect of 1,25-(OH)2-D3 thus providing unequivocal evidence whether CYP24A1 is an attractive and promising target for chemopreventive and therapeutic strategies. First we propose to explore genetic and epigenetic causes of CYP24A1 overexpression in colon cancer cell lines and colorectal tumours. We will evaluate if there is a correlation between CYP24A1 expression, tissue 1,25-(OH)2-D3 concentration, and vitamin D signalling in colon cancer cell lines and colorectal tumours. Then we will examine the effectiveness of CYP24A1 suppression on vitamin D signalling in two mouse models, one with colon-specific cyp24a1 null mutation the other with colon-specific overexpression. We will evaluate the effect of lack or overexpression of colonic cyp24a1 on carcinogen-induced colon tumour formation in mice. There exists enough evidence that the vitamin D system becomes compromised during cancer progression, be it in the colon, breast or prostate. Thus elucidation of mechanisms through which local availability of 1,25-(OH)2-D3 could be enhanced is of prime relevance for the design of chemoprevention protocols.

Cytosine methylation and repressive histone modifications are examples of epigenetic modifications that are associated with genes that are transcriptionally inert, while active histone modifications are associated with transcriptional activity. Little is currently known about the rules that determine which parts of the genome acquire which type of modifications. We do know that the different epigenetic states correlate with the locus being active in some cells and inactive in others resulting in a variegated phenotype. This phenomenon can even extend to the whole organism resulting in isogenic individuals with different phenotypes. In some cases these epigenetic states can actually be inherited through meiosis resulting in transgenerational effects (epigenetic inheritance). In the proposed project a forward genetic approach is planned to be used to identify and characterize mutations in genes that are needed for the establishment and maintenance of epigenetic state in the mouse. Epigenetic phenomena such as variegation, variable expressivity and epigenetic inheritance are not understood at a molecular level and the identification of genes involved in the establishment and maintenance of epigenetic marks will be a start to the characterisation of the mechanisms involved.

Inhibition of HDACs by small molecule inhibitors is a promising strategy in the treatment of various diseases and has been approved for anti-cancer therapy. The highly homologous deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2 play important roles in many signal transduction pathways and are crucial regulators of proliferation, differentiation and development in the mammalian organism. Epidermal development and homeostasis is regulated by a well-orchestrated sequence of proliferation, differentiation and cell death. By using a genetic mouse model with epidermal-specific HDAC1 and HDAC2 deletion we have revealed a dosage-dependent effect of HDAC1/HDAC2 activity on epidermal proliferation and differentiation. Loss of function studies in mice are complicated by the fact that loss of HDAC1 or HDAC2 is at least partially compensated by upregulation of its paralog. Importantly reduction of HDAC1/HDAC2 activity below a critical threshold level results in severe defects in skin development including hyperkeratosis and epidermal hyperproliferation indicating a novel and unexpected function of HDAC1/HDAC2 in proliferation control. In this project we will study the impact of HDAC1 and HDAC2 on development and homeostasis in the mouse epidermis. We will analyze in detail the defects of mice with reduced HDAC1/HDAC2 activity and the underlying deregulated mechanisms. In addition, we will examine in a systematic approach using mass spectrometry, RNA-seq and ChIP-seq changes in HDAC1/HDAC2 co-repressor complex formation and recruitment as well as target gene expression upon epidermal deletion of Hdac1 and Hdac2 alleles to identify the relevant deregulated signalling pathways. The results of this study will enable us to dissect individual and redundant functions of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in the regulation of epidermal cell proliferation and differentiation thereby providing important insights into the epigenetic control of cell fate decisions.

399	Univ.Prof. Dr. Jörg STRIESSNIG	University of Innsbruck	None	2011-03-15	2019-03-14	Coordination project Cell signaling in chronic CNS disorders	Chronic diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), such as fear/anxiety disorders and neurodegenerative diseases occur with high and increasing prevalence. Since molecular disease mechanisms are not fully understood, current drug therapies are often unsatisfactory. The development of novel and improved therapeutic strategies requires the identification of innovative targets for therapeutic intervention. The major goal of this SFB is to comprehensively study two signaling pathways that bear such potential: L-type Ca2+ channels (LTCCs) and epigenetic modulators, in particular histone deacetylases (HDACs). Both pathways appear to participate in the etiology of several neurological disorders. Moreover, recent preliminary findings from our consortium suggest that they can be (patho-) physiologically linked. In this SFB we bundle our strong local expertise to study Ca2+-mediated, epigenetic and noncoding RNA (ncRNA) - mediated regulatory mechanisms to disclose the role of these pathways for the pathophysiology of Parkinsonian disorders (Parkinson's disease, Multiple System Atrophy), Alzheimer's disease and abnormal fear and anxiety. The SFB is organized in twelve subprojects within three collaborative research areas. Area 1 will study cell-specific signaling through distinct brain LTCC isoforms in disease-relevant neuronal subpopulations. This will reveal their normal function, how they contribute to disease processes and will provide clues for specific therapeutic intervention. Area 2 will address the role of chromatin-modifying pathways (in particular HDACs and chromatin remodeling factors) for disease. Several projects will investigate links between LTCC signaling and chromatinmodifying pathways. Since both, LTCCs and chromatin-modifying pathways appear to control glial responses and neurogenesis, their roles for these processes in health and disease will be studied in area 3. Areas 1 and 2 also aim to discover new drugs with improved pharmacological properties to specifically target LTCCs or HDACs. We also benefit from local expertise to reveal disease-relevant signaling pathways mediated by ncRNAs. To study CNS disease mechanisms from the molecular and cellular level, up to intact mammalian organisms, this SFB applies a well-structured multidisciplinary approach. The role of LTCCs and chromatin modifying pathways for CNS disease will be analyzed in suitable mouse models as well as in human post mortem brains via a spectrum of state-of the-art techniques. These include cell-specific gene expression profiling, generation of a novel brain-specific ncRNA chip, chromatin immunoprecipitation, a spectrum of electrophysiological techniques on (organotypic) slices and cultured cells, techniques to study animal behavior, generation of genetically modified mice, as well as structure- and ligand-based in silico modeling. New data obtained by the three research areas during the first funding period will provide us with a comprehensive picture about how calcium and epigenetic signaling pathways contribute to the cell-specific pathophysiology of chronic CNS diseases, and which therapeutic effects can be expected from their specific pharmacological modulation with new drugs.

400	Dr. Isabelle WEINHOFER-MOLISCH	Medical University of Vienna	None	2008-12-01	2010-05-31	Epigenetic profiling	Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic system of transcriptional regulation causing an allele-specific expression of some genes dependent on the parent-of-origin. Genomic imprinting occurs only in mammals and flowering plants and it is generally assumed that imprinted genes play an important role for the distribution of nutrients from the mother to the offspring. Genomic imprinting in flowering plants has long been inferred to play an important role in seed development. However, the mechanism of genomic imprinting in plants is only partially understood and likely involves alterations in DNA and hisone methylation and chromatin structure between the differentially expressed maternal and paternal alleles. Therefore, a central question of this project is to clarify when imprinting marks are established and how are they maintained during endosperm development. We will use state of the art molecular biology techniques to track DNA and histone methylation directly from gametes to different stages of endosperm development, enabling an exploration of the timing of genomic imprinting. Currently, only a small number of imprinted genes have been described in plants. Thus, we will also focus on the identification of new imprinted genes in Arabidopsis. Together, the proposed project will deepen the knowledge of the mechanism of genomic imprinting in plants and will also provide further important insights into the influence of imprinting on seed development. Currently, one of the main focuses of plant research in Vienna (e.g. at the Gregor Mendel Institute) is the epigenetic plasticity of plant genomes in context of gene regulation, chromosome biology and development. Furthermore, epigenetic mechanisms are of substantial interest for medical research as well and are intensively investigated at the Institute of Molecular Pathology in Vienna. Several epigenetic mechanisms are evolutionary conserved, therefore, we expect that the results of the proposed research will not only be of interest to plant scientists but will reveal mechanisms of parent-of-origin dependent gene regulation that are conserved between mammals and flowering plants. Last but not least, imprinted genes play an important role during endosperm development. Endosperm represents mankind's most important renewable resource for food, feed and industrial raw material. Therefore, the proposed research is not merely of academic but potentially also of great economic interest. Thus, the knowledge gained from this innovative research project will be of particular use for the Austrian research done in the field of epigenetics and seed development.

Although major advances in the treatment of MPN have been made in recent years, most MPN are incurable chronic disorders with substantial morbidity and mortality. The only curative treatment approach that can be offered at present is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Unfortunately, this procedure can only be performed in a small group of patients (young and fit). In all other patients, management is largely based on symptom-control and the use of growth-inhibitory drugs. However, most drugs used thus far in MPN, including the recently developed tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), have little if any curative potential. In addition, resistance to growth-inhibitory drugs is often seen in advanced MPN. So far, little is known about molecules, signaling networks, and mechanisms underlying disease evolution, progression, and resistance in various MPN. The situation is complicated by the fact that neoplastic stem cells (SC) exhibit intrinsic resistance, have multiple interactions with the SC-protective microenvironment, the so-called ?stem cell niche?, and acquire resistance in multiple subclones during disease evolution. Finally, the genetic background as well as epigenetic mechanisms are considered to play a role in disease evolution and progression in MPN. The general aim of this research program is to address the cellular, biochemical and functional complexity in various MPN by an integrated multidisciplinary approach, to exploit network analyses and resulting concepts to define critical target profiles in neoplastic (stem) cells, and to develop targeted treatment-strategies. The specific long-term aim of the SFB is to develop novel SC-eradicating treatment approaches in Ph+ and Ph- MPN. Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) will serve as a paradigmatic disease model in this SFB. In addition, the SFB will focus on JAK2 V617F-mutated MPN, KIT D816V-mutated systemic mastocytosis (SM) and mast cell leukemia (MCL), and FIP1L1/PDGFRA+ chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL). It can be expected that the SFB will substantially contribute to a better understanding of molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the etiology, progression, and resistance of neoplastic cells in these MPN. Furthermore, data generated in this SFB should provide a solid basis for the development of improved diagnostic and therapeutic concepts in these neoplasms.

Its chemotherapy resistance translates into an average patient survival of <20 months. There are no approved drugs for T-PLL and numerous exploratory or comparative trials to test novel options are not feasible. First inhibitor screens, piloted by our teams, uncovered promising, but also differential sensitivities. However, we are still far from informed implementation of new molecular knowledge into clinical application. This is mostly due to lack of integration of available multi-level profiling data and a rudimentary understanding of their functional impact. Moreover, gene-regulatory, particularly epigenetic changes and metabolic cellular states, both also known to influence treatment responses in cancer, have not been addressed in T-PLL. Overall, we miss a concept of how drug activity patterns relate to T-PLL’s molecular landscape. Hypothesis: Integration of genomic, epigenetic, and phenotypic data will allow predictions of differential compound sensitivities, which in conjunction with clinical information will aid in individual treatment decisions and future trial designs. Aims / Methods: The 5 teams of ERANET-PLL will capitalize on unique prerequisites, e.g. a large repository of well-annotated material, an open registry, or T-PLL animal models. We will analyze to which degree genomic and epigenetic alterations as well as basal and inhibitor-induced metabolic signatures dictate differential substance activities. Bio-computational modelling will integrate these genotypic and phenotypic dimensions towards prediction tools of in-vitro drug sensitivities and synergies. Drug candidates will be validated in various preclinical systems. The extracted set of molecular strata will finally be interrogated in a prospective interventional study. Expected Results: Biomarkers that discern T-PLL patient subsets based on vulnerabilities towards targeted compounds.	Austrian Science Fund FWF	02 International programmes	287395.5	EUR
403	Univ.Prof. Dr. Christian STURMBAUER	University of Graz	None	2017-05-01	2020-07-31	Developmental gene evolution shaping cichlid head morphology	The remarkably species-rich assemblages of cichlid fishes in the three Great East African Lakes represent a natural “mutant model system” for the study of the factors contributing to the formation of multiple new species within short time periods. The evolutionary success of cichlid fishes was explained by their “key-innovation” of two sets of jaws, the oral and the pharyngeal jaws, allowing them to rapidly evolve diverse feeding specializations. The theory of genetic assimilation and the “Flexible Stem Hypothesis” suggest that (1) a mutation or environmental change triggers the expression of one or more novel, heritable, phenotypic variant(s) within a population; (2) the initially rare variant(s) start to spread (in the case of an environmentally induced change, due to the consistent recurrence of the environmental factor), each creating a differentiated subpopulation expressing one alternative fit variant; and (3) selection on existing genetic variation for the regulation or form of the trait under selection causes it to become genetically fixed in individuals of a subpopulation. Such subpopulations ultimately evolve to new species adapted to alternative ecological niches, at the expense of losing the ancestral phenotypic plasticity. We plan to utilize the great comparative potential of the different evolutionary ages of the radiations in the three Great East African Lakes Victoria, Malawi, and Tanganyika to tackle the validity of the Flexible Stem Hypothesis as a central mechanism of cichlid fish diversification. This concept proposes that the broad range of phenotypic plasticity of ancestral "generalist" species, which allows survival in varied environmental conditions, is progressively reduced to be replaced and expanded by genetically based, specialized phenotypes. Since trophic niche differentiation and the decoupling of oral and pharyngeal jaws in cichlids are considered a key factor facilitating rapid radiation, we will compare two outgroup riverine species with known adaptive jaw phenotypic plasticity to three monophyletic sets of eco-morphologically equivalent model species from three independent lake radiations with increasing evolutionary age. We study the genomic basis of oral and pharyngeal jaw evolution by combining geometric morphometric and genomic analyses. Thereby, we intend to find genetic and gene regulatory correlates to divergent eco-morphologies after they have been shaped during embryogenesis. We assess the scope of phenotypic plasticity for each study species in relation to the divergence time from the riverine generalists by comparing the head-morphology of corresponding wild and captivity-bred individuals via micro-computed tomography as a standardized measure to assess phenotypic plasticity. This allows us to test if the genetic architecture of eco-morphological divergence corresponds to the pattern predicted by the concept of genetic assimilation in accordance with the Flexible Stem Hypothesis. We address this at four levels: non-coding RNAs, the epigenetic regulation via CpG methylation, gene expression, and divergence in coding regions (protein evolution, gene duplications).

Prof. Dr. Gerda EGGER	Medical University of Vienna	None	2015-02-01	2018-01-31	The function of DNMT1 for NPM-ALK driven Lymphomagenesis	Aberrant DNA methylation is widely observed in tumors, which can result (i) in genomic instability due to global hypomethylation and (ii) silencing of tumor suppressor genes due to localized hypermethylation of CpG island promoters, respectively. Although the recent boost of epigenetic research has nourished our understanding of the consequences of epigenetic alterations, we still don’t know the cause of aberrant epigenetic patterning and the effects of external or cellular signals that might direct such changes. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) have important functions for cellular proliferation or differentiation, and their non-physiological activation has been implicated in various cancers. As a member of the insulin receptor superfamily of RTks the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) was discovered almost twenty years ago as an oncogenic translocation product in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). More than 20 different ALK translocation partners have been identified and aside from its role as an oncogenic driver in ALCL ALK fusion proteins were discovered in several epithelial tumors and in neuroblastoma indicating a broad relevance of ALK activity in tumorigenesis. Recent work has suggested that ALK signaling can directly impact on epigenetic alterations in tumor cells. There is evidence that the key downstream ALK mediator STAT3 can upregulate the methyltransferase DNMT1 and target methyltransferases to promoters, which induces silencing of different tumor suppressor genes. Our preliminary results demonstrate that deletion of the maintenance methyltransferase gene Dnmt1 can inhibit tumor formation in a transgenic NPM-ALK mouse model. Thus, we hypothesize that aberrant DNA methylation is critically involved in ALK dependent lymphomagenesis. Here, we aim to use a NPM-ALK transgenic mouse model to study the function of DNMT1 for tumor development and progression. We will use both a genetic and a pharmacologic approach to examine the relation between ALK signaling and aberrant DNA methylation in vivo. We intend to perform genome-wide methylation analyses to define targets of epigenetic silencing in the mouse model. We will define genome-wide STAT3 binding in NPM-ALK tumors and integrate these data with gene expression and DNA methylation patterns, to define the in vivo link between DNA methylation and ALK dependent downstream signaling. We expect that our project will provide mechanistic insights as to how oncogenic signaling can induce and target epigenetic alterations in vivo and provide a rationale for epigenetic therapy of ALK dependent malignancies. Furthermore, we expect to discover novel epigenetic drivers of lymphomagenesis, which might be essential for ALK dependent tumors in general.

The formation of polyploid plants is often connected with transcriptional gene silencing (TGS), an epigenetic change resulting in heritable, complete loss of gene expression from previously active genes, accompanied by chemical modification of the affected DNA and its associated proteins and by structural changes of the chromatin. Epigenetics in polyploids and the underlying mechanisms are interesting in the view of basic plant biology as well as for better understanding the principles of plant breeding. Based on previous observations of polyploidy-associated transcriptional gene silencing (PA-TGS) of a resistance gene in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, this proposal suggests determining which trans- and cis- acting elements are involved in this regulation. The potentially reversible inactive marker gene allows for a selection-based identification of trans-acting factors, required for maintenance of the inactive state. The search can identify new factors as well as determine the role of already known gene products. Building on loss-of-function or over-expression of the identified molecules, it will be determined which parts of the genome are susceptible to PA-TGS. Inactive and active status of the same gene in diploid and polyploid plants will be compared for their chromatin features and permit addressing the role of chromosomal location and gene structure.

With current treatment options, the majority of patients do not achieve remission or experience relapse after completion of therapy, generally with dismal outcome [1-4]. Mechanisms of progression and relapse remain elusive and predictive biomarkers do not exist, precluding clinical progress. Hypothesis We hypothesize that utilizing a unique collection of clinically annotated samples from multiple European trials and registries for detailed pathologic assessment and comprehensive characterization of the (epi-) genetic landscape will unravel pivotal mechanisms determining the unique biology and clinical behavior of PTCL. Aims Aim 1: Collect a clinically annotated, comprehensively characterized and centrally reviewed sample collection of PTCL. Aim 2: Perform a comprehensive genetic and epigenetic characterization and identify prognostic (epi-) genetic biomarkers. Aim 3: Identify molecular targets and develop novel therapeutic strategies. Methods This study will be based on biopsy samples of patients treated in prospective European clinical trials and from population-based cohorts that are collected via the national pathology reference centers. Whole exome sequencing, genome-wide DNA methylation profiling and targeted sequencing results will be correlated with clinical parameters, including progression and outcome. (Epi-) Genetic alterations will be addressed with drug screening assays in pre-clinical models and ex vivo in primary PTCL samples. Expected results & impact This study will provide a comprehensively characterized catalogue of clinically annotated samples across the major subtypes of PTCL. The integrated analysis of (epi-) genetic alterations will elucidate pathogenic mechanisms and the correlation with clinical endpoints will provide insight in prognostic biomarkers. Finally, novel therapeutic strategies will be explored on the basis of these data.	Austrian Science Fund FWF	02 International programmes	288970.5	EUR

This is mostly due to lack of integration of available multi-level profiling data and a rudimentary understanding of their functional impact. Moreover, gene-regulatory, particularly epigenetic changes and metabolic cellular states, both also known to influence treatment responses in cancer, have not been addressed in T-PLL. Overall, we miss a concept of how drug activity patterns relate to T-PLL’s molecular landscape. Hypothesis: Integration of genomic, epigenetic, and phenotypic data will allow predictions of differential compound sensitivities, which in conjunction with clinical information will aid in individual treatment decisions and future trial designs. Aims / Methods: The 5 teams of ERANET-PLL will capitalize on unique prerequisites, e.g. a large repository of well-annotated material, an open registry, or T-PLL animal models. We will analyze to which degree genomic and epigenetic alterations as well as basal and inhibitor-induced metabolic signatures dictate differential substance activities. Bio-computational modelling will integrate these genotypic and phenotypic dimensions towards prediction tools of in vitro drug sensitivities and synergies. Drug candidates will be validated in various preclinical systems. The extracted set of molecular strata will finally be interrogated in a prospective interventional study. Expected Results: Biomarkers that discern T-PLL patient subsets based on vulnerabilities towards targeted compounds.	Austrian Science Fund FWF	02 International programmes	288970.5	EUR

Background and relevance to cancer: The transatlantic prostate group has followed up a cohort of 2,333 clinically localised conservatively treated prostate cancer for over 10 years, with multiple clinical and pathological parameters, to try and determine which cases need to be selected for radical therapy. However in 60% of cases, behaviour of the tumour cannot be predicted. The cohort consisted of 55% transurethral (TURP) specimens which have been analysed for multiple biomarkers. 1039 biopsy specimens remain uncollected or analysed. Aims of research: Collection of prostatic biopsies from the series, tissue micro array (TMA) and biomarker analysis to assess candidate markers which can predict cancer behaviour. Any residual tissue will be used for RNA and epigenetic studies. Plan of research: Year 1; A pilot collection of tissue will proceed to create a TMA from the biopsy specimens. Collected cases will be examined to identify cancer. Initial immunochemistry for p63/AMACR will confirm whether the TMA tissue can be used for research and the amount of cancer in the tissue sampled. Remaining tissue from these cases will be used for later possible epigenetic studies and RNA extraction though this will not form part of the revised grant. This 'proof of principle' in the first year will show viability of both parts of the project. Year 2; Collection of remainder of tissue and TMA construction with early biomarker analysis. Year 3; Biomarker analysis, including FISH and immunochemistry with interpretation and statistical analysis. Return of blocks.	Cancer Research UK	Project Award	None	None

Cellular senescence is an important tumor suppressor mechanism. Senescent cells exhibit marked chromatin reorganization and this contributes to senescence-mediated tumor suppression. Employing in vitro cell culture, in vivo mouse models, human tissues across a spectrum of disease stages and state-of-the-art epigenomics, this programme investigates three molecular mechanisms of chromatin regulation that control senescence and its efficacy as a tumor suppression mechanism.<br/><br/>Project 1. Investigate the role of histone H4 methylation in senescence and tumor suppression. The histone methyltransferase SUV420H2 methylates histone H4 on lysine 20 to generate H4K20me3. Evidence indicates that H4K20me3 serves as a barrier to tumor progression by reinforcing cellular senescence. We will investigate the role of SUV420H2 and H4K20me3 in senescence and their impact on senescence-associated tumor suppression in vivo. <br/><br/>Project 2. Investigate CpG island DNA methylation in senescence and its impact on tumor suppression. Altered DNA methylation is a hallmark of cancer cells. Focal hypermethylation of CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes contributes to their stable silencing and consequently tumorigenesis. By whole-genome single-nucleotide bisulfite-sequencing of DNA from proliferating and senescent cells, we found that senescent cells also show increased methylation of CpG islands, including at some tumor suppressor genes that are methylated in cancer. Paradoxically, this suggests that senescent cells harbor epigenetic changes that undermine the efficacy of senescence as tumor suppressor mechanism. We will investigate the mechanism of CpG island methylation in senescence and its impact on cell senescence and tumor suppression. <br/><br/>Project 3. Investigate control of retrotransposons in senescent cells. The human genome harbors L1 retrotransposons that can insert de novo elsewhere in the genome. These disruptive insertions are thought to promote cancer. In cancer cells, global DNA hypomethylation is thought to promote activation of retrotransposons. As well as focal hypermethylation of CpG islands, senescent cells, like cancer cells, also exhibit global DNA hypomethylation. This is expected to promote activity of retrotransposons. We will investigate two mechanisms, interferon signaling and the HUCA histone chaperone, whose activation in senescence is proposed to counter activation of oncogenic retrotransposons. <br/><br/>There is currently considerable excitement over chromatin as a target zone for cancer drug and biomarker discovery. Completion of these objectives can lead to advances in early detection and intervention to combat this disease.	Cancer Research UK	Renewing Programme Award	None	None

Chronic inflammation has emerged as a potent stimulus for aberrant DNA methylation in a number of tissues and disease states. I aim to investigate whether there is an association between inflammatory activity and aberrant DNA methylation in sporadic colonic adenomatous polyps. The hypothesis-forming step will involve array-based methylation analysis to assess for differentially methylated genes in prospectively collected, matched polyp and normal mucosal samples using microarray technology. Hypothesis-testing and validation will be achieved by inflammatory phenotyping of an archival polyp set using established immunohistochemical techniques, combined with targeted methylation analysis using methylation-specific PCR. To address the mechanistic aspects by which chronic inflammation might promote aberrant DNA methylation, the same array-based technology will be used to assess changes in promoter methylation in a human adenoma cell line under conditions of oxidative stress. As a collaborative project, I plan to investigate the potential role that senescent cells might play in contributing to the inflammatory milieu within polyps. Immunohistochemical staining for senescent cell markers will be employed on the same archival polyp set to determine the quantity and topographic distribution of senescent cells within polyps. In order to investigate whether secreted factors from senescent cells can modify adenoma cell behaviour, we aim to perform in vitro co-culturing experiments and in vivo tumorigenesis studies using the adenoma cell line in combination with either senescent or pre-senescent human fibroblasts.

The program of research focuses on: 1) modelling gene regulatory networks across multiple tissues; 2) integrated multi-phenotype and linkage analyses of cardiovascular and metabolic traits, and 3) extension of these approaches to incorporate human Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) data, expression QTL (eQTL) and next-generation sequencing data. In particular, the methodologies and tools will be employed to reconstruct pathways and network models using reverse engineering approaches to predict the consequences of genetic and genomic variants on clinically relevant whole-body phenotypes. The generality of this modelling approach makes it adaptable to several model systems (rats, humans) with broad application to multiple phenotype analyses, including transcriptional and epigenetic profiles, or genetically complex cardiovascular traits. Through the implementation of powerful analytical strategies to highly dimensional datasets, we will enable integrative genomics approaches to uncover complex regulatory mechanisms underlying cardiovascular and metabolic traits.||Specific Objectives:||To build transcriptional networks using graphical models and integrate these with phenotypic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabonomic data using high-throughput next generation sequencing data in rats and humans.|To extend predictive Bayesian models for multi-phenotype mapping in humans, integrating GWAS and eQTL data.|To evaluate the relevance of disease regulatory networks across multiple species, integrating relevant human data (gene expression, GWAS) to discriminate between alternative models of regulatory control of patho-physiological phenotypes.

Except for sorafenib, which prolongs survival in patients with advanced HCC for 2-3 months, no effective systemic therapy exists for these patients. However, sorafenib is not approved by NICE in the UK. HCC almost never occurs in a background of a healthy liver, and there is a growing understanding regarding the molecular mechanisms that induce and maintain hepatocarcinogenesis,. Along with alchohol induced liver disease, chronic Hepatitis C and B virus (HCV and HBV) infections are major risk factors for the development of HCC, and the cancer risk increases sharply in response to chronic injury at the cirrhosis stage. Activated liver macrophages are intrinsically involved in the different types of hepatic injury, including hepatitis and the ensuing hepatobiliary fibrogenesis. The Esterase Sensitive Motif (ESM) technology allows the targeted accumulation of molecules in cells of the myeloid lineage which express the human carboxylesterase-1 protein (hCE-1). This includes monocytes, macrophages and further differentiated macrophages such as Kupffer cells. CHR-2845 and its active metabolite CHR-2847 are both histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) and are examples of the application of the ESM technology. The active metabolite CHR-2847 has been engineered to specifically accumulate in cells of the monocyte lineage which include tumour associated macrophages, the presence of increased numbers of which predicts poor prognosis in patients with HCC (Ding et al, 2009). Being able to specifically target monocytes and macrophages, which are key mediators in the inflammatory disease process, should enable effective targeting of a major cause of ongoing inflammation in the diseased liver and hence allow increased disease control. Besides macrophages and Kupffer cells, CHR-2847 may also accumulate in hepatocytes, and tumour cells that are derived from hepatocytes. As HDAC inhibitors normally only affect transformed cells, it is expected that there will be greater epigenetic changes induced in the transformed- compared to the non-transformed hepatocytes. Regulation of the acetylation of both histone and non-histone proteins by histone deacetylase enzymes is one of the key mechanisms involved in epigenetic control of gene expression. HDACi have demonstrated activity in both in vitro cytotoxicity, and in vivo tumour xenograft studies (Beckers et al, 2007; Hess-Stumpp et al, 2007; Qian et al, 2006; Qian et al, 2007). In addition, HDACi have been successful in the clinic (Tan et al 2010)	Cancer Research UK	New Agents Committee - Trial Grant Application	None	None

Compelling evidence from our group and others demonstrates that failure to up-regulate cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression plays important roles in the pathogenesis of SSc and other lung fibroses. Our recent data demonstrates that methyltransferase inhibitors restore the responsiveness of SSc lung fibroblasts to inducers of COX-2, and normalisation of cell functions including prostaglandin E2 production and sensitivity to apoptosis. However, this does not associate with changes in COX-2 CpG methylation suggesting an indirect mechanism of methyltransferase inhibition. Additional preliminary data shows increased levels of DNA methyltransferases 1, 3a and 3b in SSc lung and DNA methyltransferase activity in SSc lung fibroblasts compared with controls, as well as, increased repressive methylhistone marks, including histone H3K9me2, both of which could be affected by methyltransferase inhibition. This indicates that DNA and/or histone methylation may play roles in limiting COX-2 expression. We therefore aim to determine the mechanism/s by which methyltransferase inhibitors restore SSc lung fibroblast expression of COX-2 and cell function. More specifically, we will: (i) determine whether repressive histone methylation marks are associated with the limited capacity of SSc lung fibroblasts to express COX-2. Repressive methylhistone marks will be systematically investigated and those that are increased in SSc compared with controls and reduced by methyltransferase inhibitors will be assessed by ChIP-quantitative RT-PCR to determine their association with COX-2 expression; (ii) Identify and investigate the role of novel methylated genes in the regulation of fibroblast COX-2 expression. Genes that are hypermethylated in SSc lung fibroblasts and in which methylation is reduced by methyltransferase inhibitors will be identified using methylation arrays followed by characterisation of their ability to regulate COX-2 expression; (iii) elucidate changes in miRNA expression in SSc lung fibroblasts and investigate their role in the deregulation of COX-2 expression. Using expression arrays, miRNAs that exhibit low expression in SSc lung fibroblasts compared with controls and which increase following treatment with methyltransferase inhibitors will be identified and their role in regulating COX-2 expression determined using expression plasmids and siRNA. Such studies will provide fundamental information on the regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 expression in SSc and, if successful, provide a strong rationale for clinical trials of methyltransferase inhibitors, currently used in other clinical conditions, in SSc. In addition, the methylation and miRNA profiling studies will likely identify novel targets for the investigation and potential treatment of SSc.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	283621.0	GBP

Mechanisms of cellular senescence Cellular senescence is a state of stable cell cycle arrest with active metabolism. Similar to apoptosis, senescence can be a failsafe program against a variety of cellular insults. In contrast to apoptosis, in which cytotoxic signals converge to a common mechanism, senescence is typically a delayed stress response involving multiple effector mechanisms. These effector mechanisms include epigenetic regulation, the DNA damage response, and the senescence-associated secretion phenotype. The relative contribution of these effectors varies depending on the trigger and cell type, and it is possible that the combination and balance of these effectors determines the quality of the senescence phenotype. Thus, to understand the senescence program, it is important to identify new effector mechanisms and examine how they associate with each other, and also to identify which effector mechanisms could be potential targets for cancer therapy. Identification of senescence-associated chromatin factors To further understand the molecular basis underlying the irreversibility of senescence arrest, we have been using a biochemical approach to analyse the alteration of the cell's chromatin protein profile during senescence. Using SDS-PAGE to visualize the protein composition of each chromatin preparation, we have identified HMGA proteins as new components of senescence (Narita et al., Cell 2006; 126: 503). Considering the identification of HMGA proteins in this system as a proof of concept, we are currently taking a more systematic approach for a thorough analysis of the chromatin protein profile in senescent cells. So far, we have several candidate proteins that specifically associate with chromatin to form senescent cells. Now we are in the process of verifying and analysing them in the context of senescence. Genome-wide analysis of heterochromatin components in SAHFs Certain types of cells undergo distinct alterations in chromatin structure during senescence, called senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF). SAHF have been widely used as a marker of senescence, and more importantly, several new components of senescence machinery have been successfully identified using SAHF as a readout. Thus, it is important to understand SAHF structure in more detail and how SAHF are actually formed. Interestingly, we have shown that SAHF are indistinguishable from the inactive X (Xi) chromosome, one of the best studied heterochromatin models, and other groups recently suggested that each individual SAHF might represent each chromosome territory. In contrast to Xi, SAHF formation can be dynamically regulated in normal human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs), thus providing a unique tool to study not only senescence, but also chromatin biology. To further characterise SAHF in detail, we are currently investigating a dynamic redistribution of the specific histone modifications and their adaptor proteins using confocal microscopy, with a new panel of highly specific monoclonal antibodies against histone marks (in collaboration with Dr. Hiroshi Kimura, Osaka University, Japan). In addition, we are currently analysing the genome-wide redistribution of these chromatin components by chromatin-IP coupled with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq). From mRNA to proteins Oncogene induced senescence (OIS) is a very dynamic process where cells typically undergo an initial burst of cell proliferation ('mitotic phase'), followed by the induction of pro-senescent factors, including p16 and HMGA2 ('transition phase'). Eventually, the senescent phenotype dominates ('senescence phase'). During the transition phase, oncogenic and pro?senescence activities work against each other, and senescence usually prevails in normal cells. How cells can achieve such a drastic phenotype remodelling is unclear. A new area of interest in my group is in another layer of gene expression control, namely protein metabolism, during the senescence and transition phases. We reason that global epigenetic alteration should be coupled with efficient protein turnover as a part of the execution of epigenetic 'blue prints', in such an emergent context. Consistent with this idea, we have identified that autophagy, a bulk protein degradation program, facilitates synthesis of IL6/8, which are pro-senescence secretory proteins (Young et al., Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 798). This new functional link between senescence and autophagy will be further characterised in the future. Identification of senescence-associated p53 function A tumour suppressive transcription factor,p53, plays a critical role in many stress responsive phenotypes, including DNA damage checkpoints, apoptosis, and senescence. Although ample data have supported a role for p53 in senescence, the precise mechanism is not clear. To address this issue, we are currently using HDFs, where we can induce different phenotypes depending on environmental stimuli or other conditions . By adding either retroviral- or lentiviral-mediated stable RNAi to HDFs, we are comparing the impact of p53 knockdown on the gene expression profile in each condition, which represents a phenotypespecific p53 function. We have finished the array experiments, and are now attempting to build a comprehensive picture of p53's functions. So far, in a primary analysis, we have identified several genes whose products are upregulated in a p53-dependent manner during senescence, but not in the other stress responsive contexts (e.g. apoptosis). We are currently undertaking functional verification of one of the genes.	Cancer Research UK	Senior Institute Group Leader	None	None
415	Prof. Dr. Wilfried ELLMEIER	Medical University of Vienna	None	2014-02-01	2017-12-31	The role of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in CD4+ T cells	Reversible changes in histone acetylation patterns play a key role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. We previously showed that histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1 is a key regulator of Th2 cytokine responses. Interestingly, late T cell development in the absence of HDAC1 (using Cd4Cre) was not impaired. However, HDAC2 was up-regulated in the absence of HDAC1, thus we hypothesized compensatory functions between HDAC1 and HDAC2 in T cells. Indeed, by generating mice with a T cell-specific loss (Cd4Cre) of both HDAC1 and HDAC2, we obtained preliminary data showing that HDAC1/2 are essential to maintain CD4 lineage integrity by repressing a CD8 lineage effector program in CD4+ T cells. Based on these results, we propose to study how HDAC1/HDAC2 regulate T helper lineage integrity and function. Further, to fully understand how HDAC1/2 regulate CD4 lineage integrity, we will investigate on a genome-wide level the impact of HDAC1 and HDAC2 on the chromatin landscape and the transcriptional program in CD4+ T cells. Our study will provide important insight into fundamental aspects of how CD4 lineage integrity is maintained, into the immunoregulatory roles of HDAC1 and HDAC2, and into how T cell-mediated immune responses are linked with epigenetic gene regulatory networks.

Positional information is then translated into specific gene expression profiles by the interaction of proteins with DNA. Such interaction includes the regulation of chromatin conformation to establish and maintain a specific repertoire of active and inactive genes in a particular cell type. In plants, the vascular tissue is the main system mediating transport over long distances and also determines the mechanical properties of the plant body. Due to the highly diverse cell repertoire and the close interaction with surrounding tissues, plant vascular tissue represents an attractive target for analysing cell specification and patterning in complex organisms. Remarkably, despite their interesting diversity and their importance for plant development and physiology, knowledge of the molecular processes which control the establishment and maintenance of vascular cell types and their physiological properties is still very fragmentary. In this proposal we, therefore, suggest isolating and characterising new developmental regulators involved in the determination of vascular cell identity and addressing the contribution of chromatin regulation to the tissue-specific activity of two characterised regulators. This will be achieved by performing a mutagenesis screen and by analysing tissue-specific chromatin properties. The outcomes of the proposed experiments will result in a more detailed view of the whole body organisation of plants by addressing the question of how their essential transport system is established and how its specific pattern is generated. The elucidation of such molecular mechanisms will also have implications for the understanding of developmental processes in other organisms, in particular, due to our combination of a more classical developmental question with emerging concepts of epigenetic gene regulation. Beyond scientific aspects, the understanding of the molecular control of vascular development also has implications for various aspects of crop production as it will facilitate the modulation of vascular properties by genetic and transgenic approaches.

While cell type specific transcription factors are one aspect behind this diversity in gene expression, the “epigenetic” identity of each cell type presents a more basic form of information according to which individual transcriptional programs are being executed. The last decade has brought significant progress in understanding the biochemical mechanisms which are associated with epigenetic gene regulation, yet very little is known about how external signals, which are essential for cell fate decisions, orchestrate the genome-wide changes in chromatin configuration which result in heritable changes of gene expression. Understanding how receptor signaling establishes a cell type defining “epigenome” presents a major challenge for the next decade in the field of chromatin research. The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is a critical regulator of skin homeostasis and differentiation. Importantly, EGFR signaling prevents the premature differentiation of epidermal cells in the skin, a phenomenon which can be recapitulated in vitro by culturing EGFR-deficient keratinocytes. Recently, epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation have been demonstrated to regulate epidermal differentiation, similar to EGFR function. One of the questions we will address in this proposal is, therefore, if and how EGFR signaling regulates epigenetic mechanisms controlling the cellular identity of epithelial cells during (epidermal) stem cell self-renewal, differentiation and tissue homeostasis. We will address this by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by genome wide sequencing in order to generate “epigenomic” maps of normal and EGFR-deficient epidermal cells, thus visualizing EGFR’s impact on chromatin signatures associated with epidermal stem cell homeostasis. In addition, we will analyze the differentiation defect of EGFR-deficient cells in detail, focusing on a link between EGFR function, Dnmt1 expression and DNA methylation.

The nucleus is by no means a random mixture of DNA and proteins but rather a highly ordered and compartimentalized entity. Chromosomes, for an instance, assume preferred positions within the nucleus and their non-random distribution in interphase is heritable over cell divisions. In general it is believed that gene rich chromosomes preferrably localise in the interior of the nucleus whereas gene poor chromosomes localizes at the periphery. This points at a correlation between radial postioning of loci and their expression state. Indeed, loci like the immunoglobulin cluster or the beta-globin locus migrate away from the nuclear periphery upon activation and assume central postions when their full activity can be observed. The gross re-localisation of entire genes however is not the ultimate means by which active and inactive sequences can be physically seperated. Recently it was shown that upon activation individual genes of a multigene cluster - the HoxB cluster - loop out of their chromosome territory and fold back towards it when they are not being transcribed any longer. This looping out of the solid and inaccessible bluk chromosome territory into the so called interchromatin compartment is believed to facilitate transcription factor accessibility which can change the transcriptional state of this particular gene and lead to the epigenetic reprogramming of this locus. Proteins mediating such higher order chromatin reorganisations and subnuclear movements are still largely unknown. The SatB2 protein was identified as a protein binding to the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer. Its close relative SatB1 is known to regulate T cell specific gene expression by modulating long range chromatin interactions, loop formation and epigenetic landscaping of its target genes. Loss of function experiments have revealed that SatB2 deficient mice have severe skelletal defects and that SatB2 deficient osteoblasts show deregulated Hox gene expression. In addition, SatB2 binds to the HoxB cluster and directly represses its expression. Given the close molecular relationship between SatB2 and SatB1, we consider SatB2 a candidate regulator of the HoxB multigene cluster. We are using both osteoblastic cells as well as ES cells to analyse SatB2's role in the regulation of the HoxB cluster. ES cells have the tremendous advantage that upon differentiation they activate the HoxB cluster in a co-linear manner. Using this system it was shown that the activity of HoxB genes correlates with their subnuclear localisation. Using these two cell types we will address the mechanisms by which SatB2 regulated the HoxB cluster. We are mainly interested in the effect of SatB2 on the subnuclear localisation of the HoxB cluster as well as on the accompanying changes in the chromatin configuration of this locus.

However, an age-related reduction in crypt number and crypt cell proliferation, and an impaired ability of the epithelium to recover from injury, have all been observed in rodents. The canonical Wnt signalling pathway is the master regulator of intestinal epithelial renewal. Constitutive activation of Wnt signals disrupts intestinal tissue homeostasis in epithelial neoplasia, but preliminary evidence indicates that it also occurs with age in the apparently normal gut. Our pilot studies show that the activity of Wnt signals, and the degree of CpG island methylation of Wnt inhibitor genes, an epigenetic mechanism for gene silencing, both increase with age and vary markedly from crypt-to-crypt in the same individual. We propose that the development of increased Wnt signals along the crypt-axis reflects this age- dependent methylation of Wnt inhibitor genes. To test this hypothesis and understand the consequences for tissue homeostasis we will apply bioimaging and functional genomic approaches to a unique native human colonic crypt culture system. We will measure levels of CpG island methylation of Wnt inhibitor genes, and Wnt signals, in single crypts derived from human volunteers of widely differing age. Age- related variations in levels of DNA methyltransferase activity, and their responses to imposed molecular and cellular stress, will be quantified. We will use RNAi techniques to silence Wnt inhibitors and study the functional consequences for tissue renewal. Finally, we will build a database that can be interrogated with multivariate statistics to derive and test mechanistic hypotheses on the relationship between loss of epithelial tissue homeostasis and levels of CpG island methylation in a panel of Wnt inhibitor genes.

Although mortality rates have not improved dramatically during the last 30 years, it has been well demonstrated that prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy in high risk women with familial predisposition, is a cost-effective procedure to dramatically reduce the risk of ovarian and fallopian tube cancer. However, only 10% of ovarian cancers are attributable to familial predisposition so there is a need for markers of predisposition to ovarian cancer independent of family history to guide preventative strategies in the 90% of ovarian cancers which are sporadic. The ideal markers would be DNA based surrogates for genetic, transgenerational, developmental and environmental events which subsequently lead to cancer. Employing 5-methylcytosine methylation - a covalent modification of cytosine at CpG dinucleotides which is likely to meet these criteria - there is good evidence for an early stem cell origin of cancer. Embryonic stem (ES) cells rely on Polycomb group (PcG) proteins to reversibly repress genes required for differentiation. These PcG targets were shown to be much more likely to reveal cancer-specific promoter DNA hypermethylation in cancer than genes not targeted by Polycomb repressive complexes (PRC) in ES cells. These changes were also identified at a low level in normal adjacent tissue and in haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. So it seems to be proven that cancer arises from wayward stem cells in which DNA methylation mediated permanent silencing of specific genes has locked the cell into a perpetual state of self-renewal and rendering it susceptible to malignant transformation by further genetic and epigenetic events. To identify changes associated with a risk of ovarian cancer, we will analyze these epigenetic stem cell markers in peripheral white blood cells. Within a training set, 240 different DNA methylation based stem cell markers will be tested. Based on ROC statistics and logistic regression a model consisting of specific markers will be created and tested in an independent set of cases and controls. The samples for these studies will be obtained from unique sample banks at the Institute of Women's Health (UCL). Results gained within this study may form the basis for a novel, non-invasive strategy for risk assessment (DNA methylation in WBCs) of ovarian cancer.

Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. A proportion of these cancers are caused by human papilloma virus and patients being diagnosed with this subtype have a significantly better outcome. The reasons and underlying mechanisms for this are not fully understood. The aim of this project is to carry out comprehensive methylome and microRNA analysis and validation of HPV-associated HNSCC samples. Furthermore, both HPV infected and non-HPV infected cell lines will be studied to obtain microRNA-mRNA interaction maps. These multidimensional data will be integrated and linked to publicly available gene expression data of HPV positive and HPV negative head and neck cancer to identify pathways dysregulated by HPV infection. Determination of the molecular changes occurring specific to viral infection will significantly increase our understanding of virus-induced tumourigenesis and of head and neck carcinogenesis in particular. This will guide the i dentification of molecular markers for risk prediction and early diagnosis. Moreover, the reversible nature of epigenetic aberrations has led to the emergence of the promising field of epigenetic therapy and our understanding of these changes may lead to the development of novel therapeutic targets for this specific subtype of cancer.

Onset and progression of spontaneous drug-resistant seizure activity remains, however, difficult to predict and determine in affected patients, irrespective of their epileptogenic condition, i.e., traumatic brain injury, temporal lobe (hippocampal) sclerosis or genetic inheritance. The objective of this CRP is to characterize common epigenetic pathomechanisms of epileptogenesis and, thereby, to identify novel targets for pharmacotherapy. Animal models and investigations of human specimens have shown alterations in the expression patterns of a variety of genes, including neuropeptides. This altered expression pattern of specific neuropeptides is characterized by rapid onset and can be long lasting. For some of these changes an endogenous anticonvulsive role has been suggested. The underlying mechanisms regulating altered expression of peptides in epilepsy are yet not understood. Recent evidence has identified chromatin remodeling at gene promoter regions as a key control mechanism of gene expression and may, therefore, partly mediate acute and chronic effects of epileptic seizures on gene activity. In particular methylation of DNA and modifications of histones, including acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation are identified modifications resulting in altered gene transcription. The project part will use an animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy and tissue from temporal lobe epilepsy patients to investigate such epigenetic mechanisms involved in the expression of the neuropeptides dynorphin, neuropeptide Y and neurokinin B. We will investigate the expression patterns of epigenetically acting key enzymes, including histone deacetylases and DNA methyl-transferases in animal models of epileptic seizures compared to specimens from TLE patients. In particular altered DNA methylation and histone acetylation of promoter regions of neuropeptides (neuropeptide Y, dynorphin, neurokinin B) will be investigated. Moreover the hypothesis will be tested that inhibition and/or over-expression of identified enzymes by infusion of respective viral vectors will significantly modify expression patterns of neuropeptides and epileptic seizure activity, ultimately leading to the identification of novel drug targets.

Immediately following a polyploidization event, a genome generally suffers adjustments in organization and function at the genetic and epigenetic level. These alterations have the potential to induce novel expression patterns, which together with permanent heterozygosity and gene redundancy, might result in significant phenotypic shifts and elevated evolutionary flexibility. Many “key” genes present in the extant angiosperm genomes are believed to have originated as a result of ancient polyploidizations. Now it is recognized that multiple origins are the rule for most allopolyploids, but the long term evolutionary significance of recurrent allopolyploid formation is unclear. Recurrent polyploidy can result in substantially different lineages, and it is interesting how such species can maintain distinctiveness while sharing the same genetic heritage and ploidy level. Here we aim to screen genome-wide natural diversity in gene expression rates among sibling species in order to identify genes that may drive adaptation to different environments and lead to isolation. By taking advantage of the most recent advances in genomic technologies such as high-throughput sequencing provided by Roche Titanium FLX and Illumina GA platforms, we will test the theoretical predictions that only a few genetic loci controlling key traits are necessary for rapid ecological diversification. We will use a sophisticated model system, represented by ecologically divergent but related species of Dactylorhiza in their native environmental context. In the “short” evolutionary terms relevant for our model system (most probably formed at or after the last glaciation), the differences in phenotypes are expected to be mainly due to divergent regulatory networks (rates of expression) rather than to physical differences in the coding region of the genome. Using the FLX platform we will sequence one reference transcriptome, on which we will map millions of short tags quantitatively sequenced for several individuals with Illumina in a SAGE-like digital transcriptomics approach. Further, we will look for quantitative patterns correlated with native environmental parameters, as well as loci showing greater between-species expression difference relative to within-species variation. These loci will be further analysed and their variation characterized. The approach proposed here is innovative and particularly opportune as it may help to better understand the extent and ways in which rapidly changing environments trigger alterations in gene expression and create novel adaptation. The project will provide one of the most comprehensive studies of natural variation within an allopolyploid group and will lead to an enhanced appreciation of the effects of polyploidy on the evolution of metabolic pathways that are significant to adaptation and speciation. Finally, it has the potential to provide a drastically new perspective on the links between polyploidy and functional diversity and it will contribute toward a better understanding and hence prediction of the spectrum of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms active at the intraspecific (population) level.

Previous studies have shown that long heterochromatic regions of the genome, so called lamina-associated domains (LADs) are tethered to the nuclear envelope, thereby contributing to stable repression of genes within LADs. However, several differentiation-specific genes that are located outside of constitutive LADs also move away from or towards the nuclear envelope upon their activation and repression, respectively, but the molecular players and mechanisms involved are ill defined. In this project we will generate a novel “gene track” myoblast cell system by tagging the endogenous MyoD and Pax7 genes with lacO repeats using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, which will allow us to monitor movement of these genes from and to the nuclear envelope during myoblast in vitro differentiation. Using this “gene track” system we will identify differentiation-specific gene tethers at the nuclear envelope by systematically knocking out (using CRISPR/Cas9) a total of 31 different nuclear envelope transmembrane proteins (NETs), which were previously shown to be involved in tethering chromatin to the nuclear envelope and/or were found to be expressed specifically in muscle. We will identify NETs, whose knockout affects translocation of MyoD and Pax7, in a semi-automated microscopic screen and will test, how these NETs and the NET-mediated “gene tethering” is regulated during differentiation. Mechanisms to be tested include potential changes in the expression, localization and modification of relevant NETs during differentiation and/or epigenetic profile changes in the moving genes. Epigenetic changes in the gene loci will be addressed by chromatin immunopreciptation (ChIP) using antibodies to various active and respressive histone marks. Moreover, we will target the respective epigenetic modifier enzymes to the gene loci using lacI-enzyme fusions to test whether particular modifications are sufficient to initiate gene movements. We will also investigate association of identified NETs with genes on a genome-wide level by ChIP-deep sequencing and test whether specific sequence elements in or around the translocated gene loci are involved in tethering. Finally we will address whether lamins in the nuclear interior together with their binding partner lamina-associated polypeptide (LAP)2alpha are involved in differentiation-dependent gene translocation. These nucleoplasmic lamin complexes have recently been shown to bind open chromatin between heterochromatic LADs (including MyoD and Pax7 loci) and to affect epigenetic pathways. We will use LAP2alpha knockout myoblasts to study its involvement in gene relocalization and employ lacI-LAP2alpha fusions in the gene track myoblast line to test for direct effects on gene relocalization. Overall this study will provide novel insight into the enigma of regulated nuclear envelope tethering of specific genes during differentiation and will test the potential involvement of nucleoplasmic lamin complexes.

427	Prof. Dr. Nadia STEFANOVA	Medical University of Innsbruck	None	2015-03-15	2019-03-14	Alpha-synuclein - a pathogenic trigger and interventional target in multiple system atrophy	Chronic diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) cause great suffering to afflicted individuals and a large burden on society. Depression, anxiety disorders, migraine and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), occur with high and increasing prevalence but despite treatment improvements, their management is still unsatisfactory. As the molecular disease mechanisms are not fully understood, current drug therapies are mainly symptomatic and often cause side effects. An evident need towards advanced treatment options is to identify signaling pathways suitable for novel therapeutic strategies. Aim of this research network is to exploit our research experience with different well-validated disease models (PD, AD, Multiple System Atrophy, fear and anxiety disorders, depression) and selected patient cohorts and combine them with local basic research strengths to comprehensively study two signaling pathways that bear high potential for innovative therapeutic intervention: L-type Ca2+ channels (LTCCs) and epigenetic modulators, in particular histone deacetylases (HDACs). This was motivated by the fact that both pathways appear to participate in the etiology of several of these disorders, as well as by recent preliminary findings from our consortium suggesting that both signaling pathways can be (patho)physiologically linked to each other. Based on existing collaborations between network partners, we now systematically study the role of different LTCC isoforms in the etiology of PD, parkinsonism associated with Multiple System Atrophy, and AD. Our translational approach will range from the molecular level to in vivo studies, including electrophysiological investigations of the biophysical and pharmacological properties of different LTCC isoforms, their role in functional signaling networks in dopaminergic neurons in vital slices and in vivo studies in animal disease models to assess their potential significance as neuroprotective drug targets. For these and other CNS diseases we will also investigate the etiological role of epigenetic and, based on local expertise, non-coding RNA (ncRNA)-mediated mechanisms from various perspectives. This will involve identification of disease-relevant ncRNAs, biochemical properties of HDAC complexes in healthy and diseased brains and studying possible direct links between Ca2+ channel signaling and histone-modifying mechanisms. For example, we will study molecular mechanisms underlying disturbed fear memory regulation, in which both, LTCCs and epigenetic mechanism seem to be involved. This will include investigating the role of HDACs in studies with novel isoform-selective inhibitors. As both LTCC and HDAC signaling also affects neurogenesis, the molecular basis for this modulation will also be investigated in normal and diseased brain. Moreover, our efforts will also involve efforts to develop LTCC blockers with preferential CNS targeting as well as novel compounds interfering with isoform-selective HDAC activity or, as a novel concept, with protein binding to methylated DNA. Furthermore clinical investigations in our patient cohorts with Multiple System Atrophy and certain Ca2+ channel diseases (e.g. Familial Hemiplegic Migraine type 1) will be merged with insights from appropriate animal disease models to provide a translational strategy for developing disease biomarkers for progression and disease severity of these CNS disorders.

The aim of the SeedAdapt project is to elucidate molecular mechanisms of fruit, seed and seedling traits that evolved in annual plant species as adaptations to changing and unpredictable environments. Although these traits are cornerstones for food quality and safety as well as for the fate of ecosystems, the molecular and developmental biodiversity of mechanisms underlying the adaptation to abiotic stresses including heat and drought are only poorly understood. To provide novel insight into this important adaptation mechanism, our interdisciplinary and integrative project utilizes the distinct 'dimorphic diaspore syndromes' (DDS) that develop on the same plant of annual Aethionema species (Brassicaceae) as dormancy bet-hedging strategy. The 'Seed-Diaspore Syndrome (SDS)' resembles the 'default pathway' of weeds like Arabidopsis: dehiscent fruits disperse seeds with non-deep dormancy, these seeds form mucilage upon imbibition, and embryos emerge with radicles first during germination. The 'Fruit-Diaspore Syndrome (FDS)' constitutes a 'novel pathway': indehiscent fruits are dispersed that contain non-mucilaginous seeds with deep dormancy, and embryos emerge with cotyledons first during germination. We will compare SDS and FDS of two Aethionema arabicum accessions adapted to distinct climates, for their responses to abiotic stress during three sensitive processes: (1) reproduction, (2) germination, (3) seedling growth. For the dimorphic diaspore formation we will investigate the SDS/FDS-ratios depending on the parental environment, perform an evolutionary comparison of dispersal genes, and study syndrome- and stress-related glucosinolate patterns (diaspore herbivory). The dimorphic diaspores' hormonomes, epigenomes, and transcriptomes provide a 'syndrome x stress memory' which will be quantified in a comparative manner and integrated with stress physiology modeling, seed biomechanics, and growth imaging of dimorphic seedlings. The genome sequence and an RNA-Seq bioinformatics pipeline for Ae. arabicum are available. The comparison of the 'syndrome x stress memory' data will provide differentially expressed genes and distinct epigenetic markers. Their targeted analyses will be extended across several Aethionema populations/species, as well as by phylogenomics (e.g. promoter elements) and cross-species reverse-genetics in crops and models. We will conduct forward and reverse genetics of SDS and FDS to separate individual traits, including EMS-mutant screens and QTL analyses using already existing RILs, and we will establish genetic transformation and resources. We propose that investigating the regulatory basis of fruit, seed, and seedling trait diversity is ideal for integrating new technologies and complementary expertise in order to study a field with utmost importance in ecology, evolution, seed industry and crop breeding.

The most extensively investigated modification is acetylation, catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases.Our laboratory has recently reported a novel level of regulation of histone deacetylases in maize, namely that the histone deacetylase activity of an ZmHda1 homolog is regulated by limited proteolysis (Pipal et al., 2003). ZmHDA1 is synthesized as an enzymatically inactive protein with an apparent MW of 84,000 which is converted to an enzymatically active 48 kD HDAC by proteolytic removal of the C-terminal part, presumably by the aid of a 65 kD intermediate protein. The enzymatically inactive 84 kD precursor protein is part of a 300 kD complex of unknown composition and function. Only the processed 48 kD protein as a monomer had deacetylase activity and was able to repress transcription efficiently in a reporter gene assay; deacetylase activity of the 48 kD protein was dependent on phosphorylation. Interestingly, Arabidopsis not only contains an Hda1 homologous gene, but also a distinct gene encoding a small protein of 252 amino acids; this small protein is highly related to the C-terminal proteolytic cleavage product of ZmHDA1. The function of this protein is unknown. The regulation of maize HDA1 by limited proteolysis is likely to represent a unique, plant specific level of HDAC regulation, connecting chromatin acetylation and protolytic pathways. Based on these findings the project proposal addresses this novel interconnection by characterization, purification and identification of ZmHDA1 forms and associated complexes. In particular it will focus on: -the purification and identification of proteins associated with ZmHda1-p84 in high molecular weight complexes, -the purification and identification of the protease responsible for conversion of enzymatically inactive ZmHda1-p84 into enzymatically active ZmHda1-p48, -the characterization of the proteolytic cleavage product (p36) and its complex, -the modifications of ZmHDA1-p84, p48 and p36, and -the localization of the relevant proteins and protein complexes in different maize tissues.

Prof Philipp Bernhard STABER	Medical University of Vienna	None	2009-01-01	2009-12-31	Role of Noncoding RNAs Emerging from PU.1 Gene Locus	PU.1 levels are critical for normal hematopoiesis and, even modest alterations can lead to leukemias and lymphomas. To achieve optimal expression of the PU.1 gene at different stages of hematopoiesis, multiple interactions are required between its regulatory elements to form fine chromatin architecture. Preliminary studies have demonstrated a novel mechanism of gene regulation through coordinated expression of the target gene and its regulatory natural noncoding transcripts. While significant advances have been made in understanding which PU.1 locus chromatin states are active or silent, nothing is known how these states are propagated and maintained. In this study I aim to investigate mechanisms of noncoding RNA involvement in formation of alterant chromatin states and shed light on the interplay between well established epigenetic marks (such as nucleosome positioning, histone modification, and DNA methylation) and the emerging class of new epigenetic marks: noncoding RNAs. Therefore I will investigate the functional effect of noncoding RNAs ablation on the formation of the active chromatin configuration and the expression of the PU.1 gene and, ultimately, on hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) fate. Accomplishment of these aims will enable us to understand the roles of noncoding RNAs corresponding to the PU.1 gene locus in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and to identify naturally occurring RNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms, the manipulation of which might lead to critical changes in cell fate and provide knowledge of how changes in noncoding RNAs can lead to disorders of hematopoietic stem cell function and leukemia.

Senescent cells are characterized by a viable growth arrest and an altered expression profile that are suggested to affect integrity and function of tissues thus contributing to organismal aging and age-related pathologies. The finding that telomere-adjacent genes are usually repressed and can be activated by epigenetic remodeling of the chromatin upon telomere shortening (telomere position effect, TPE) has lead to the intriguing notion that telomere length itself might regulate the onset of changes associated with aging. In the human system, TPE so far has only been studied in tumor cell lines with reporter genes adjacent to artificially seeded telomeres lacking subtelomeric regions. Therefore, the objective of this project is to investigate TPE in a more natural system, in normal human cells. Following specific aims will be pursued: First, it will be verified that TPE actually exists in normal human diploid cells, using a reporter system. Second, endogenous genes regulated by TPE will be identified in several normal human cell strains with a microarray containing the most telomeric candidate genes of all human chromosomes. Third, a screen for factors required for establishment and maintenance of TPE will be performed in a human tumor cell line harboring a telomere-adjacent reporter construct using an shRNA library. The identified genes will then be tested in normal diploid human cells, both with regard to a reporter construct and to endogenous genes regulated by TPE. Further investigation will strongly depend on the specific factors identified in aim 2 and 3. All together, the results of this project will help to elucidate the mechanisms leading to the dysfunctional phenotype of aged cells, which is indispensable for targeted therapeutic interventions to counteract the adverse side effects of aging.

Diverse types of Th cells are known to characteristically influence the overall outcome of an immune response. Until recently, the known Th lineages included the Th1, Th2 and various regulatory, Treg, types which all display a remarkable plasticity, as overexpression of certain transcription factors in fully differentiated Th cells of one type can lead to a 'reprogramming' to other Th types. The epigenetic mechanisms involved in Th differentiation include chromatin modification, DNA methylation and self-reinforcing transcriptional networks. Recently, interleukin-17 (IL-17) secreting T cells were shown to constitute a separate Th lineage, termed Th17. This cell type has a strong proinflammatory role and is implicated in autoimmune diseases like arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. The cytokines transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and IL-6 have been shown to be crucial for Th17 differentiation, while single stimulation with TGF-beta leads to the development of Treg cells. Although several factors important for IL-6/TGF-beta signal transduction were shown to be necessary for the development of Th17 cells, the only true Th17 specific transcription factor identified thus far remains RORgammat. In this project we want to elucidate the general transcriptional network structures underlying Th17 differentiation, to study individual components of these, and to identify novel factors important in this process. We will employ a systems biology approach to address these subjects. The transcriptome of T cells stimulated under Th17 differentiating conditions will be analyzed at multiple timepoints by DNA microarray experiments. These data will be integrated with existing information from databases by various clustering algorithms to infer regulatory interactions. Once we have identified novel factors important for Th17 differentiation, these will be tested by in vitro and in vivo experiments.	Austrian Science Fund FWF	Erwin Schrödinger Programme	None	None
433	Prof Mary Herbert	Newcastle University	Institute of Cellular Medicine	2007-11-01	2010-10-31	Improving the efficiency of human somatic cell nuclear transfer	Therapeutic cloning offers the prospect of cell-based therapies without the risk of immune rejection. The success of therapeutic cloning depends on the development of reproducible methods for generating human embryonic stem cells (hES cells) from embryos produced by transplanting a nucleus of an adult somatic cells into an oocyte. The overall aim of this project is to increase the efficiency of nuclear transfer (NT) in human oocytes. A major obstacle is the scarcity of freshly harvested human oocytes. Altruistic donation is rare and carries the risk ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. To overcome this we propose to introduce an ?egg sharing? scheme in which selected women undergoing ovarian stimulation for fertility treatment donate half of their oocytes in return for a reduction in the price of treatment. This scheme has been approved by the HFEA and has been well received by patients. The main scientific areas of focus are: 1) Egg activation: we will test the efficacy of the sperm-specific protein phospholipase C ? (PLC?), and a constitutively active form of its primary molecular target, calmodulin-dependent kinaseII (CamKII), in promoting development of NT blastocysts. 2) Enucleation: we will test the hypothesis that removal of the meiotic spindle compromises the development of NT embryos. 3) Reprogramming: we will perform experiments in mouse and human oocytes to compare the efficiency of Oct4 demethylation and transcription in oocytes at different stages of maturation. The project brings together a unique combination of skills and experience in ethics and regulation of gamete/embryo donation; primate NT and ES cell derivation, cell biology of the oocyte, and the molecular mechanisms of epigenetic modification. Our combined expertise puts us in a strong position (i) to maximise the translational potential of NT for the treatment of disease (ii) to gain insights into the mechanisms by which the oocyte modulates the cell cycle and epigenetic regulation of the somatic cell genome.

434	Professor Masashi Narita	Cancer Research UK	None	2007-09-01	2010-08-31	Mechanism of HMGA action in senescence and tumorigenesis	Cellular senescence is a stable state of proliferative arrest in culture, which might provide a barrier to malignant transformation. Senescence can be induced by many stresses, such as telomere attrition, DNA damage, and oncogenes. Paradoxically, induction of senescence by oncogenes (oncogene-induced senescence: OIS) has been gaining increasing attention after the recent identification of OIS in premalignant tissues in vivo. However the mechanism underlying OIS is unknown. Previously, we have shown that human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs) accumulate senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHFs), which may provide a chromatin buffer that prevents activation of proliferation-associated genes by mitogenic transcription factors (Narita et al., Cell 2003, 113, 703). More recently we found that the high mobility group A (HMGA) proteins are essential components of SAHFs and contribute to the stability of senescence arrest (Narita et al., Cell 2006, 126, 503). HMGA proteins are non-histone chromatin proteins and effect transcription through chromatin remodeling. Generally, HMGA is only expressed in proliferating cells such as embryonic and tumour tissues, and thus is classified as an oncogene. Consistently, we have shown that HMGA can enhance both senescence and transformation activity of ras depending on the integrity of the senescence machinery, indicating that HMGA can have both oncogenic and anti-oncogenic functions depending on the context. To identify "HMGA-associated" senescence in tissues as well as factors that switch HMGA functions Characterization of tumour tissues Given that HMGA is up-regulated in both benign and malignant tumours, and that some premalignant tissues contain senescent cells, we hypothesize that HMGA contributes to OIS in vivo and mutations that disable the senescence machinery convert HMGA into an oncogene. To test this, in conjunction with the 'tumour specific' research groups at Cambridge Research Institute, we will characterize a variety of tumour specimens in human and mouse. Whenever possible, we will focus on premalignant tumours and examine the senescence markers, such SA-b-gal (when fresh samples are available), proliferation, p16, PML body, SAHFs, along with HMGA expression. In malignant tissues, we will explore the correlation between HMGA expression and other genetic/epigenetic mutations, which might be involved in the conversion of HMGA functions. We will also examine the correlation between the senescence phenotype and expression of MDM2/CDK4 (which are often co-amplified with HMGA2 in tumours) in HMGA2-positive tumours. Non-bias approach To ask how HMGA functions are switched, from pro-senescent to oncogenic, we will screen a stable RNAi library (with Dr Gregory Hannon in Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory) for genes whose suppression allows the bypass of HMGA-induced senescence using the HDF system. The genes identified by this screen could potentially be components of the senescence machinery, and possibly loss of these genes contribute to tumorigenesis cooperatively with HMGA up-regulation. Validation of the genes can be done in the same HDF system, where the senescence phenotype can be induced by various ways, and transformation assays are well established.

435	Dr Radhakrishnan	University of Oxford	None	2008-01-01	2010-12-31	Epigenetic modulators of gene expression in sepsis.	Sepsis is the syndrome of systemic inflammatory response to infection. Sepsis is common in Intensive Care Units (ICU) with significant mortality and financial burden. Evidence suggests that the risk of sepsis and clinical outcome is modulated by genetic factors. Exposure to endotoxin triggers a characteristic temporal pattern of expression of inflammatory mediators in leukocytes, resulting in an initial storm of proinflammatory mediators followed by gene silencing and an increase in expres sion of anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial genes. A key molecular mechanism controlling this process is gene-specific epigenetic modification. This fellowship will investigate the nature of chromatin modifications occurring at the promoter region of endotoxin tolerant and non-tolerant genes in sepsis and how this varies between individuals. Chromatin will be obtained from leucocytes of 50 patients admitted to ICU with community acquired pneumonia. The temporal pattern of histone modificatio ns and chromatin remodelling will be studied by collecting samples on days 1, 3 and 5 of admission. The role of DNA sequence polymorphism in modulating epigenetic modifications will be assessed using haplotype-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation. This will provide novel data in a disease context of a key regulatory process and how it varies in a haplotype specific manner in primary immune cells.

436	Prof. Dr. Wilfried ELLMEIER	Medical University of Vienna	None	2019-03-01	2023-02-28	Histone deacetylases as regulators of T-cell-mediated immunity	Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are key epigenetic and genetic regulators during development and cell differentiation. HDACs control the acetylation status of histones and non-histone proteins, thus modulating chromatin function and the activity of non-histone protein targets, respectively. Pan-HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) are clinically used in the treatment of cancer. Preclinical data indicate that HDAC modulation might be also beneficial for the therapy of immunological diseases although pan-HDACi can have adverse effects. Hence, potential benefits of pan-HDACi for the therapy of immune-mediated diseases may not outweigh the risks. Therefore, we hypothesize that subclass- or isoform-specific HDACi can diminish side effects and broaden their clinical application spectrum far beyond cancer. The overall aim of this 8-year SFB program is to provide an immunological and molecular rationale for using sub-class or isoform-specific HDACi in the treatment of T-cell-mediated diseases. In addition to the known epigenetic gene regulation of T-helper-cell (Th) function in physiology and pathology, accumulating evidence suggests essential roles of reversible lysine acetylation of non-histone proteins. Therefore, we want to investigate the cellular and molecular consequences of HDAC inhibition and deletion in different T cell-mediated inflammatory diseases. We will characterize acetyl-proteome profiles in Th lineage subsets and dissect how they are linked with Th effector functions in health, upon pathogenic fungal infections, skin inflammation, allergic airway inflammation, experimental autoimmune diseases (EAE and arthritis) in mice and rheumatoid arthritis in humans. We will generate comprehensive HDAC protein interaction maps and identify genetic networks in Th cells. In addition, the overlay of global transcriptomics with proteomics data will reveal how distinct HDAC complexes and their post-translational modifications control complex formation, function as well as activity. Moreover, we will determine the impact of HDACs and HDACi on Th lineage stability and plasticity. The integration of the acetyl-proteome, proteome and transcriptome of Th lineages will allow us to dissect both, chromatin and non-chromatin functions of HDACs. To achieve the ambitious but feasible aims, our interdisciplinary consortium will focus on a clinically relevant single adaptive immune cell type (Th cells) and a single class of HDACs (paradigm class I HDACs). We will exploit state-of-the art proteomics and next generation sequencing technologies, taking advantage of both animal and human systems to provide an integrative model of class I HDAC function in T-cells in homeostasis, but also how HDAC (mal)function affects immune disorders related to infection and autoimmunity. The expected outcome will fundamentally advance our understanding of how HDACs regulate Th cell lineages beyond the classical epigenetic control of gene expression. Further, it will provide a rationale for the development and application of new generation isoform-specific HDACi for the treatment of T-cell-mediated immune diseases. A major strength and added value of this consortium is the strong translational potential that will reach far beyond the funding period.

The control of both diseases relies on the production of interferon-gamma (IFNg) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and on the generation of antimicrobial molecules such as nitric oxide (NO). NO production by inducible NO synthase (iNOS) requires the amino acid L-arginine, which is also a substrate of arginase (Arg) 1. As Arg1 is co-induced during infections, it is capable to deprive iNOS of L-arginine, to impede the release of NO and to promote the survival of intracellular microorganisms. We previously observed that TNF protects from severe L. infantum infection by suppressing Arg1 expression in myeloid cells which could be traced back an effect of TNF on chromatin remodeling as suggested by reduced levels of acetylation of lysine 27 of histone H3, which is a histone mark linked to transcriptional activation at the Arg1 promoter/enhancer in macrophages. The molecular mechanisms that account for this epigenetic regulation are currently unknown. Another set of preliminary studies revealed that S. enterica serotype Typhimurium (S. typhimurium), the mouse correlate of human S. typhi, which - similar to Leishmania parasites - is controlled by IFNg, TNF and iNOS in vivo, is a strong inducer of Arg1 in macrophages. Hypothesis and aims: Based on these results we hypothesize that (1) Arg1 of myeloid cells, induced by microbes is a critical factor that determines host susceptibility to intracellular pathogens and that (2) TNF as well as IFNg protect against NO-sensitive intracellular microbes at least in part by unleashing the enzymatic activity of iNOS via epigenetic repression of Arg1. The central goals and methods of our application are the analysis of (1) the molecular and epigenetic mechanism of Arg1 suppression by TNF or IFNg, (2) the expression, regulation and function of Arg1 in visceral leishmaniasis caused by L. infantum, and in systemic S. typhimurium infection. These investigations will be performed by a combined approach employing infection models of mice including animals with specific deletion of Arg1 in myeloid cells along with a systemic analysis of transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of Arg1 by the different stimuli along with their impact on innate immune function and host control of infection. Specific attention will be paid to the evaluation of histone modifications associated with active, poised or repressed promoter/enhancer elements using ChIP-Seq methods, chromatin accessibility (ATAC-Seq) and genomic distribution analysis of chromatin remodellers (e.g. histone acetyltransferases [HAT] and deacetylases [HDACs]). We will also employ bioinformatic and genetic approaches as well as screens of small molecule inhibitor-libraries to identify potentially drugable regulators of the epigenetic suppression of Arg1. Candidates will be functionally validated in vivo. Expected results and outlook: We expect to generate key insights into the mechanisms of host susceptibility to two important infectious diseases. In addition, we are confident to elucidate the genomic and epigenomic details of Arg1 expression and ist regulation by proinflammatory cytokines, which will be of general relevance to combat infections with NO-sensitive intracellular pathogens. The long-term perspective of the project is clearly the development of new drugs for the treatment of infections with intracellular pathogens based on the tissue-specific inactivation of the Arg1 pathway by chromatin regulators. Partners: This consortium brings together applicants who have demonstrated scientific competence and productivity in areas of research that are highly relevant for the project.

This project aims to study developmental plasticity of social behaviour pursuing three major aims: (i) to identify phenotypic effects of early environment on social behaviour and their fitness benefits and associated trade-offs in the ecological context; (ii) to expand the study of the evolutionary ecology of social plasticity with research on underlying molecular and endocrine mechanisms.; and (iii) to investigate how animals integrate multiple environmental input by means of a plastic response. To pursue these aims I shall combine laboratory and field experiments, ecological surveys and evolutionary modelling with the study of the ontogeny of gene expression and the organization of hormonal axes. My study organism will be the highly social cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher, which has turned into a model system for studies of social evolution at many different levels, including population genetics, ecology, life history evolution, behaviour, morphology, gene expression, hormone physiology and energetics. These fish form complex social networks where all aspects of life involve social interactions at various levels. Together with a solid knowledge base of the biology of this species and its outstanding methodological suitability, this model system provides exceptional opportunities to investigate the fitness related aspects of social development that are the objective of this study. Three major approaches will be used to achieve the aims outlined above. (1) Young N. pulcher will be experimentally exposed to different levels of social and spatial complexity and varying levels of predation risk during early ontogeny. I shall investigate resulting phenotypic responses, in particular predicted trade-offs between social competence, learning ability and memory capacity, and risk avoidance skills at different stages throughout life. Moreover, I shall apply behavioural essays and measure fitness in terms of survival chances, reproductive performance and dispersal success. In the field, lifetime fitness of individually marked fish will be compared between individuals from social groups of low and high complexity (small and large families). (2) To unravel the physiological mechanisms responsible for effects of the early environment on social behaviour and the involved trade-offs we shall study gene expression during the course of plastic development (collaboration with N. Aubin-Horth, Quebec Univ.). We shall take serial samples of young from the treatment groups created by environmental manipulations as outlined in (1). By time series sampling during early life stages we shall be able to distinguish causes from effects of behavioural variation. Sampling later in life allows to check for the long-term persistence of gene expression differences. We shall measure circulating cortisol levels, determine the expression levels of corticoid receptors in whole brains by qRTPCR and compare expression levels between treatment groups in different brain regions by in situ hybridization. One of the most important epigenetic mechanisms during development is methylation or demethylation of DNA as it can silence or activate genes, respectively. As this mechanism may cause persistent, plastic changes in social behaviour, we aim to detect differential methylation patterns in the brain in response to early social environment. (3) To investigate the integration of multiple environmental cues young N. pulcher will receive information on the safety of the environment either (a) by maternal signals through yolk corticosteroid levels, or (b) from their own, post-natal experience. By the experimental treatment these cues will be either congruent or conflicting. I shall test for synergistic and antagonistic effects of the two cues, and whether young prioritize maternal signals or information accrued by own sampling. Individual-based simulations will be employed to find simple decision rules that can be used by animals to solve a complex problem: to show an optimal degree of plasticity of traits in fluctuating environments across all ages.

441	Univ.Prof. Dr. Heinrich KOVAR	CCRI - CHILDREN'S CANCER RESEARCH INSTITUTE	None	2013-04-01	2016-03-31	Prospective Validation of Biomarkers in Ewing Sarcoma for Personalised Treatment (PROVABES)	Ewing sarcoma is a big challenge for oncologists since about 40% of patients cannot be cured with current multimodal treatment regimens. Several putative prognostic markers have been described in retrospective studies of small patient cohorts, but only one (EWS-FLI1 fusion type) has so far been prospectively tested, with negative results. The “PROspective VAlidation of Biomarkers in Ewing Sarcoma for personalised translational medicine” (PROVABES) consortium was therefore formed to validate previously described candidate molecular biomarkers of good/bad prognosis, alone and in combination. Biomarkers associated with poor or good prognosis are either themselves involved in disease pathogenesis and/or treatment response, or surrogates or products of pathways essential for disease progression. Drivers of disease progression are likely to show the highest stability as biomarkers and may even serve as potential therapeutic targets. Thus, the functional characterization of prognostically relevant molecules aids the prospective validation in patients by supplying mechanistic explanations for the clinical correlations under study. While for several of the PROVABES molecules (CXCR4, STEAP1, EZH2, PARP1) ample preclinical functional data already exist, this is not the case for candidate targets of recently described Ewing sarcoma predisposition loci (Postel-Vinay et al., 2012) (WP1.2), and microRNA hsa-mir-34a (Nakatani et al., 2012) (WP 2). As an added value to the PROVABES consortium, WP4 is an exploratory work package aiming at the definition of the relevant molecular targets of these epigenetic (miRNA, and SNP) biomarkers. In close collaboration with our partners at Rizzoli Institute Bologna, Katia Scotlandi/Piero Picci (hsa-mir-34a), and at Institut Curie Paris, Franck Tirode/ Olivier Delattre (predisposition SNPs on chromosomes 10 and 15), we will investigate the functional relevance of previously identified candidate target genes. These targets have been selected because of their proximity to the marker SNPs (BMF and SIRT1), respectively based on physical interaction of their mRNA products with hsa-mir-34a-containing RISC complexes in a Ewing sarcoma cell line (TBL1XR1, XBP1, ARL6IP1, CAMK1D, TMEM189, RBMX). To this end we will establish an in vitro functional analysis pipeline (Deliverable D4.2), which is based on differential expression of these markers in 4 sets of paired Ewing sarcoma cell lines from localized tumors and corresponding metastases (test panel), and 6 cell lines each of localized tumors and unrelated metastases (validation panel). First, the test cell line panel will be analysed by Affymetrix OncoScanTM (WP1.1) and RNA next generation sequencing (RNA-seq, WP1.2) to characterize gene copy number, expression and sequence variations between localized and corresponding metastasis derived cell lines (Deliverable D4.1). Cell line results will be compared to primary tumor results from WP1.2. We will introduce hsa-mir-34a mimics, respectively knockdown endogenous hsa-mir-34a in selected cell lines from the validation panel to functionally confirm the 6 chosen candidate targets as hsa-mir-34a regulated genes. Subsequently, we will quantify the effect of experimental modulation of the candidate targets on cell growth under adherent and anchorage independent conditions, migration and invasion. These parameters will be analysed under normoxic and hypoxic growth conditions, as we described previously (Aryee et al., 2010). We expect that this in vitro functional validation of presumed target genes for chromosomes 10 and 15-associated Ewing sarcoma predisposition SNPs (SIRT1, BMF; Deliverable D4.3), and for hsa-mir-34a (TBL1XR1, XBP1, ARL6IP1, CAMK1D, TMEM189, RBMX; Deliverable D4.4) will identify the biological mediators of differential clinical course observed to be associated with these epigenetic markers.

Depression, anxiety disorders, migraine and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), occur with high and increasing prevalence but despite treatment improvements, their management is still unsatisfactory. As the molecular disease mechanisms are not fully understood, current drug therapies are mainly symptomatic and often cause side effects. An evident need towards advanced treatment options is to identify signaling pathways suitable for novel therapeutic strategies. Aim of this research network is to exploit our research experience with different well-validated disease models (PD, AD, Multiple System Atrophy, fear and anxiety disorders, depression) and selected patient cohorts and combine them with local basic research strengths to comprehensively study two signaling pathways that bear high potential for innovative therapeutic intervention: L-type Ca2+ channels (LTCCs) and epigenetic modulators, in particular histone deacetylases (HDACs). This was motivated by the fact that both pathways appear to participate in the etiology of several of these disorders, as well as by recent preliminary findings from our consortium suggesting that both signaling pathways can be (patho)physiologically linked to each other. Based on existing collaborations between network partners, we now systematically study the role of different LTCC isoforms in the etiology of PD, parkinsonism associated with Multiple System Atrophy, and AD. Our translational approach will range from the molecular level to in vivo studies, including electrophysiological investigations of the biophysical and pharmacological properties of different LTCC isoforms, their role in functional signaling networks in dopaminergic neurons in vital slices and in vivo studies in animal disease models to assess their potential significance as neuroprotective drug targets. For these and other CNS diseases we will also investigate the etiological role of epigenetic and, based on local expertise, non-coding RNA (ncRNA)-mediated mechanisms from various perspectives. This will involve identification of disease-relevant ncRNAs, biochemical properties of HDAC complexes in healthy and diseased brains and studying possible direct links between Ca2+ channel signaling and histone-modifying mechanisms. For example, we will study molecular mechanisms underlying disturbed fear memory regulation, in which both, LTCCs and epigenetic mechanism seem to be involved. This will include investigating the role of HDACs in studies with novel isoform-selective inhibitors. As both LTCC and HDAC signaling also affects neurogenesis, the molecular basis for this modulation will also be investigated in normal and diseased brain. Moreover, our efforts will also involve efforts to develop LTCC blockers with preferential CNS targeting as well as novel compounds interfering with isoform-selective HDAC activity or, as a novel concept, with protein binding to methylated DNA. Furthermore clinical investigations in our patient cohorts with Multiple System Atrophy and certain Ca2+ channel diseases (e.g. Familial Hemiplegic Migraine type 1) will be merged with insights from appropriate animal disease models to provide a translational strategy for developing disease biomarkers for progression and disease severity of these CNS disorders.

Using information about past experiences is critical for optimal decision-making in a fluctuating environment. While the evolutionary benefits of learning are clear, very little is known about its origins. We usually think of learning as a trait limited to organisms with nervous systems precluding its existence in non-neural organisms. Our recent results demonstrate that the hallmarks for learning occur at the level of single cells and raise the possibility that learning might pre-date the evolution of nervous systems. Our project aims to understand learning in the acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum, an emerging model organism– at the verge between the microbial world and higher multicellular organisms. We will adopt a multidisciplinary approach requiring the participation of an ethologist (AD), a molecular ecologist (MG) and two physicists (MD, APE) to observe and model the earliest manifestations of learning. First, at the behavioral level, we will study the whole spectrum of learning abilities in these non-neural organisms and propose new experimental protocols. We will: 1) analyze the conditions that bring about learning in slime molds, 2) determine if learning extends to various sensorial modalities, 3) measure the memory span of theses unicellular organisms, 4) test if associative learning is possible in slime molds, and 5) examine how long the information is retained within the cell. Second, we will investigate the possible mechanisms governing learning in slime molds. We will combine observations and modelling to investigate how learning triggers the internal reorganization that results in behavioral output and we will investigate how epigenetic regulatory mechanisms can underpin learning. Lastly, at an evolutionary level, we will investigate how variable the learning abilities are within and between species and then examine whether learning in slime molds significantly improves their fitness. We are confident that an intensification of research on unicellular organisms such as P. polycephalum will aid the comprehension of learning, which is a major foundation pillar for understanding fundamental principles of life. By studying learning in non-neural organisms, we will broaden the traditional definitions of learning and memory. The implications of our work will impact several disciplines, including evolutionary biology, neurobiology, computational biology and cognition. The project offers the chance for all partners to plan and conduct experiments to unify an understanding of learning at the cellular level. To fulfill our objectives, we will need to rely on our collective expertise in different areas of science. By integrating our behavioral, biophysical, and epigenetic perspectives, we will develop a unified model of learning at the cellular level. Such a feat will not be possible without taking a multidisciplinary approach, as we will need to use various methods from biophysics, state-of-the-art imaging techniques, molecular biology and behavioral tracking to achieve a holistic view of basic principles of learning. Our approach will enrich all participants, lead to a paradigm shift in the study of learning, and open up a new research field of primitive cognition	Austrian Science Fund FWF	International programmes	274898.31	EUR

HSCs are largely residing in the long bones and are the very ancestral cells to every blood cell in adult vertebrates. The unique feature of all stem cells, including HSCs, is their exceptional ability to divide asymmetrically giving rise to two different kinds of offspring. One daughter cell becomes an HSC itself (self-renews) to maintain the HSC pool, whereas the second daughter cell pursues a differentiation fate to ultimately give rise to terminally differentiated mature blood cells. Most cell fate decisions are executed through the action of transcription factors (e.g. GATA-1, PU.1), and there is a comprehensive understanding of the genetic programs enforced by these factors during differentiation. However, it is still largely unexplored which upstream factors may regulate the expression of these lineage-determining transcription factors. The family of polycomb group proteins (PcG) have been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation, genomic imprinting, X inactivation, and - most interestingly - in maintenance of stem cell identity via epigenetic suppression of differentiation promoting cues (e.g. lineage-determining transcription factors). The polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) catalyzes the addition of methyl groups onto lysine 27 residues of histone H3 (H3K27). H3K27 trimethylation leads to the recruitment of polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) resulting in permanent repression of the respective gene. Until recently it was believed that H3K27 trimethylation was a permanent epigenetic mark, only removable via histone eviction. However, the recent identification of the H3K27 demethylases (HDMs) Utx (Ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat gene, X chromosome) and Jmjd3 (Jumonji domain containing 3) introduced an unexpected flexibility in terms of H3K27 trimethylation mediated gene suppression. Given that H3K27 trimethylation can be removed in an enzymatically directed manner and the well-documented importance of epigenetic regulation of gene transcription during differentiation, it is appealing to deliberate whether H3K27 HDMs might be the very molecules regulating lineage-decisions upstream of the well-known lineage-specific transcription factors. This proposal aims to address the potential role of H3K27 histone demethylation during hematopoietic ontogeny and differentiation to identify epigenetic mechanisms operating on top of well-known lineage-determining transcription factors during hematopoietic differentiation. This will enhance our understanding of how lineage decisions during hematopoiesis are made, and - in addition - may allow the identification of yet unknown cell fate determining factors. Therefore, the applicant strives to 1.) generate conditional knockout mice of the histone demethylases Utx and Jmjd3; 2.) analyze their hematopoietic-specific deletion phenotypes during ontogeny and differentiation; and 3.) develop a method of highly sensitive chromatin immunoprecipitation from as few as 1000 cells to enable whole genome methylation mapping of HSCs and their progeny.

In contrast to the rapidly growing number of factors implicated in heterochromatin formation and propagation, little is known about the mechanisms that actively reverse the process in any eukaryote. The purpose of the project is to understand the control and function of heterochromatin disassembly using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Cytological and molecular studies of the vegetative and the sperm nuclei from Arabidopsis pollen have revealed a global heterochromatin disassembly process in the vegetative nucleus. Three complementary forward and reverse genetic approaches, for which the necessary tools are available, will be employed to isolate the genes involved in the process: (1) transgenic lines with fluorescent tags for the in vivo identification of the vegetative nucleus and for centromeric heterochromatin; (2) pre-selected T-DNA insertion lines carrying gametophytic mutations; and (3) tissue-specific transcriptome data. Additionally, possible genetic alterations, including DNA deletion and amplification, in the genomes of the vegetative and the sperm nuclei will be investigated using microarray-based technology. Results from these studies will allow novel insights into the plasticity and dynamics of heterochromatin.	Austrian Science Fund FWF	Stand-Alone Project	None	None

A unique vital feature of gametogenesis is resetting the genetic and epigenetic plan for totipotency. Current evidence suggests that in the germ cell lineage of mammals and plants, epigenetic reprogramming occurs on a genome-wide scale, which profoundly reconfigures the landscape of DNA methylation and chromatin dynamics. The purpose of the proposed work is to investigate how these reprogramming events are controlled and play roles in the plant male gametophyte (pollen) using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Specifically, this research program is designed to (1) elucidate roles for active DNA demethylation in pollen, which is a process that requires the DEMETER DNA glycosylase, and (2) elucidate mechanisms that regulate reconfigurations of chromatin dynamics in pollen. The genetic and functional genomic approaches in Part 1 of the research project will provide novel insights into the function of DNA demethylation in plant reproduction. The analysis of the heterochromatin decondensation defective 1 (hdd1) mutant and the isolation of hdd1 suppressors in Part 2 of the project will help to understand the control and function of the dynamic chromatin remodeling during gametogenesis.

Dr. Ovidiu PAUN	University of Vienna	None	2006-09-01	2008-08-31	Genetic consequences of allopolyploidy in Dactylorhiza	Hybridization and polyploidization are now recognized as major phenomena in the evolution of plants, promoting genetic diversity, adaptive radiation and speciation. New findings underline this idea: the interactions of the combined genomes in allopolyploids induce waves of genetic and epigenetic alterations that are of critical importance for the evolutionary fate of the hybrids. Indeed, such alterations like chromosomal rearrangements, transposable element activation, DNA sequence elimination and gene silencing have the potential to result in novel expression patterns and new phenotypes, which together with heterosis and gene redundancy might confer on hybrids an elevated evolutionary potential, with profound effects at scales ranging from molecular to ecological. An important feature of hybridization is that it has the potential to occur repeatedly between different populations of the same parental taxa, leading to arrays of allopolyploids that subsequently interbreed. For example the allotetraploid pair D. traunsteineri and D. majalis s.s., from the Dactylorhiza incarnata/maculata complex, resulted both from hybridization of D. fuchsii and D. incarnata. To further our understanding of the consequences of hybridization and genome duplication on polyploid genome natural evolution and adaptation to the environment, I propose here the use of this allotetraploid pair with similar genetic background, but difference in their evolutionary history and ecology: D. traunsteineri is a recently formed, morphologically variable hybrid with a narrower distribution and D. majalis s.s. has a wider distribution and is much more uniform morphologically. A copy DNA (cDNA) amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) genome-wide survey of the transcriptome, together with a methylation sensitive AFLP (MSAP) approach is expected to indicate the functional relevance of correlations between gene expression and the development of a phenotype, the direction and stochastic nature of the diploidization process, and the molecular mechanisms that result in adaptation to different ecologies/habitats and therefore in reproductive isolation. The methods proposed are among the most modern and advanced strategies to provide inferences on the principles of genomic responses to allopolyploidization.

This will involve identification of disease-relevant ncRNAs, biochemical properties of HDAC complexes in healthy and diseased brains and studying possible direct links between Ca2+ channel signaling and histone-modifying mechanisms. For example, we will study molecular mechanisms underlying disturbed fear memory regulation, in which both, LTCCs and epigenetic mechanism seem to be involved. This will include investigating the role of HDACs in studies with novel isoform-selective inhibitors. As both LTCC and HDAC signaling also affects neurogenesis, the molecular basis for this modulation will also be investigated in normal and diseased brain. Moreover, our efforts will also involve efforts to develop LTCC blockers with preferential CNS targeting as well as novel compounds interfering with isoform-selective HDAC activity or, as a novel concept, with protein binding to methylated DNA. Furthermore clinical investigations in our patient cohorts with Multiple System Atrophy and certain Ca2+ channel diseases (e.g. Familial Hemiplegic Migraine type 1) will be merged with insights from appropriate animal disease models to provide a translational strategy for developing disease biomarkers for progression and disease severity of these CNS disorders.

Mutations in lamins and some associated proteins are linked to human diseases, ranging from muscular dystrophies to accelerated aging syndromes. The molecular basis of these diseases is not understood. In these study we will test and molecularly characterize a novel disease-relevant function of lamins in adult stem cell regulation in regenerative tissues. While most previous studies have focused on the lamina network at the nuclear periphery, our recent work revealed a lamina-independent pool of lamins in the nuclear interior, which requires a specific lamin-binding partner, lamin-associated polypeptide LAP2?. Using LAP2? knockout mice and primary cells derived therefrom we found that the nucleoplasmic lamin-LAP2? complex affects cell cycle progression of early progenitor cells in regenerative tissues in a retinoblastoma protein (Rb)-dependent manner. The molecular mechanisms of these pathways, however, are still unknown and will be addressed in this study: Aim 1 will identify the molecular pathways regulating nucleoplasmic lamins. We will test the involvement of lamin modifications and analyze the effect of LAP2? on lamin stability and assembly in vitro. Aim 2 will test how LAP2? affects the Rb pathway at molecular level. We will generate Rb1+/- / LAP2?-/- double mutant mice to identify a genetic link of Rb and LAP2? in vivo. Furthermore, using primary myoblasts derived from LAP2?-deficient and overexpressing mice we will address the mechanistic details of LAP2?’s function in cell cycle regulation and during in vitro differentiation to myofibers. In particular, we will test the role of LAP2? in Rb modifications and in the regulation of transcriptional repressors and epigenetic pathways, and we will identify deregulated genes and promoters in LAP2?-mutant cells. Aim 3 will test the LAP2? gain-of-function phenotype at organismal level by overexpression of LAP2? in muscle satellite cells or muscle fibers in transgenic mice. We will analyze muscle physiology, function and regeneration in vivo and test myoblast differentiation ex vivo in primary cultures. Finally, Aim 4 will test how mutations in LAP2? linked to striated muscle disorders in patients affect lamin interactions, Rb regulation, myoblast self renewal and differentiation, using primary patient cells and mouse myoblasts expressing mutated LAP2? variants. Overall, our studies will change the current view on lamin functions providing a novel concept on the involvement of nucleoplasmic lamins in adult stem cell regulation, which is highly relevant for lamin-linked diseases.

Besides chromosome architecture proteins, nucleosomal remodelers and epigenetic pathways, nuclear lamins are emerging as important players in chromatin regulation. Lamins exist in two modes: At the nuclear periphery they form a stable filamentous scaffold called the nuclear lamina. Lamins A and C localize also throughout the nucleus in a mobile pool, but neither the regulation nor functions of these nucleoplasmic lamins are well understood. While the nuclear lamina anchors transcriptionally silent, heterochromatic genomic regions, so called lamina-associated domains (LADs), to the nuclear periphery, we recently showed that lamins A/C in the nuclear interior associate with transcriptionally active euchromatic regions, together with their interaction partner lamin-associated polypeptide 2 (LAP2) alpha. Depletion of LAP2alpha and nucleoplasmic lamins A/C caused a reduction of both active and repressive epigenetic marks at sites where chromatin associations of LAP2alpha and lamins A/C were lost. Our data suggest that LAP2alpha and lamins A/C may regulate chromatin organization and, in particular, chromatin accessibility, thereby affecting gene expression on a genome-wide level. In this project we will test this hypothesis and elucidate molecular mechanisms involved in lamins A/C-LAP2alpha-mediated chromatin regulation using a combination of molecular biological and bioinformatic approaches. Firstly, we will perform genome-wide transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC)- and micrococcal nuclease (MNase) assays combined with deep sequencing in LAP2alpha knockout versus wildtype fibroblasts, and correlate chromatin accessibility changes with changes in chromatin-binding profiles of lamins A/C and epigenetic alterations in the absence of LAP2alpha. Secondly, we will express LAP2alpha mutants in LAP2alpha knockout cells to test whether its chromatin-binding and/or lamin-binding domains are necessary for chromatin regulation. Thirdly, we will identify proteome-wide interactions of LAP2alpha and lamins A/C with chromatin-associated proteins using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectroscopy. For the most promising candidates, we will study the effects of LAP2alpha/lamins A/C depletion on their functions and particularly on their potential role in chromatin accessibility. Lastly, we will address the physiological relevance of identified mechanisms by testing changes in chromatin accessibility during in vitro myoblast differentiation in LAP2alpha wildtype versus knockout myoblasts and correlating these with gene expression changes and effects on differentiation. Overall this study will provide novel mechanistic insight into the role of lamins A/C and LAP2alpha in chromatin regulation and gene expression. In view of the involvement of lamin mutations in diseases, such as premature aging syndromes, for which changes in chromatin have been reported, our data may also shed light on potential disease mechanisms.

Dr. Alexander HASLBERGER	University of Vienna	None	2014-03-01	2016-12-31	DNA mutations in metabolic syndrom and epigenetic regulation of repair enzymes	Metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus type 2 are associated with a systemic low-grade inflammation and enhanced oxidative stress which is caused by endogen produced reactive oxygen species (ROS). Both conditions fortify each other and are responsible for diverse symptoms of the metabolic syndrome such as insulin resistance. Oxidative stress is especially elevated in extended adipose tissue and under chronic exposure to free saturated fatty acids. Saturated fatty acids activate the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase (NADPH) which leads to a higher ROS burden. Long chain poly-unsaturated fatty acids have the opposite effect. ROS causes DNA damages which are recovered by DNA repair mechanisms or prevented by endogen and exogen antioxidants. Epigenetic mechanisms regulate mRNA expression of a variety of genes including the ones involved in inflammatory processes, ROS production and quenching and DNA repair mechanisms. DNA methylation of several genes was found to be altered under oxidative stress or inflammatory conditions. The aim of the present project is to analyse alterations of epigenetic DNA methylation and mRNA expression of genes involved in DNA damage repair, oxidative stress and inflammatory processes caused by a high fat diet, which is typical for western countries, enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids and with or without antioxidants. Furthermore, the influence of this diet on inflammatory pathways and on ROS formation will be investigated. An animal and a cell culture model were chosen for these investigations. Two groups of C57BL/6J mice are fed a high-fat and a normal diet with or without addition of vitamin E and C for up to three months. After the intervention, adipose and colon tissue will be stored for analyses. In a study on Caco-2 cell, they will be treated with palmitate, docosahexaenoic acid, hydrogen peroxide, folate, vitamin E and C and combinations of these reagents. Further, two NADPH family members will be knocked down. DNA methylation of distinct genes will be analysed in all collected samples by pyrosequencing and DNA methylation array. mRNA expression will be assessed using a microarray and quantitative PCR. Microsatellite instability, DNA strand breaks and the total antioxidative capacity will also be investigated. Findings of this study will help to understand patho-epigenetic processes in obesity associated oxidative stress and inflammation. This knowledge may improve the therapy of metabolic syndrome and diabestes mellitus type 2 (DMT2) by influencing epigenetic, oxidative and inflammatory pathways by nutritional interventions.

Although major advances in the treatment of MPN have been made in recent years, most MPN are incurable chronic disorders with substantial morbidity and mortality. The only curative treatment approach that can be offered at present is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Unfortunately, this procedure can only be performed in a small group of patients (young and fit). In all other patients, management is largely based on symptom-control and the use of growth-inhibitory drugs. However, most drugs used thus far in MPN, including the recently developed tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), have little if any curative potential. In addition, resistance to growth-inhibitory drugs is often seen in advanced MPN. So far, little is known about molecules, signaling networks, and mechanisms underlying disease evolution, progression, and resistance in various MPN. The situation is complicated by the fact that neoplastic stem cells (SC) exhibit intrinsic resistance, have multiple interactions with the SC-protective microenvironment, the so-called ?stem cell niche?, and acquire resistance in multiple subclones during disease evolution. Finally, the genetic background as well as epigenetic mechanisms are considered to play a role in disease evolution and progression in MPN. The general aim of this research program is to address the cellular, biochemical and functional complexity in various MPN by an integrated multidisciplinary approach, to exploit network analyses and resulting concepts to define critical target profiles in neoplastic (stem) cells, and to develop targeted treatment-strategies. The specific long-term aim of the SFB is to develop novel SC-eradicating treatment approaches in Ph+ and Ph- MPN. Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) will serve as a paradigmatic disease model in this SFB. In addition, the SFB will focus on JAK2 V617F-mutated MPN, KIT D816V-mutated systemic mastocytosis (SM) and mast cell leukemia (MCL), and FIP1L1/PDGFRA+ chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL). It can be expected that the SFB will substantially contribute to a better understanding of molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the etiology, progression, and resistance of neoplastic cells in these MPN. Furthermore, data generated in this SFB should provide a solid basis for the development of improved diagnostic and therapeutic concepts in these neoplasms.

Prof. Dr. Gerda EGGER	Medical University of Vienna	None	2009-02-01	2011-01-31	Epigenetics in NPM-ALK Positive Lymphomas	Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) are a rising group of malignant tumors, with more than 800 new cases in Austria per year. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), a highly malignant T cell NHL, is frequently associated with a genetic translocation generating the NPM-ALK fusion protein. The fusion is highly oncogenic in vitro and in vivo and has been shown to interact with a variety of oncogenic networks. Besides genetic mutations, epigenetic aberrations have been associated with numerous tumors. Silencing of tumor suppressor genes by DNA methylation was shown to be a hallmark of human cancer. A second epigenetic pathway is dependent on the action of Polycomb proteins, which can act as oncogenes. Interestingly, only a limited amount of literature exists on the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in ALCL. Here we propose to analyze the role of epigenetics on the development and progression of NPM-ALK positive lymphomas. We plan to use an integrated approach to study changes in DNA methylation and Polycomb occupancy in human tumor samples, cell lines and in a transgenic mouse model. We will use human tissue arrays to determine the expression status of Polycomb proteins in several NPM-ALK positive and negative lymphoma patient samples. Custom tiling arrays will be used to determine the epigenetic profile of different ALCL cell lines. Furthermore, we plan to use NPM-ALK transgenic mice to elucidate the role of DNA methylation and Polycomb proteins in murine lymphomagenesis and to isolate putative novel targets of epigenetic aberrations. To investigate the biological importance of these aberrations, we will treat human cell lines with specific epigenetic drugs. We will intercross mice with a T-cell specific deletion of Dnmt1 with NPM-ALK transgenic mice to study the effects of DNA hypomethylation on NPM-ALK dependent tumor-formation and -progression. The use of epigenetic drugs, such as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and histone deacetylase inhibitors has been approved by the US food and drug administration for the treatment of specific hematological malignancies, and clinical trials have shown the beneficial effects for several tumor types of tumors. Thus, our study may elucidate novel molecular mechanisms of the disease and provide a rationale for the application of epigenetic drugs to target ALCL.

However, recent work comparing at high resolution binding of a diverse set of four tissue-specific transcription factors in mouse and human indicates that most binding events are very poorly conserved. To explore the mechanisms by which tissue-specific transcriptional control is conserved and diverged, (1) we are extending our prior mouse-human transcription factor binding comparisons to include dog to begin unraveling the mechanisms that determine orthologous transcription factor binding events in all three species. (2) In addition, we are using a unique model system, namely, a viable mouse line that contains a complete copy of human chromsome 21, to determine the complete set of binding events for tissue-specific transcription factors (as well as the chromatin state) between orthologous mouse and human sequences in a uniform nuclear environment.

We plan to examine the impact of telomere loss-of-integrity in a genetic setting where the capacity to upregulate TERT is retained. Firstly, we plan to ascertain whether limiting telomerase function exacerbates (or protects against) the decline in stem cell function and increase in genetic instability observed during mammalian ageing. Secondly, we plan to combine our model of limiting telomere function (heterozygosity of mTert) with other genetic backgrounds that promote genetic instability, to determine the impact of changes in telomere length associated with limiting telomerase. We also plan to attempt to reverse the phenotypes associated with telomere shortening using a novel therapeutic compound in development at Geron. Lastly, we plan to undertake an unbiased genetic approach, using retroviral tagging, to identify novel chromosomal loci whose altered regulation might contribute to genetic instability when telomere function is limited. Taken together, these studies are designed to elucidate the genetic and epigenetic modifiers of telomere function in vivo, and how these changes impact on the propensity to age-associated diseases in mammals.

Repetitive DNA is a major driver of genome evolution with most plant genomes containing large amounts of repetitive DNA. Despite enormous progress, numerous questions concerning the importance of chromosomal restructuring and changes of genome composition for the diversification and speciation remain. A suitable and attractive system for addressing aspects of genomic evolution in a group of closely related taxa is provided by the genus Capsicum (Solanaceae). This genus of c. 40 species is centred in Middle-South America and is of great economic significance, because it includes the sweet and hot chili peppers, vegetables and spices consumed worldwide. All of the species analyzed so far are diploids, with two polyphyletic base chromosome numbers (x = 12, 13) and significant variation in the heterochromatin content and genome size. Hypotheses on the species relationships exist, as well as hypotheses on the chromosomal and genome size evolution in the genus. Recent methodological advances, especially low-cost next generation sequencing (NGS) applied to repetitive genome fraction and implemented by molecular, bioinformatic, and cytogenetic techniques offer new tools to further advance our understanding of the evolutionary trajectories of this important genus in particular, and of genome evolution in general. In the proposed project a combination of methods and techniques will be used to analyze in detail the interspecific relationships and the evolution of genomes of the genus Capsicum. Phylogenetic approaches will allow inference of the evolutionary history of the genus, and will be complemented with in-depth analyzes of genome evolution accompanying species diversification and domestication, as well as analyses of genetic bases of self-incompatibility. The comparative study of this genus will address significant evolutionary questions concerning the impact and frequencies of genomic changes on diversification and speciation. Specifically, the molecular phylogeny of Capsicum will be completed and provide reliable hypothesis on the evolutionary differentiation of the genus. This in turn will allow inferrence of the ancrestral character states for various characters, partcilarly those related to genome composition and structure. It will allow hypotheses on the trends and mechanisms of chromosomal evolution in the genus (e.g., origin of two different chromosome base numbers, x = 12 13) and the origin and composition of heterochromatin to be proposed and tested. The repetitive genome fraction of all Capsicum species (wild and cultivated) will be specifically targeted to correlate the genome size variations with the origin and/or the amplification of various repeats. Finally, the genetics of different reproductive strategies among different strains of the cultivated chili C. pubescens will be addressed through S-genotyping and exploring self-incompatibility and its importance for species diversity.

Although many tumor suppressors and oncogenes, and their relevant cellular pathways have been characterized in some detail, many aspects of cancer remain poorly understood. Critically, for most cancers the genetic diversity and complexity has hampered the development of efficient targeted therapies. To tackle the challenges of cancer treatment a new therapeutic approach is required. Attacking the weaknesses of cancer cells, as opposed to the strengths (i.e. the oncogenes that drive cancer), can provide highly effective and specific treatments. These cancer vulnerabilities or Achilles' heels can be the consequence of deregulated cellular pathways caused by tumorigenic events such as the loss of a tumor suppressor or the deregulation of an oncogene. The concept is derived from classical genetics and is referred to as synthetic sickness/lethality (SSL). Geneticists speak of a SSL interaction between two genes when a phenotype is only observed when both genes are inactivated. Importantly, this principle is also observed in mammalian cells and has been recently exploited to specifically target human cancer cells. However, these discoveries were made serendipitously and a methodical analysis of SSL in human cancer cells would therefore be invaluable. Recent technological advances, including RNAi, now allow biologists for the first time to develop methods to systematically explore synthetic lethality in mammalian cells The project described here offers a head-on method to identify synthetic lethal genetic inter-actions in cancer cells. It uses a combination of technologies including shRNA barcoding technology, assay multiplexing and compound library screens resulting in a unique and powerful method. To acquire mechanistic understanding of identified synthetic lethal interactions, functional validation and detailed follow-up studies will be a key component of this project. Together with a fingerprint of the genetic changes in patients' tumors, knowledge on the SSL interactions between cancer genes and drug targets is expected to contribute to patient-tailored therapies with few side effects.

Loss of BRCA1 in cells is associated with profound chromosomal instability and a high rate of spontaneous chromosome breakage. We are investigating the role played by BRCA1 in the repair of DNA damage and how specific defects in the function of this protein lead to the profound genomic instability that is prerequisite for the development of breast cancer. Using the powerful genetics of the chicken DT40 system, as well as an in vitro assay for biochemical function, we are investigating the role of BRCA1/BARD1 in mediating the cellular response to DNA damage. In particular we are attempting to relate the E3 ubiquitin ligase and BRCT phospho-protein binding functions of BRCA1 to its role in the maintenance of genomic stability. A proportion of this work focuses on a functional relationship between BRCA1 and the Fanconi anaemia pathway for repair of blocked replication forks. Recently this work uncovered a new human disease gene, the Fanconi anaemia complementation group J gene (FA-J). Understanding the function of FA-J is another clear goal of the group. |An additional area of research is the role of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like molecules on cellular function. To this end we are investigating the role of SUMO modification on DNA repair and collaborate with Neil Brockdorffs group (MRC, Hammersmith) investigating the mechanism of the polycomb-mediated histone ubiquitination implicated in gene silencing and epigenetic programming. The latter involves the expression, purification and characterization of novel E3 ligase activities associated with members of the human and mouse polycomb complex.|	Medical Research Council	Unit	None	None

I will tackle this question using an integrated computational and experimental approach with the T helper cell system as my model. The Th system consists of a naïve precursor cell type, and four main differentiated cell types that have some capacity to interconvert, known as plasticity. The experiments will be designed to measure both entire transcriptomes and single mRNAs by single molecule RNA-FISH. (i) Quantifying genetic switches. On a genome-wide scale, what is the distribution of gene expression levels in the Th cell types? Do genes have two discrete expression levels (on and off) in terms of mRNAs per cell or a continuous distribution of expression levels? How do epigenetic marks correlate with expression levels? We will use genome-wide RNA-seq and epigenetic ChIP-seq experiments on homogeneous populations of cells coupled with new computational methods. (ii) The molecular nature of the genetic switch. What is the hierarchy and kinetics of molecular events that drive gene expression changes during differentiation and plasticity? Using highly resolved timecourse experiments to profile individual cell generations, we will unravel the temporal order of regulation by transcription factors, microRNAs and epigenetic factors using RNA-seq and ChIP-seq experiments. We will integrate the data computationally to infer new regulatory interactions.(iii) How genetic switches drive cell type switches. Which transcription factors directly regulate cytokines, the phenotypic readout of Th cells? Are the kinetics of these interactions graded or switch-like? What is the extent of stochastic cell-to-cell variation? We will validate predicted transcription factor-cytokine interactions and quantify levels of proteins and mRNA in single cells with fluorescence microscopy experiments, modelling this data probabilistically.

We have previously shown that adult neural stem cells induce the expression of Ascl1 when they become activated and that Ascl1 function is essential for stem cells to exit quiescence and proliferate. Our collaborators have shown that ischemia induces Ascl1 expression in a population of astrocytes restricted to the striatum. However, only a subset of these Ascl1-expressing astrocytes initiates a neurogenic programme. Here we will use cultures of neural stem cell and astrocyte as well as conditional mutant mice to characterize the signaling pathways that induce Ascl1 expression in activated neural stem cells and activated striatal astrocytes. This will help us understand why Ascl1 is not expressed more broadly by astrocytes in ischemic brains. We will also characterise the gene expression programme activated by Ascl1 in neurogenic astrocytes and we will study the signaling, transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms responsible for the resistance of non-neurogenic astrocytes to Ascl1 function. This project will shed new light on two important steps in the activation of neurogenic programmes in the adult brain, the induction of Ascl1 expression and the stimulation by Ascl1 of cell proliferation and neurogenesis. Identifying the pathways that control these two steps in striatal astrocytes will help us decipher mechanisms that limit the neurogenic potential of adult brain astrocytes. In the longer term, our findings will help design strategies that overcome these limitations and stimulate more broadly Ascl1 expression and its activity in astrocytes in response to injury.

CD4+ T lymphocytes can differentiate to functionally distinct subsets and classified based on their cytokine secretion profiles as well as other properties. Proper regulation and balance between various lymphocyte subsets is central for the appropriate function of the immune system and required e.g. for host defence against pathogens or cancer as well as protection from autoimmune diseases. Recently, a new effector CD4+ T cell subset Th17 was discovered and named according to the main cytokine they secrete, IL17. Besides being involved in host defence to extracellular pathogens, Th17 cells play a central role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases in human and experimental mouse models. The recent discovery by the Stockinger group links the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, a transcription factor widely studied in the toxicology field, and the Th17 system, which provides new hypotheses on the potential mechanisms underlying the well-established connection between the environmental factors and autoimmune diseases. The cellular response to an external stimulus is mediated through a series of overlapping networks that include the signalling network, the epigenetic and transcription factor control mechanisms at genome level, and the gene regulatory. In this project we will study these control mechanisms during the differentiation of Th17 cells by combining genome-wide experimental and computational approaches. We expect that our project results in the identification of the key regulatory components of each of the networks involved, as well as provide insights into the nature of molecular interactions between them. Such regulatory hubs, or the pathways that they participate in, provide targets for rational chemotherapy either for the immune-mediated diseases described above, or for enhancing protective immunity against infectious agents.

This activity, histone H3K4 methylation, is part of the epigenetic regulatory network that sets the program for gene activation and is particularly critical during the early stages of development. Aberrant epigenetic signalling is linked to disease and mutations that lead to disruption of MLL1 have been specifically associated with aggressive childhood leukaemia. Our preliminary characterisation of the complex indicates that the complex substituent proteins WDR5, RbBP5 Ash2L and Dpy30 act cooperatively to stimulate the activity by inducing a conformational change in the MLL1 SET domain. By combining techniques in biochemistry, biophysics, electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography we will determine the molecular details of this activation process. A critical advance in our preliminary work that underpins this proposal has been the successful purification of the intact mammalian complex co-expressed in insect cells. Our initial characterisation of this purified recombinant complex has confirmed that the components are stoichiometric, the complex is active, behaves well in biophysical analysis and is suitable for EM studies. We are now seeking funding to take these studies further in order to describe the subunit contacts that stimulate methyltransferase activity. We will locate the position of the protein subunits within the molecular envelope defined by EM studies, identify the key events that lead to optimal activity and optimise the recombinant constructs in order to produce a high resolution X-Ray structure. Ultimately this work will provide mechanistic insights into the regulation of one of the major epigenetic activators of gene transcription. In addition to moving forward the molecular epigenetic field we believe that this work can be the foundation for future inhibitor studies that target regulatory protein:protein interactions.

Disruption of this regulation is a major cause of disease including cancer, autoimmune disease and metabolic disorders. The overall aim of the group is to study the mechanisms that regulate gene expression during development with a particular focus on how cell cycle regulators integrate with external signals and intracellular factors in the control of transcriptional initiation and elongation. We have identified several important regulatory pathways that are regulated by the Aurora B kinase. Aurora B is an epigenetic regulator that phosphorylates histone H3 serine 10 and serine 28 in mitosis and during development, and also phosphorylates multiple proteins that are involved in regulating different stages of the cell cycle. We are using mouse models to investigate roles for Aurora B in regulating multiple cellular functions. These include regulating protein ubiquitination during embryonic stem cell differentiation, the functioning of the polycomb proteins in positive and negative regulation of gene expression, and the activity of transcription factors and co-factors that control B lymphocyte activation. We use the study of cell cycle kinase functions in gene regulation as a paradigm for understanding how regulation of the cell cycle has been co-opted during evolution to integrate cell proliferation with developmental processes and to control developmental transitions. We are also investigating how dysregulation of these processes contributes to tumourigenesis and cancer progression.	Medical Research Council	Unit	None	None

In particular, we will investigate restrictive and permissive chromatin changes in animal models that mimic pathologic features of Parkinson's disease, prion disease and tauopathies. Chromatin changes and ensuing transcriptional alterations will be analysed over time prior to, during and after the development of pathology (e.g., protein aggregation and neurodegeneration). Bioinformatic analysis will help identify similarities as well as differences across disease models and elucidate metabolic/toxic pathways involved in cell-specific vulnerability. Our present lack of disease-modifying intervention for human neurodegenerative diseases is due to a limited knowledge of pathogenetic mechanisms. Although chromatin remodelling could be one of these mechanisms, it remains relatively unexplored from the experimental and translational standpoints. This proposed study is designed to provide key insights into the dynamic nature of neurodegenerative diseaseassociated chromatin alterations and will constitute the seed for further work aimed at targeting these epigenetic modifications as a novel therapeutic approach.

Remarkably, driver mutations of the histone H3.3 variant and its loading machinery have been recently found in paediatric glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a devastating neoplasm originating from transformed neural precursors. Thus, the very basic building blocks of chromatin can be mutated in cancer. The present challenge is to define at which level altered H3.3 loading influences GBM pathogenesis and provide clues into the underlying mechanisms. Based on work from our group and others, we hypothesise that alterations of H3.3 function/deposition would lead to epigenetic changes, deregulated transcription at bivalent loci and other genomic regions, and alterations of telomere maintenance mechanisms, in turn contributing to tumourigenesis. The main objectives of this proposal are to: 1. Examine the impact of H3.3 mutations on brain cancer pathogenesis, by determining the effect of mutant H3.3 expression on neural precursor cell transformation (A), and tumour maintenance (B). 2. Define the molecular changes caused by incorporation of H3.3 mutants into the genome and their involvement in tumourigenesis, by A. determining the genome-wide distribution of WT and mutant H3.3 proteins, B. identifying mutant H3.3-driven transcriptional and epigenetic changes, C. defining effects on telomere maintenance mechanisms, and D. connecting mutant H3.3-driven molecular changes to the biological phenotypes. The discovery of mutations in histones and their loading machinery represents a paradigm change in the field of cancer epigenetics. We anticipate this study to provide key insights into the role of these alterations in chromatin regulation and cancer pathogenesis. More broadly, this work will increase our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms governing chromatin modification in mammalian cells.	European Research Council	Consolidator Grant	1999998.0	EUR

Epigenetic reprogramming caused by IDH1 and IDH2 mutations have been implicated previously in brain and cartilaginous tumours. Recently, driver mutations in the histone 3.3 (H3.3) variant have been identified in over 50% of paediatric glioblastoma multiforme cases and we have also found that these mutations are found in ~60% of conventional central and dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas: the mutations in both these brain and bone tumours lead to modifications of the epigenetic landscape. The identification of direct alterations of the basic building blocks of chromatin represents a paradigm shift in our understanding of cancer epigenetics. Very recently, we have also reported that H3.3 variants are mutated in primary central bone (H3F3A in 92% of giant cell tumours and H3F3B in 95% of chondroblastoma), thus suggesting that direct alterations of histones are more common than previously thought. Several questions remain unanswered: are histone mutations transforming? In which cell type(s) and at which developmental/differentiation stage(s) do the mutations exert their transforming potential? What are the molecular changes caused by deposition of mutant histones? Do H3.3 mutations work in part through a non-cell autonomous mechanism? This proposal will address these questions. In particular, we aim to determine the biological and molecular consequences of bone/cartilage tumour-associated H3.3 mutations. Furthermore, we have set out how we will correlate the epigenetic and transcriptome changes imposed by H3.3 mutations across the different tumour types (bone and brain). Overall, this study will contribute to explaining the mechanisms by which the H3.3 mutations bring about the disease phenotypes. Our finding will provide opportunities for developing targeted therapies, which may be valuable for treating more than one tumour type.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	464091.0	GBP

Transcriptional profiles are directed by the chromatin landscape and 3D structure (‘architecture’), which is affected by the presence of specific combinations and concentrations of transcription factors. The SFB consortium proposes to examine general principles that underlie switches in transcription profiles, such as those that occur in normal and aberrant development, in the reaction to infection and in carcinogenesis. Using JAKSTAT signalling as a paradigm, we propose to test the following key hypotheses. Transcription factors represent indispensable elements in regulating chromatin shape, i.e. they are either pioneer factors in chromatin remodelling and modification, or readers of epigenetic information deposited by other transcription factors. In particular, we hypothesize that homeostatic and dynamic (‘acute stressed’) and constrained (‘chronically stressed’, mutated/cancerous) cellular programmes critically depend on the status of JAKSTAT signalling. Key transcription factors act in concert with different repertoires of associated factors to exert functions that are strictly context-dependent. For STATs and JAKs, we hypothesize that STATs have JAK-dependent and -independent functions and vice versa. We propose that the availability of STATs, their isoforms and their interaction partners determine their role as inducers of chromatin modification or as classical transcription factors. The work will be pursued in haematopoietic cells in the context of STAT1/3/5 and TYK2 activities in immune responses (‘acute/chronic’ stressed landscapes) or malignant transformation (‘constrained’, mutated landscapes). The central aim is to determine at which hierarchical levels JAK-STAT influences cell and organismic homeostasis as well as disease. The expertise of the consortium members ranges from immunity, haematopoietic malignancies and epigenetics to bioinformatics. The SFB has the critical mass to develop and exploit next-generation methodologies, including assays for genome-wide 3D chromatin interactions, chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation states and ChIP-Seq (if necessary combined with mass spectrometry) and deep NGS for various classes of RNA. ‘Disease-tailored’ mouse models and genome editing will be used to translate the findings to disease. Animal experimentation will be approved by an Ethics committee and the national authorities and will strictly follow the 3R principles. The SFB would be hosted by the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna with the participating institutions CeMM Austrian Academy of Sciences, MFPL University of Vienna, Medical University of Vienna and Ludwig Boltzmann Society. The SFB would build on Vienna’s longstanding reputation in the field of JAK-STAT signalling (www.jak-stat.at), extending its scope to address key issues in chromatin function. The results will pave the way for novel therapeutic possibilities, especially with regard to personalized medicine.	Austrian Science Fund FWF	Special Research Programmes SFB	1598520.0	EUR

The disease arises as a result of an accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations that endow the cells with malignant properties including uncontrolled proliferation and metastasis. Cooperation of oncogenic signals activated by cancer mutations and/or epigenetic changes in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are key etiologic events in cancer. The identification and detailed molecular understanding of signal interactions in cancer, particularly of those amenable to drug targeting, is pivotal to the establishment of rationale-based combination treatments to overcome or at least ameliorate major problems in oncology such as limited therapeutic efficacy, development of drug resistance, severe side effects and disease relapse. In this proposal, we will investigate a novel synergistic oncogenic signal interaction recently discovered in our lab involving cooperation of the Hedgehog and Interleukin-6 pathway. Using a combination of genetic mouse models, cell biology and molecular approaches, we will address the therapeutic relevance of HH-IL6 signal cooperation in basal cell carcinoma (BCC), a very frequent non-melanoma skin cancer caused by aberrant activation of Hh/Gli signaling. In addition, we will decipher the molecular details of HH-IL6 signal integration and identify the critical HH-IL6 targets responsible for the determination of the malignant phenotype induced by synergistic Hh-Il6 signaling. The detailed analysis of HH-IL6 signal cooperation proposed in this application will provide new insights into the intricate regulatory mechanisms of oncogenic HH/GLI signaling and shed light on the molecular effectors controlled by HH-IL6 cooperation. This will eventually help defining novel rational combination treatments relying on combined inhibition of HH-IL6 signaling and critical downstream effectors.

The histones in the nucleosomal core are highly conserved proteins, with several variants that can carry specific post-translational modifications. Nucleosome position and composition are important elements of epigenetic information that, together with the genomic DNA, can be inherited during somatic and sexual propagation. DNA sequence information is copied faithfully during replication and hence represents the most conservative layer of inheritance. In contrast, arrangement, composition, and modification of the nucleosomes can vary during growth, or between tissues and individual cells, thereby affecting gene expression patterns and contributing substantially to differentiation and development. Besides these programmed changes at nucleosomes, recent data from one partner lab have shown that in plants, also extended exposure to high temperature can cause extensive and global dissociation of nucleosomes from DNA, connected with transcriptional activation of otherwise silent genes and transposons. Although these gene expression changes are transient, they result in a lasting effect on the organization of heterochromatin in nuclei of differentiated leaf cells. Reassembly of nucleosomes requires the chromatin assembly factor (CAF) complex, a well-conserved histone H3-H4 chaperone. In the context of the proposed project, we want to build on this work and investigate the molecular processes occurring during nucleosome dis- and re-association and the nature of the persistent effects on nuclear chromatin organization. To this end, we will focus in particular on the role of histone H3-H4 chaperones in the removal of old and supply of new histones as well as on the dynamics and chromatin enrichment of different H3 variants. Further, we want to investigate the extent to which the heat stress-induced changes also affect meristematic tissue. This is an important question as environmentally induced epigenetic changes are presumed to affect subsequent generations, but evidence on the molecular level is lacking. We will combine one team’s expertise in the molecular biology of histone variants, histone chaperones, and cytological analysis of nuclear organization with the know-how of the partner lab in stress application, analysis of global transcription, and nucleosome occupancy. The project is expected to provide insight into the mechanism of an interesting and so far underinvestigated layer of epigenetic control and into the potential impact of adverse environmental conditions on inheritance. The project leaders have an established record of fruitful collaboration and will involve several young scientists in this work, for whom the research is an excellent training platform in a scientifically stimulating and well-equipped academic surrounding.

A few years ago, several groups identified PRDM9 as a key player in hotspot activity, but so far the function of PRDM9 is still enigmatic. PRDM9 is an epigenetic modifier which binds DNA via its Zn fingers and targets double strand breaks necessary for the initiation of recombination in its vicinity. Specific DNA motifs recognized by PRDM9 are a key factor in determining hotspots, yet there are many cases in which motifs are neither necessary nor sufficient to determine a hotspot, and in many instances the motifs are found more often outside than within hotspots. We clearly do not fully understand the binding determinants of PRDM9 to DNA, and sequence motifs do not capture all the aspects of the binding site information. With more information about binding characteristics of PRDM9 and the biochemical characterization of PRDM9 binding, some of the incongruous and bizarre observations about PRDM9 could be better addressed. The aim of this proposal is to characterize PRDM9 binding in several human hotspots with and without the Myers motif. Specifically, we will analyze 1) the binding kinetics of human PRDM9 (variant A) to sequences of representative human hotspots; 2) the factors that influence the binding affinity and specificity, and 3) if reduced fertility is associated with allelic differences in PRDM9. In order to address these aims, we propose to characterize hotspots using sperm typing techniques and combine standard in vitro binding methods such as electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) with microscale thermophoresis (MST), a highly quantitative biophysical approach that can accurately measure binding affinities (dissociation constant; KD) in unpurified substrates. With this project we can elucidate for the first time the components of PRDM9 binding and what features influence PRDM9 specificity and determine the regions targeted for meiotic recombination.

Current guidelines recommend a step-up approach to treatment, whereby first-line therapy must fail before second-line agents are considered. Patients with more aggressive disease therefore wait longer to receive effective therapy. Many patients have inadequate response to all available medications, leaving them at risk of progressive liver disease. PBC is therefore a major cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality. There is a critical need in PBC for novel agents, and for simple, robust approaches (especially biomarkers) for early risk and treatment stratification, so that medications may be allocated at diagnosis based on the patient's predicted need for treatment and his or her likelihood of response. This is the essence of precision medicine. UK-PBC is an ambitious collaboration between Academia, Industry and the NHS to develop precision medicine for PBC. In the proposed project, building on previous success, we will expand the existing, unique UK-PBC Research Cohort to more than 10,000 participants; collect maximal clinical data about participants from diverse NHS sources; and use these data to develop accurate clinical prediction models of treatment response and disease progression, suitable for risk and treatment stratification in clinical practice. We will undertake genotype-phenotype analysis to delineate the genetic basis of this phenotypic variation, and develop genetic risk scores and predictive models incorporating clinical and genetic variables. Finally, we will undertake epigenetic and transcriptional profiling of PBMC subsets from an inception cohort of treatment naïve patients to discover epigenetic and transcriptional biomarkers for risk and treatment stratification. Via integrated analysis of genetic, epigenetic and transcriptional datasets, we will pinpoint causal variants, genes and pathways to guide re-purposing of drugs.

We have set up a transgenic mouse facility to provide model systems to study this process and have demonstrated that even large pieces of the human a globin gene cluster inserted into mice are incompletely regulated. The major enhancer of human a globin gene expression has been identified by analysis of natural mutations and its mouse equivalent has also been identified. However, deletion of the mouse enhancer by knockout technology results in a much milder disease than its human counterpart, demonstrating that regulation of the mouse and human clusters have evolved separate mechanisms and that the mouse is not a good model for the human system. In order to overcome these problems we have helped develop (in conjunction with colleagues in Edinburgh) a technique in which the a globin gene region of the mouse has been excised and replaced with the equivalent region of the human cluster. This technique involves chromosome engineering in mouse ES cells and modification of a human BAC to produce mice humanised for a large region (>100 kb) around the a globin cluster. We have also produced humanised mice lacking the human enhancer element and demonstrated that they faithfully recapitulate the human disease. These mice will be used to purify erythroid cell populations at different stages of differentiation and maturation to analyse globin gene expression, chromatin structure, epigenetic modifications and other important facets of gene regulation. The findings will be compared with normal primary human erythroblasts produced from peripheral blood by a two stage culture system. The humanised mouse system is iterative, allowing successive modifications to the human BAC to be introduced into the ES cells and allow the generation of new mouse models. For instance, we plan to examine the orientation dependence of the major regulatory element in its natural location and determine the effects of moving the element to other positions both inside and outside the a globin gene cluster. This research project is at the basic end of the spectrum but the information obtained should be of benefit in designing future treatments of diseases such as the thalassaemias and sickle cell disease, particularly in terms of gene therapy.

The model we have established focuses on the most telomeric two megabase (Mb) region extending from the terminal repeats of human chromosome 16 and including the human alpha globin cluster. Our plan is to fully characterise this chromosomal region and to relate long-range, primary DNA sequence to chromosome structure and the key processes of nuclear metabolism. This work will provide a broad perspective from which to interpret how the globin genes are regulated from their normal chromosomal environment. In addition, we will continue to identify and characterise chromosomal rearrangements affecting this region, allowing us to study the mechanisms underlying these mutations and the relationship between monosomy for chromosome 16 short arm and human genetic disease.||We plan to fully annotate the DNA sequence, identify all of the genes in this 2 Mb region, establish their patterns of expression, and, as far as possible, their normal function in vivo, and their roles in human genetic disease. To date we have identified 120 genes and pseudogenes within the 2 Mb region. We will update the annotation of the genes, and determine their patterns of expression in different tissues throughout development. A key step in taking this programme forward will involve the development of a microarray representing all the genes in this area. In addition, the microarray will be used to characterise new deletions from chromosome 16; preliminary data from the analysis of some well-characterised deletions suggest that this will be feasible (Drs S. Knight and J. Flint, IMM). Finally we will use the array in combination with chromatin immunoprecipitation to identify the proteins associated with this region of the chromosome, and assess how they may relate to function. The 16p microarrays will be made in collaboration with Dr A. Greenfield, MRC Harwell.||In addition to understanding the function of individual genes we plan to determine whether there may be general principles relating genome structure to function. We will examine the organisation of this 2Mb region in the nucleus, and determine the relationship between chromosome structure, nuclear position and the key processes of replication, transcription, methylation and chromatin modification. Having a complete contig across this 2Mb region, we will use three-dimensional confocal analysis to establish the normal position of this telomeric region within the chromosome 16 territory and with respect to subnuclear structures such as the nuclear envelope, heterochromatin, nucleoli, PML bodies, coiled bodies, in a variety of cell lines and primary cells. Once established we will address how this is altered when the region is disrupted, and also how it may alter with changes in gene expression.||In collaboration with Prof B. Turner, we have been analysing the pattern of histone acetylation around the alpha globin genes using chromatin immunoprecipitation. This work will be extended to include the entire 2 Mb region and should allow us to relate these patterns to the other aspects of chromosome function that we are pursuing. We have examined the pattern of replication timing across this region and whilst most of the region replicates early, we have identified a 300kb region which appears to replicate late in S phase. The presence of a late replicating region within a region of euchromatin suggests it could represent the border of a structural and/or functional chromosomal domain. We plan to investigate this hypothesis further using immuno-FISH and chromatin immunoprecipitation to define which proteins may associate with this region.||Building on these findings, we will continue to identify and characterise chromosome rearrangements in this region, and examine their underlying mechanisms, their influence on chromosome function and their effects on phenotype.||To identify the genes which have a significant i	Medical Research Council	Unit	None	None

Over 100 imprinted genes are known, and many of these are also imprinted in humans. Defects in imprinted genes or the imprinting process can result in diseases which frequently involve abnormalities in growth and development before and after birth, and play a role in metabolic disease in adults, and cancers as well.||Imprinting is controlled by cis-acting regulatory regions that are differentially marked during gametogenesis. However the mechanism whereby imprinted gene expression is established and maintained is only partially understood. We selected an imprinted region on mouse chromosome 2 for in depth investigation and identified a complex of imprinted genes, the Gnas cluster. The orthologous cluster GNAS in humans has a similar organisation, and is associated with several inherited disorders. An intricate system of regulatory controls has evolved to maintain the parental specific expression of genes within the cluster. Imprinted expression at the Gnas cluster is controlled by two germline differentially methylated regions. The Gnas cluster is exceptional in having two such regions. Using targeted deletions we have shown that one of the regions, regulates the imprinted expression of one gene in the cluster and the other affects expression of all the genes in the cluster, and is the major element controlling imprinting in the cluster. Our recent work has shown that noncoding RNA originating in the major element plays a key role in the process. Other recent work indicates that a correct balance of gene products in the cluster is required for normal growth and survival.||The availability of mouse models has helped in the understanding of imprinting syndromes in humans. Of the 18 imprinting phenotypes so far discovered, all but one can be attributed to Harwell research and the imprinting map of the mouse has been exclusively developed and refined here over a number of years.

Identifying markers associated with later disease risk early in life would allow us to identify and target interventions to those most at risk. Studies in rodents suggest that epigenetic factors may be one mechanism underpinning such ?programmed' effects. Our findings in a human population suggest the early life environment, at least in terms of maternal diet, alters DNA methylation in association with body composition in adulthood.

Human and animal studies suggest programming effects are not limited to the first generation but may be transmissible to subsequent generations through both male and female lines. The mechanisms accounting for the intergenerational transmission of programmed effects are unclear. We have developed a rat model of fetal glucocorticoid overexposure in which the offspring have reduced birthweight and as adults have hypertension and hyperglycaemia, a phenotype which is transmitted to a second generation. Alterations in epigenetic modifications have been described in animal models of programming and in humans and the transmission of epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation (5mC), histone modifications and small RNAs through the germline may be one mechanism accounting for the transmission of programmed effects. We propose there may also be a key role for a newly described DNA modification 5-hydroxymethylation (5hmC). In this project we will test the hypotheses that programming effects are transmitted to a second generation as a consequence of (a) altered epigenetic reprogramming during gametogenesis and/or (b) altered epigenetic modifications in mature germ cells. This research will increase knowledge and understanding of the role which epigenetic modifications may play in the early life origins of disease and will explore the mechanisms which might account for the transmission of such effects to a second generation, providing a basis for the inherited association between low birthweight and cardiovascular risk factors. Ultimately, this study may suggest methods that would allow the early identification of individuals at risk of later disease, potential interventions to decrease this risk and interventions to prevent the transmission of disease risk across generations.

This study will combine world-leading expertise in infection and immunity, a population based birth cohort study and computational analysis to identify novel mechanisms related to increased susceptibility to asthma, allergies and RTIs. We will harness the power of systems biology to the rich clinical, immunological, genetic and environmental data sets, in hundreds of subjects, either already available in the Manchester Allergy and Asthma Study birth cohort, or in new datasets collected as part of this proposal to generate: - complete clinical follow up and sampling of the cohort from birth to adulthood at 18yrs - next generation sequencing of targeted relevant immune genes - complex functional characterisation of immune responses to viral and bacterial infections, gene methylation studies and component resolved allergy diagnostics in blood collected in childhood (8yrs), early (11yrs) and late (14yrs) puberty and adulthood (18yrs) Using a flexible probabilistic framework, we will extrapolate knowledge from generated/existing data and formulate new hypotheses that will lead to functional experiments testing these hypotheses in in vitro and in vivo models.

We will elucidate the development of functional antiviral and anti-bacterial immune responses and of epigenetic marks from childhood to adulthood and their relation to susceptibility to asthma, allergies and RTIs, and to underlying genetic polymorphisms.

Despite good prognosis in pediatric patient outcome, at least 15% of patients will suffer from relapse. Hence, a deep understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of this disease is needed to improve current therapeutic approaches. For instance, genome-wide analyses of genetic alterations in B cell leukemia identified the transcription factor PAX5 as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor in one third of all B-ALL cases. Less is known about the role of PAX5 translocations and rearrangements, which generate novel chimeric PAX5 transcription factors in a smaller subset of B-ALL. The PAX5-JAK2 rearrangement creates a fusion protein that consists of the N- terminal DNA-binding paired domain of PAX5 linked to the C-terminal kinase domain of JAK2. The PAX5-JAK2 rearrangement is likely a dual-hit mutation as it inactivates one PAX5 allele and leads to the expression of a constitutively active JAK2 kinase that could activate the JAK- STAT signaling pathway. Moreover, JAK2 can act as an epigenetic regulator by phosphorylating tyrosine 41 on histone H3 (H3Y41ph), which functions as an active histone mark to stimulate gene expression. To investigate the role of PAX5-JAK2 in leukemia development, we have generated a mouse model expressing the PAX5-JAK2 protein from the endogenous Pax5 locus. Pax5JAK2/+ mice rapidly develop an aggressive B-ALL tumor without the need of an additional cooperating mutation, which thus confirms the dual-hit hypothesis. Having established a mouse tumor model for PAX5-JAK2, we will investigate to what degree PAX5-JAK2 contributes to B- ALL development through activation of canonical JAK-STAT signaling and/or the non-canonical epigenetic pathway. We will identify and characterize PAX5-JAK2-regulated target genes by genome-wide transcriptome, PAX5-JAK2 binding and chromatin profiling analyses of Pax5JAK2/+ B-ALL tumors. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutagenesis will then be used to define the functional relevance of the top-ranked target genes for leukemia development. By analyzing the expression profile of human PAX5-JAK2+ B-ALLs, we will determine the degree to which the critical PAX5-JAK2 target genes identified in mouse Pax5JAK2/+ B-ALL tumors are also deregulated in the human disease. Collectively, these data will provide novel important insight into the molecular mechanisms, by which the oncoprotein PAX5-JAK2 induces B cell leukemia, and may suggest improved therapeutic approaches for the treatment of this B-ALL subtype.

The hypothesis is that: - The risk is causal, dose dependent and interplay with maternal psycho-social factors; - The risk is mediated and/or modulated by the glycaemic load and/or the inflammatory score of the diet; - The risk is causally associated with the regulation of genes in the major metabolic tissues (i.e. liver, skeletal muscles, adipose tissues); - There are causal pathways linking the alteration of MGR loci and glycaemic health in the offspring, part of which is mediated through early growth. PREcisE project harnesses very large data prospectively collected from Spain, Germany, Finland, France and The Netherlands, including randomised control trial and combines with long lasting collaboration with the pregnancy and childhood (PACE), the early growth (EGG) and recent Global MethQTL consortia, to establish the mother-to-offspring transmission of glycaemic health through robust epigenetic factors. The consortium will reach sufficient power to perform its research through the use of data and biological atlas collected prospectively by its PIs.

Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a lethal autosomal recessively inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a GAA repeat expansion mutation within intron 1 of the FXN gene. Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications have now been identified by us and others as part of the disease mechanism in FRDA. We have also recently established GAA repeat expansion-based FRDA transgenic mouse models, which exhibit an FRDA-like disease phenotype. We now aim to investigate the cellu lar specificity of FRDA molecular disease mechanisms by isolating neural stem cells (NSCs) from our GAA repeat expansion FRDA mice (containing different repeat sizes and degrees of instability) and differentiating these NSCs into neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. Skin fibroblasts will also be isolated from the same mice as a source of non-neural cells. We will then characterise the FXN molecular profiles of each cell type and investigate the consequences of GAA repeat instability on FRDA molecular disease mechanisms and the progressive nature of FRDA disease within neural and non-neural cells. Furthermore, we will investigate potential novel FRDA therapies using our newly established cell culture systems, which will provide valuable information for future FRDA clinical studies.

Tumor progression requires multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations in tumor cells. Cells that acquire only a single activated oncogene, such as K-Ras, frequently enter an irreversible proliferation arrest, called senescence. Oncogene-induced senescence is an important tumor suppression process, through its ability to arrest tumor progression at an early stage. Tumor progression is also influenced by growth factors in the tumor cell's extracellular microenvironment. We will investigate the molecular basis of oncogene-induced senescence, its antagonism by proliferation-promoting Wnt signals originating in the cell's microenvironment and how these two competing factors play out to determine tumor progression in vivo. Project 1. Investigate the regulation of expressed genes in senescent cells. Many senescent cells accumulate domains of facultative heterochromatin, called senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF). SAHF are thought to silence expression of proliferation-promoting genes. However, many genes are still expressed in senescent cells. We will investigate the hypothesis that expression of these genes is maintained through their exclusion from SAHF. Project 2. Investigate how Wnt-signaling activity is repressed in senescent cells. The canonical Wnt-signaling pathway is activated by extracellular Wnt ligands, and maintains proliferation of many mammalian cell types. Activated Ras oncogenes (e.g. RasV12G) trigger cell senescence, in part, through repression of the canonical Wnt-signaling pathway. Expression of the Wnt ligand, Wnt2, is repressed early in the senescence program. We will define the specific molecular mechanism by which activated Ras represses expression of Wnt2. Project 3. Investigate how elevated Wnt-signaling activity suppresses oncogene-induced senescence. Elevated extracellular canonical Wnt ligands delay oncogene-induced senescence. We will investigate the hypothesis that exogenous Wnt ligands delay senescence through multiple mechanisms, likely including direct suppression of the pRB and p53 pathways. Project 4. Investigate whether extracellular Wnt-signaling drives melanoma progression by delaying oncogene-induced senescence. Although activation of canonical Wnt-signaling is thought to contribute to melanoma formation, genetic mutations in this pathway are rare in this cancer. We will investigate the hypothesis that non-cell-autonomous activation of Wnt-signaling in melanocytes, achieved through paracrine interactions between melanocytes and keratinocytes, suppresses oncogene-induced senescence, thereby driving progression towards malignant melanoma. Project 5. Investigate whether Wnt-signaling drives colon cancer progression by delaying oncogene-induced senescence. Canonical Wnt-signaling is invariably activated in human colon cancer cells due to genetic mutations. We will investigate the hypothesis that activation of Wnt-signaling promotes transformation of normal colonic epithelial cells, in part, by delaying oncogene-induced senescence.

Oncogene-induced cellular senescence (OIS) is a permanent cell growth arrest caused by an activated oncogene in a primary untransformed cell. OIS is a potent tumor suppression mechanism. Senescence depends on profound changes in chromatin structure. Two chromatin regulatory complexes implicated in control of senescence are the HIRA/UBN1/CABIN1/ASF1a (HUCA) histone chaperone complex and the Brg1/Snf5 chromatin-remodeling complex. HUCA is a histone chaperone that deposits the histone variant, histone H3.3, at transcription start sites and other gene regulatory sites. Since histone H3.3-containing nucleosomes are unstable, this promotes transcription activation. The Brg1/Snf5 complex reshapes chromatin in an ATP-dependent manner, and this also frequently results in transcription activation. Consistent with a role in senescence, the Brg1/Snf5 complex has potent tumor suppressor activity in humans and mouse models. However, the relationship between HUCA and Brg1/Snf5 as regulators of gene transcription and senescence is unknown. Recently, through unbiased, whole-genome ChIP coupled to massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) we discovered a striking overlap between HUCA and Brg1/Snf5 across the human genome. Accordingly, we hypothesize that Brg1/Snf5 and HUCA are intimately associated as regulators of chromatin structure and function. In particular, we hypothesize that HUCA and Brg1/Snf5 collaborate to regulate the onset of cell senescence. We will test this hypothesis as follows: Aim 1. Compare physical and functional overlap of HUCA and Brg1/Snf5 complexes in proliferating and senescent cells. Aim 2. Investigate physical and mechanistic interactions between HUCA and Brg1/Snf5 in vitro. Aim 3. Investigate functional and mechanistic interactions between HUCA and Brg1/Snf5 in vivo.

Cancer is driven by the acquisition of mutations which result in the loss and gain of cell functions and genomic instability. We hypothesise that the spectrum, distribution and impact of genetic abnormalities is different between children and adults. Aims:We will exploit the knowledge gained from investigating the relationship between the cancer genome, the clinical phenotype and the response to therapy; to change clinical practice and improve outcome for adults with ALL. Methods:We will use state-of-the-art integrated genomic profiling to (1) determine the key genetic and epigenetic pathways disrupted in cases without a known primary chromosomal abnormality and (2) investigate the clonal origins of relapse and study patterns of genomic instability at relapse. This will identify novel genetic and epigenetic lesions as well as disrupted pathways which will be used to define new subgroups, track disease progression and develop novel therapeutic strategies. To perform a systematic genomic interrogation of known genetic lesions causally implicated in ALL pathogenesis, we will design a targeted re-sequencing assay for a comprehensive panel of ~150 genes. This will enable a systematic and detailed evaluation of the genetic landscape identifying critical gene-gene and gene-phenotype associations. Response to therapy is a major predictor of outcome in ALL but current methodologies have limitations in adults. Tracking oncogenic driver mutations using ultra-deep sequencing offers a novel approach for monitoring minimal residual disease. We will assess novel ultra-deep sequencing technologies, compare them to the gold standard methodology and determine prognostic value using longitudinal sample collections. The recent success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in treating BCR-ABL1 leukaemia illustrates the clinical utility of targeted therapies. We will use an established preclinical xenograft model to evaluate candidate drugs which target novel and existing genetically altered pathways; thereby informing future drug repurposing and development. We will achieve our objectives utilising data and samples from 2000 adults with ALL and treated on two ongoing CRUK funded trials (UKALL14, UKALL60+) and a closed trial (UKALLXII). How the results of this research will be used:The output of this research will create a unique resource which will be used to developrisk models which integrate demographic, genetic and response data and can be used to further stratify patients to treatment pathways which reduce toxicity and improve outcome.

We will use a mouse model, where offspring prenatally exposed to a high fat nutritional environment develop the metabolic syndrome phenotype in adulthood following post-weaning high- fat feeding. We are suggesting that a maternal diet during pregnancy that is high in fat can adversely affect the development of the offspring's circadian clock system in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and in peripheral tissues, resulting in altered rhythmic expression and function of clock and clock-controlled genes involved in the regulation of adipogenesis, metabolism and cardiovascular function. If these offspring are subsequently fed the same high fat diet, their physiology will be unable to respond appropriately making them particularly susceptible to developing metabolic To address our aim we will look at circadian metabolic, hormonal and activity patterns in mouse offspring from high fat fed dams and examine the effects of a post-weaning high fat feeding. We will then measure the 24h mRNA expression pattern of clock and clock-controlled genes, and other 'candidate' genes linked to both circadian and metabolic/cardiovascular/adipocyte function in neonate and adult offspring SCN and peripheral tissues which are key organelles to the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome. We will also examine whether an epigenetic mechanism, i.e. modification of rhythmic histone acetylation of clock- associated genes and RNA polymerase binding, is involved in the aberration and phase-shift in the circadian timing system and maladapted responses to a post-weaning high fat diet. Our proposed study will provide the scientific basis for understanding how an unhealthy diet in early life contributes to metabolic syndrome later in life. Results from this study will have direct relevance to humans.	Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council	Standard grant	297008.0	GBP

Gene haploinsufficiency is a genetic disease mechanism by which the loss of one gene copy leads to disease. Why one copy of the some genes should be insufficient is unknown. Furthermore, it is common that diseases due to gene haploinsufficiency have a highly variable clinical presentation, with some individuals being very severely affected and others only mildly affected. This is obviously problematic for clinicians because the diagnosis of the disease offers little insight as to its likely outcome. Even identical twins may have different clinical problems. This tells us that non-genetic factors contribute to the variability. What are they? One category is "epigenetic" factors, these are factors, often proteins, that affect the activation of a gene but not its basic structure (DNA). The DNA in a cell has to be highly packaged in order to fit in the cell nucleus. Packaged DNA is called chromatin. When a gene needs to be activated (expressed) it is often necessary to loosen the packaging to allow access to proteins that activate gene expression (transcription factors). There are many proteins involved in changing the conformation of chromatin (chromatin modifiers) so as to expose or hide genes from transcription factors. In this way chromatin modifiers ensure that a gene will be activation at the right time and in the right place. In this study we will investigate how a known disease gene and transcription factor, Tbx1, interacts with chromatin and chromatin modifiers. Understanding this may be key to understanding how and why the loss of one copy of Tbx1 results causes a genetic disease with a variable clinical outcome. If chromatin modifiers are indeed important to the disease process, one can imagine that drugs targeting them may improve clinical outcome. We will test this in mouse models of a genetic disease.

Based on its residual activity, there are several degrees of severity. In particular, in severe HA patients, spontaneous bleeding episodes frequently occur without any clear cause. Standard therapies are ineffective in preventing the bleedings, therefore arthropathy development remains one of the main complications in the management of HA patients. The impairment of vessel stability in HA is not understood and the impact of this defect related to the absence or low activity of FVIII as never been explored. Our studies show that, in severe HA patients, the endothelium (EC) is more permeable and less functional than healthy controls, suggesting a role of FVIII in vessel stability. The EC fragility was attenuated after transduction of HA-ECs with a lentiviral vector (LV) expressing FVIII, suggesting its extra-coagulative role in enhancing vessel stability. Therefore, to elucidate the extra-coagulative role of FVIII, we will engineer healthy EC to generate mutated cells and analyze gene expression, epigenetic status and protein secretion profile in HA and healthy ECs. These cells will be corrected using LV expressing FVIII under the control of the naïve promoter. Finally, we will investigate whether restored FVIII can improve vessel stability in addition to the bleeding defect in a HA mouse models. Therefore, the study of the extra-coagulative role of FVIII can offer new strategies for the management of HA patients and can pave the way for the development of combined cell and gene therapy strategies for a more efficient treatment of HA.

Our goal is to characterize the molecular pathogenesis of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) in order to develop possible therapeutic approaches.FSHD is the third most important myopathy.Currently, no therapeutic treatment is available for FSHD.Unlike the majority of genetic diseases, FSHD is not caused by mutation in a protein-coding gene. Instead, FSHD is the result of a complex epigenetic cascade activated by deletion of a 3.3 kb subtelomeric non-coding repeat (D4Z4) located on chromosome 4q35.D4Z4 appears to be required for maintaining proper chromatin structure at 4q35 and its deletion causes de-repression of several 4q35 genes.Recently, we found that FSHD is caused by over-expression of the 4q35 gene FRG1 and we generated the first animal model of the disease.Our specific aims are:1. To elucidate the mechanism underlying control of gene expression at 4q35.Our preliminary results suggest that non-coding RNAs and micro-RNAs generated by D4Z4 regulate chromatin structure and 4q35 genes expression. Our analysis will generate novel insights into the biological role of repetitive DNA sequences in higher eukaryotes.2. To identify the pathways affected by FRG1 over-expression.We have recently found that FRG1 over-expression causes aberrant alternative splicing of selective genes. Using splicing-sensitive microarrays we will identify FRG1-dependent alternatively spliced transcripts and validate them using the FSHD mouse model. Our studies will elucidate the role of alternative splicing in the pathogenesis and will identify targets for therapeutic purposes.3. To search for a possible therapy for FSHD.Based on our finding, we propose independent strategies aimed at controlling FRG1 activity to interfere with the progression of muscular dystrophy.In summary, our studies will provide relevant information to understand the molecular basis of FSHD and will help the development of effective therapeutic strategies.

Unlike the majority of hereditary diseases, FSHD is not caused by a genetic defect in a gene encoding for a protein. Instead, the disease is associated to the reduction of the number of copies of DNA, called D4Z4, which are repeated many times towards the end of the long arm of chromosome 4. Despite years of intensive research the pathogenesis of FSHD remains largely unknown. For this reason, there is no treatment or cure for the disease. The objective of this research project is to understand the molecular mechanism of FSHD. We recently identified DBE-T, a non protein-coding RNA that is produced preferentially in FSHD patients. Although our results indicate that DBE-T is required to trigger the cascade of events leading to FSHD, its mechanism of action is poorly understood. With this project, we aim to characterize the activity of DBE-T and evaluate its relevance as a therapeutic target. We strongly believe that, by studying the regulation and mechanism of action of DBE-T, we will be able to develop complementary therapeutic approaches for the treatment of FSHD.

WBS patients display unique behavioral and cognitive profile: a mild intellectual disability with severely compromised visuo-spatial processing, and comparatively well preserved linguistic abilities, anxiety and hyper-sociality. Conversely, the duplication of the same genes gives rise to a condition termed 7q11.23 microduplication Autistic Spectrum Disorder (7dupASD) syndrome, whose patients still have facial dismorphisms, while they display opposite cognitive features: severe language impairments and hindered socialization.

Among them, GTF2I and BAZ1B, that regulate gene expression, have already been pointed out as responsible for some intellectual disabilities and/or facial features alterations.

The polycomb complex, bmiPRC1, has been shown to mono-ubiquitylate histone H2A lysine 119, playing a key role in epigenetic gene regulation. Mammalian cells have a number of Bmi1 paralogues, including Mel-18, all of which form a unique PRC1-like complex. I have recently identified a novel PRC1-like complex melPRC1. Phosphorylation of Mel-18 within the melPRC1 complex is required for the correct spatial positioning of the ubiquitin ligase machinery to specifically ubiquitylate H2A lysine 119. The key objectives of this proposal are to identify regulators of Mel-18 phosphorylation and determine how phosphorylation imparts specificity of the E3 ligase activity. The requirement of phosphorylation of Mel-18 for nucleosome recognition and the correct spatial positioning of the E3 ubiquitin machinery will be examined using recombinant components in vitro. Key regulators involved in Mel-18 phosphorylation will be identified through biochemical approaches. The function of these key regulato rs in the dynamics of Mel-18 phosphorylation will be investigated in different cellular contexts. In addition, I propose to identify and characterise novel PRC1-like complexes. This proposal will provide novel insight into the link between cellular signalling pathways and melPRC1 complexes, which results in transcriptional repression via specific histone modification.

As a consequence, this disorder is transmitted as an X-linked trait by carrier mothers to their affected sons. Females can also be affected, but not as severely as males. The mutation that typically causes FXS consists of the expansion of a repetitive sequence of CGGs (Cytosine-Guanine-Guanine) in the promoter region of the FMR1 gene. This structural change triggers a further modification of the DNA (methylation) and of histones (methylation and deacetylation), the proteins on which the DNA is wound. This so-called epigenetic modification is the actual cause of the inactivation of FMR1 , in spite of the fact that its coding sequence is intact. One could say that the gene, like a lamp, is simply switched off, not broken. In a series of previous experiments we were able to switch the gene back on in an in vitro system, using drugs that remove DNA methylation (5-azadeoxycytidine; valproic acid) and restore histone acetylation (sodium butyrate). Now we plan to elucidate other mechanisms that regulate the activity of FMR1 , in the first place a phenomenon called RNA interference. It was recently shown by other authors that small fragments of RNA (a molecule that is copied from DNA and is very similar to it) can regulate gene activity. We intend to study RNA interference not only as a regulatory mechanism of FMR1 , but also of other genes, called methyltransferases, that cause DNA methylation and therefore contribute to the inactivation of FMR1 . At the same time, with the help of powerful new technologies that measure the activity of several thousands of genes simultaneously, we shall analyse all those genes whose expression is different in FXS cells, compared to normal cells. Elucidation of this intricate network of interactions promises to open new avenues towards the cure of FXS.	Telethon Italy	Grant General Project	139000.0	EUR

This implies a complete comprehension of how cell identity is acquired and maintained during development and differentiation. The Polycomb-group (PcG) and trithorax-group (trxG) genes encode for evolutionary conserved chromosomal proteins that control cell identity. In Drosophila, PcG and trxG proteins are part of a "cellular memory" mechanism acting on specialized DNA elements (PREs) that fix determined states on developmentally regulated genes and convey epigenetic inheritance. However, to date the mechanism(s) by which PcG act in the chromosome, remain elusive. In particular, no PREs have been identified in mammals yet. The goal of this project is the establishment of a novel model system to study the PcG and trxG function in mammalian cells. In particular, I would like to use the human and mouse neural stem cells (NSCs). NSCs have been shown to have a generalized potential in adopting any cell fate. Thus, beyond their tremendous therapeutic potential, they provide an ideal and intriguing model system to study the role chromosomal components and specialized DNA elements in the regulation of cell identity during differentiation. In addition, the completion of genome sequencing projects has suddendly provided the possibility to evaluate the role of all genes at a global level. In particular, the microarray and biochips technologies allow the simultaneous analysis of thousands of genes. Here, in order to identify all PcG and trxG target genes, I propose a novel approach combining an in vivo chromatin technique for the identification of target sites of chromosomal proteins with biochips.

BWS is genetically heterogeneous and shows extremely variable clinical phenotype. The molecular data available suggest that BWS and possibly other related overgrowth disorders are caused by deregulation of genes located on chromosome 11p15.5 and characterised by genomic imprinting. This is a mechanism causing the expression of a gene to depend on its origin from mother or father. This process is controlled by epigenetic modifications, that are heritable characteristics of a gene (such as DNA methylation) not coded by its nucleotide sequence. The most frequent molecular abnormalities in BWS are indeed DNA methylation defects. However, their identification is still incomplete and the molecular pathogenesis of BWS is undefined. In this project, we propose to use animal models to define the regulatory mechanisms of the BWS genes and use these informations to identify the molecular defects and give insights into the pathogenesis of this disease.

From the translation of these messenger RNAs depends the erasement of parental genomes imprinting and the onset of embryonic genome reprogramming that will allow the acquisition of the totipotency typical of a stem cell to the first blastomeres of the developing embryo. We aim to isolate and identify the messenger RNAs regulated by Sam68, a RNA-binding protein that is regulated by a sperm factor released into the oocyte at fertilization. The study of translation into proteins of the RNAs regulated by Sam68 at the onset of embryogenesis may shed light on novel pathways involved in the epigenetic and structural modifications that allow the acquisition of totipotency to the embryonic genome. These experiments will be useful to create the knowledge required to manipulate stem cells in vitro in order to appropriately guide their differentiation potential. Moreover, given the involvement of aberrant genetic reprogramming at the onset of embryogenesis in some neurodegenerative diseases, our studies may identify novel target for the therapeutical approach to such diseases.

Epigenetic processes regulate gene transcription states during cellular differentiation, playing key roles in the maintenance of pluripotency and differentiation. Epigenetic alterations are common in diseases such as in cancer and cognitive disorders. Understanding the mechanisms by which epigenetic states are inherited and propagated is of fundamental importance, and will help in the development of biomarkers for screening as well identification of targets for disease treatment.DNA methylation remains the best-characterized epigenetic process. XX pluripotent stem cells (Embryonic Stem (ES) and induced Pluripotent Stem (iPS) cells) display genome-wide hypomethylation relative to XY stem cells but the mechanisms are unknown. This proposal will elucidate the pathways responsible. Irradiation Microcell-Mediated Chromosome Transfer (XMMCT) will be used to identify the critical region(s) of the X chromosome involved. In parallel and as an alternative approach, candidate X-linked genes will be over-expressed in XY ES cells to identify the factors responsible for global hypomethylation. Further insight will be provided using protein interaction screens using epitope-tagged versions of all active Dnmts as well as the known regulators URHF1 and Dnmt3L in XX and XY ES cells. The role of XX-induced hypomethylation in cellular reprogramming will be investigated by using different cell types from Oct4-GFP transgenic mice to examine whether iPS efficiency is affected by cells with a greater propensity to lose DNA methylation. Together these aims will elucidate the signals necessary to maintain global genomic DNA methylation. Aberrant loss is an important hallmark and contributor of disease that could be used for disease diagnosis and treatment. It could also be exploited to help improve the efficiency of cellular reprogramming for regenerative medicine.	European Research Council	Starting Grant	1497710.0	EUR

Genes are like our blueprint - they determine everything that our cells do. Cancer is caused by changes to either the structure or activity of key genes that regulate how cells operate, divide and die. While every cell has a copy of every gene, any given type of cell needs only some of the genes to be active. So, when a cell divides to produce two new cells, it not only has to copy all of its genetic information and then give one complete and properly functioning set of genes to each of the two new cells, the new cells also have to remember which genes were turned on and which were turned off. With a grant from AICR Dr Sale is investigating a gene called REV1 which, if missing or damaged, alters how cells copy their DNA in such a way that cells forget, as they divide, which genes were on and which were off. This type of cellular memory loss is seen in many cancers and understanding how it happens is important for understanding how cancer develops and how it can be treated.

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are increasingly recognised as important targets for the treatment of cancer and other diseases including Alzheimer's. They are essential enzymes required for human development & homeostasis. HDACs 1-3 serve as the catalytic subunits in several large transcriptional co-repressor complexes that are recruited to chromatin by repressive transcription factors. These complexes function by removing acetyl groups from histones resulting in condensation of chromatin and gen e silencing. Our research is concerned with elucidating the fundamental mechanisms through which HDACs 1-3 are regulated and how they target chromatin. Our recent structure of the HDAC3 co-repressor complex identified the small signalling molecule inositol tetraphosphate (IP4) as an essential co-factor (Nature 2012, 481, 335). The breakthrough realisation that IP4 acts as an epigenetic regulator suggests a completely new and unexpected mechanism for the regulation of gene repression. More rece ntly still, we have determined the structure of HDAC1 bound to the Metastases Associated Protein co-repressor (unpublished). This structure not only reveals the basis for the specific assembly of HDACs into their cognate complexes, but also reveals how the complex is targeted to chromatin. We propose to address the major outstanding questions concerning the biological role and mechanisms of action of histone deacetylase complexes: (i) to determine the structures of the four HDAC1 and HDAC3 hol o-complexes, defining the specificity of assembly and their role in determining target gene and substrate specificity (ii) to understand the biological role of IP4 in regulating HDAC complexes (iii) to explore potential therapeutic targeting of HDAC:co-repressor complexes by both small molecules and interfering peptides	Wellcome Trust	Investigator Award in Science	2391777.0	GBP

Over the last few years, significant research efforts have been focussed on analysing the signalling, transcriptional and epigenetic landscape of pluripotent stem cells, as well as unravelling the molecular changes that underpin the initiation of differentiation. In contrast to this, very little is understood about how pluripotent cells adapt their organelle activity to the new environments they face during the onset of differentiation. Of specific interest, given their fundamental role in determining the cells apoptotic response and metabolic output are mitochondria. We have found that at the onset of differentiation, pluripotent stem cells dramatically change their mitochondrial morphology and dynamics, and that accompanying these changes they modify their response to cell death stimuli and metabolism. Here we will investigate in both mouse, and humans, using a combination of stem cell and embryological approaches, the links between these events. In the first place we will study in detail the precise changes that occur in mitochondrial morphology and dynamics as cells exit the pluripotent state. We will then manipulate mitochondrial dynamics and study how this affects the metabolism of pluripotent stem cells, their ability to respond to cell death stimuli, and their developmental potential. Finally, we will exploit the significant knowledge of the signalling pathways that maintain pluripotency and that drive differentiation, to identify novel signalling inputs that regulate mitochondrial dynamics and function in stem cells. Together, these experiments will provide a unique insight into an essential, but understudied aspect of early embryonic development, the dynamics of the mitochondria, as well as addressing how they impact on the process of differentiation.

To unveil the mechanisms by which programs of gene expression are established during differentiation represents a key challenge towards the development of stem cell therapies and differentiation protocols into specific cellular lineages. Recent work has shown that important cohorts of developmental regulator genes are silent in ESCs but primed for activation upon differentiation. We and others have shown that the poised state reflects an equilibrium between Polycomb silencing by histone modification and the presence of poised RNAPII complexes, which elongate through coding regions, but lack Ser2 phosphorylation which uncouples transcription from downstream RNA processing events such as RNA splicing and polyadenylation. Poised RNAPII have not yet been identified in lineage-committed cells, but are likely to occurs since Polycomb silencing is essential during development. The molecular mechanisms that regulate the poised state of RNAPII at developmental regulator genes in ESCs are still unknown. The aims of this proposal are to: 1) investigate dynamic changes in RNAPII phosphorylation during neuronal commitment of ESCs in neural stem cells and post-mitotic neurons, and 2) to address the mechanisms of RNAPII poising regulated by the modulators of RNAPII activity in ESC pluripotency, using a combination of ChIP, siRNA, and transcriptome analyses. The Systems Approach proposed to integrate epigenetic and expression data obtained here during neuronal commitment and upon interference with the regulatory networks that control RNAPII activity in ESCs will provide important insights about the chromatin priming mechanisms that are active in ESCs. The accomplishment of these objectives will clarify important transcriptional mechanisms of outstanding interest in the biology of pluripotent cells and in the basic mechanisms of gene regulation.

However, the impact of the epigenetic landscape in breast cancer development and prognosis is poorly understood. We propose to test whether we can target particular histone modifications that are frequently lost in breast cancer using a synthetic lethality approach. Further, we will test whether we can improve targeting using a combination of novel drugs together with approved DNA–damaging agents. Lastly, we will identify genetic determinants underlying alterations of particular histone marks to facilitate biomarker development. We anticipate that the ability to target such epigenetic alterations will have an important impact on breast cancer treatment and will be of significant clinical interest.

Over half of heart failure patients die of arrhythmic death, which claims about 100,000 lives a year in the UK. Current anti-arrhythmic agents are designed to block ion channel activity, which can cause pro-arrhythmic effects, culminating in greater overall mortality risk. We recently discovered a novel mechanism underlying gene regulation of a set of potassium (K+) channels (Kv4.2, KChIP2, Kv1.5, ERG1 and Kir6.2) through a signalling complex comprised of mitogen-activated kinase kinase 7 (MKK7), histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and Krϋppel-like factor 4 (KLF4). With this grant application, we propose to investigate the MKK7/HDAC2/KLF4 mechanism on how it links stress signalling pathways with repression of cardiac K+ channels and susceptibility to arrhythmias. Specially we will explore the effect of HDAC2 inhibition by Valproic acid (VPA) on restoring K+ activity and reducing arrhythmic propensity in an MKK7-knockout arrhythmic mouse model and in human induced pluripotent stem cells derived-cardiomyocytes (iPS-CMs). Information generated will provide important evidence supporting a new therapeutic concept by targeting signalling regulators rather than ion channels as an effective and safe anti-arrhythmic treatment option.

Epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between low birthweight and an increased prevalence of cardio-metabolic disorders. Evidence suggests that this phenomenon of ‘fetal programming‘ is not limited to the first generation. In our model, antenatal dexamethasone administration is associated with reduced birthweight, increased expression of the gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and adult hyperglycaemia. Additionally, we have shown that prenatal dexamethasone exposure has intergenerational effects on birthweight, PEPCK and glucose tolerance. The persistence of such effects in a second generation, transmitted by both maternal and paternal lines indicates the likely importance of epigenetic factors in the intergenerational inheritance of the ‘programming phenotype‘. The object of the proposed research is to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms through which a brief exposure to glucocorticoids can alter gene expression and how this phenotype is transmitted to the offspring. We hypothesise that glucocorticoids mediate these effects epigenetically by modifying chromatin structure in a heritable manner. We propose to test this hypothesis by delineating the epigenetic effects of prenatal dexamethasone exposure and to identify key genes that may be altered in this model. We plan to examine global differences in DNA methylation following exposure to dexamethasone in utero, using techniques that support the identification of target genes contributing to the programmed phenotype. Additionally we will study the effects of agents known to alter histone acetylation patterns on the dexamethasone-programmed phenotype. We will then explore whether the transgenerational inheritance of such epigenetic modifications explains the transmission of the programmed phenotype to subsequent generations, by extending this study into a second generation to explore the inheritance of these epigenetic effects. This research will increase knowd understanding of the role which epigenetic modifications may play in the early life origins of disease and whether epigenetic modification might represent a mechanism by which the environment might modulate the genetic predisposition to disease in human populations. Additionally, this study will demonstrate whether these effects are heritable and therefore provide a basis for the inherited association between low birthweight and cardiovascular risk factors. In the long-term, we plan to extend this research into the mechanisms underpinning the intergenerational inheritance of disease risk in humans. Ultimately, this study may suggest methods that would allow the early identification of individuals at risk of later disease and potential interventions to decrease this risk.

Recent advances have led to the identification of several autism-associated genes. This proposal will examine the neurodevelopmental role of two of these genes, the chromatin-remodelling factors CHD7 and CHD8. CHD7 is mutated in CHARGE syndrome, which is a syndromic form of autism. We have recently produced new mouse models that reveal key functions of CHD7 in the development of the cerebellum, a part of the brain that is consistently reported to show neuro-anatomical defects in autistic patients. We will use these mouse models to test important questions about the relationship between the genetic control of cerebellar development and autism. First, we will determine the developmental and epigenetic mechanisms that underlie these cerebellar defects. Second, we will use mouse models in which CHD7 is specifically deleted from the developing cerebellum to test to what extent cerebellar defects are responsible for some of the behavioural features characteristic of autism; a critical question remaining in the field. We will build on this model to explore the significant association of CHD8 haploinsufficiency with non-syndromic autism. CHD7 and CHD8 proteins directly interact and our preliminary studies suggest that CHD8 and CHD7 might regulate similar pathways during cerebellar development. To define the mechanisms whereby CHD8 deficiency causes autism, we will identify the functions of CHD8 in brain development and determine the behavioural consequences of CHD8 deletion from the developing cerebellum. Together, these studies will identify new epigenetic mechanisms that can cause cerebellar defects and determine the consequences of cerebellar hypoplasia, in the absence of primary defects in the neocortex, on behaviours characteristic of autism.

A fundamental problem in cancer research is the identification of the cell type capable of initiating and sustaining the growth of the neoplastic clone in vivo. The key to solving this problem lies on the observation made over 40 years ago that tumours are heterogeneous and thus might be maintained only by a rare subset of cells called ?cancer stem cells? (CSCs). However, the proof of this principle was only possible after the development of modern research tools for investigating the behaviour of defined cell populations in vivo. The blood-related cancer leukaemia was the first disease where human leukaemic initiating cells (LICs), were isolated. The development of quantitative xenotransplantation assays using immune-deficient mouse recipients to detect primitive human HSCs with in vivo repopulating ability and the adaptation of this model to leukaemia has been instrumental. Leukaemia can now be viewed as aberrant haematopoietic processes initiated by rare LICs that have maintained or reacquired the capacity for indefinite proliferation through accumulated mutations and/or epigenetic changes. Yet, despite their critical importance, much remains to be learned about the developmental origin of LIC and the mechanisms responsible for their emergence in the course of the disease. Over the years our laboratory has been involved in better defining human normal HSCs and LICs compartments. During the last 6 years, we have identified new heterogeneity in both normal and LICs compartment. We have established new tools to study LICs ex vivo, to examine the interaction of LICs and HSCs with their niche and to monitor the development of leukaemia in vivo using whole body imaging. We have also deciphered the role of beta catenin in the maintenance of LICs as well as the role of CEBPa mutations in normal HSC development. We have prospectively isolated and identified a population of murine mesenchymal stem cells and contributed to the understanding of the ageing of murine and human HSCs.

However, most patients, will acquire platinum resistance and eventually succumb to their disease. SCOTROC 4 is a phase III, randomised trial which aims to determine if intra-patient dose escalation of carboplatin improves outcome over flat dosing. The translational project proposed here is a comprehensive, prospective molecular profiling approach (including transcription, genome copy number and methylation profiling platforms) applied to primary tumour material and matched pre and post platinum resistance ascites samples within the SCOTROC4 trial. Although clinico-pathologically homogenous, the dominant ovarian subgroup of FIGO stage III, grade 213, serous adenocarcinoma displays marked heterogeneity in response, progression free- and overall- survival. By focussing on this subgroup, treated homogeneously with single agent platinum, we will maximise the power of the study and identify important molecular subdivisions of this group. There are three specific hypotheses we wish to examine: 1) That a patient's response to carboplatin can be predicted by the genetic, epigenetic and transcriptional profiles of the primary tumour prior to chemotherapy. 2) That isogenic sequential sampling of ascites at presentation and relapse can identify molecular signatures of platinum resistance, and indicate potential therapeutic targets to modulate this resistance. 3) That molecular comparisons of intrinsic and acquired platinum resistance can reveal if the mechanisms are the same or different. These studies represent the most comprehensive approach to identifying the clinically relevant mechanisms of platinum resistance to date, and include novel approaches in data fusion of multiple genome-wide nucleic acid profiling technologies.

This initiates cell cycle checkpoints, activates apoptosis and is involved in MRN-mediated double-strand break (DSB) repair. We have recently shown by immunohistochemistry that low MRE11 expression is associated with poorer survival following radical radiotherapy for bladder cancer than high expression. Failure of cell cycle arrest/apoptosis responses may result in radioresistance and reduced local tumour control. A novel finding in bladder cancer, reduced MRE11 protein expression could arise due to MRE11 gene mutations, epigenetic MRE11 silencing by promotor hypermethylation and/or loss of heterozygosity at 11q21. Relevance to cancer Bladder cancer is the 5th commonest cancer in the UK and surgical removal of the bladder and radiotherapy give equivalent outcomes, despite their underlying mechanisms being very different. Radiotherapy delivers ionising radiation to tumours and DSB are the lethal lesions. Further understanding of the role of DNA damage signalling in response to ionising radiation would assist in targeting of treatment specifically to tumours thus increasing the therapeutic ratio. Specific aims 1. to examine the effect of reduced MRE11 expression in bladder tumour cell lines in terms of impact on cell cycle checkpoint activation, apoptosis and DNA repair. 2. to establish the MRE11 promoter methylation status in 15 bladder cancer cell lines, and the effect of MRE11 gene reactivation by demethylation and/or gene reintroduction in those with hypermethylation. 3. to look for MRE11 poly(T)11 repeat mutations and study MRE11 promoter methylation status in 93 bladder tumours. (Loss of heterozygosity will be investigated in a parallel project). Outline plan of research MRE11 will be downregulated by retrovirally introducing short hairpin (sh)RNAs into the RT112 bladder cancer cell line. Effects on NBS1/RAD50 protein expression will be assessed by western blotting, and DNA repair by the in vitro non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and I-SceI (NHEJ and homologous recombination) assays. NBS1 shall be knocked down for similar experiments. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) shall be used to establish the promoter hypermethylation status of MRE11 in 15 bladder tumour cell lines, six of which have losses at 11q21, and, if identified, cells will be treated with demethylating agent to reactivate silenced genes or MRE11 reintroduced into the cells and the effect on arrest and apoptosis assessed. In 93 bladder tumours from radiotherapy patients we shall sequence DNA for the poly(T) mutation in MRE11 intron 4 and establish promoter methylation status by MSP in MRE11, NBS1, RAD50 and ATM.

We have previously shown that alterations in chromatin precede the onset of gene expression and also the stable formation of transcription factor complexes. We hypothesized that transcription factors transiently bind to their recognition sequences and leave a remodelled chromatin structure behind. In the work described here we wish to use an in vitro differentiation system based on mouse ES cells to gain insights into the earliest events of epigenetic priming of individual genes. We will initially concentrate on two genes, Pu.1 and c-fms which are part of a transcriptional hierarchy. We aim to identify the earliest factors binding to these genes. We will also manipulate the levels of a transcription factor known to regulate the timing of onset of expression of both genes (Runx1) and directly measure the effect of such manipulation on Pu.1 and c-fms chromatin structure. In addition, we plan to use a novel technique (Dam-fusion proteins) to map short-lived interactions of Runx1 with its target genes and correlate this with alterations in chromatin. Last, but not least, we plan to use this technique to identify new target genes for Runx1 and another important transcription factor, Smad1. These target loci themselves will be subject to further mechanistic studies in the future. We regard this joint proposal as a powerful alliance between two laboratories with highly relevant complementary expertise. Our combined expertise of ES cell engineering, sophisticated ES cell culture and chromatin fine structure analyses techniques provides us with a unique opportunity to probe deep into the molecular details of how haemopoietic development is initiated.

In normal tissue 5hmC is a stable epigenetic mark associated with active gene expression. Recently 'Loss of 5hmC' has emerged as a hallmark of many primary cancers, an early detection and potential cancer staging tool. The TETs are exceptionally responsive to metabolic stimuli and this opens up several avenues for therapeutic intervention. However, the therapeutic potential seems to be cancer-specific, since unexpectedly, in some cancers, (e.g. prostate cancer), metastasis and recurrence are associated with increased levels of 5hmC and poor survival. We have preliminary data that suggest that this may also be the case for CRC. In this project we are using a combination of bioinformatics, mouse models and a unique series of CRC model cell lines in an organoid culture system to discover the causal relationship between 5hmC levels, the tumour phenotype and metastatic transformation in CRC. We propose to test two models for 5hmC function. The first model proposes that changes in 5hmC mediate oncogenic splice switching to drive cancer progression. The second model proposes that 5hmC levels regulate the stem-like phenotype of cancer cells. These models are not mutually exclusive. The outcome of this research will inform how 5hmC contributes to the cancer phenotype and whether it is a viable therapeutic target. Although the focus is on the role of 5hmC, an additional outcome of this project will be to further elucidate the catalytic function of TET enzymes in cancer progression.

The population prevalence of affected males is approximately 1 in 4000, and that of carrier females, at risk of having affected children, 1 in 250 or more. The syndrome is caused by a mutation of the FMR1 gene localized on the X chromosome. The mutation consists in an amplification and methylation of a DNA sequence within the promoter of the gene. This change blocks the expression of the gene, preventing the production of the FMRP protein, in spite of the fact that the coding sequence of the gene is intact. One might say that the gene is not broken; it is just switched off. We showed previously that the mutant gene can be switched back on by treating in vitro cell lines from fragile X syndrome patients with drugs that can remove the methylation from the DNA and thus relieve the block of the promoter. We also showed that regulation of the FMR1 gene activity depends not only on DNA methylation but also on epigenetic (reversible) structural changes occurring on the histones, i.e. those proteins on which the DNA double helix is wound. With the present project we intend to study in more detail the mechanisms that regulate the expression of the FMR1 gene, by: a) investigating in induced pluripotent stem cells (similar to embryonic stem cells) the factors that during development trigger those epigenetic changes that block the activity of the FMR1 gene; b) analyzing the role of small RNA molecules known to regulate gene expression; c) analyzing the effect of new drugs potentially capable of restoring the activity of the FMR1 gene. Our ultimate goal is to transfer in vivo the results obtained in vitro, hoping that this may lead to the discovery of an effective cure of the syndrome.

The cause of this devastating condition is believed to be mutations in a gene called Mecp2. One of the most debilitating symptoms od RTT is represented by severe epilepsy, which is often resistant to common therapies. Using a RTT mouse model it has been demonstrated that neurons are not irreversibly damaged and symptoms might therefore be cured. These studies demonstrate that a better understanding of the pathophysiologic processes leading to RTT might help developing therapeutic strategies. Notably, splicing events occur mainly in the central nervous system and participate in setting threshold of neuronal excitability together with fundamental neuronal processes, from cell-related ones, such as nerve growth and synapse formation to higher cognitive functions, including learning and memory. Although promising, this area is still poorly investigated in the RTT research field. In this framework is placed our research program. We identified a new MeCP2 downstream target whose splicing is markedly altered in RTT mouse models. This target is a protein involved in epigenetic regulation of transcription and its function is fundamental for neuronal maturation and synaptogenesis, and to modulate neuronal excitability, processes impaired in RTT. With our proposal we intend to test the possibility to ameliorate RTT symptoms in particular epilepsy, using short DNA molecules named antisense oligonucleotides that can interfere with the pathological splicing processes.

However, our tissues contain many different cell types: neurons, liver cells, and others. Our cells differ because they have certain sets of genes that are "turned on", as well as others that are "turned off". Recently, scientists have identified "epigenetic factors" - distinct from the DNA sequence - that can switch genes on or off. Epigenetic factors regulate gene expression and when altered are responsible for pathological conditions. Indeed, many human genetic diseases are caused by epigenetic alterations. Unlike DNA sequence mutations, epigenetic changes are ideal target for gene therapy because they are by nature reversible. Stem cells are a special tissue, highly regulated at the epigenetic level, with the potential to generate any cell type. Stem cells regenerative potential makes them ideal reagents for treating many human genetic diseases. Remarkably, the stem cells of the model organism D.melanogaster are currently among the best-understood adult stem cells. Interestingly, during tissue regeneration after injury, well differentiated cells can also be converted into a new multipotent state with distinct epigenetic modifications. Interestingly, Drosophila imaginal discs, the precursors of the adult Fly appendages, are also a unique system for studying epigenetic plasticity occurring during regeneration. The possibility of manipulating the epigenetic pathways of pluripotent cells is of the highest interest for the applications in cell therapy and regenerative medicine and conceptually alternative to gene replacement. However, a mandatory step to get closer to potential epigenetic therapeutic strategies is to gain a full knowledge of the molecular events underlying epigenetic reprogramming. Thus, I propose to use a variety of biochemical and genetic approaches to unveil the epigenetic mechanisms involved in stem cell identity and cell fate switch using the model organism D.melanogaster.

Enzymes that modify the methylation status of histones have been shown to be involved in regulating several transcription factors and display aberrant expression in cancer, implicating a role for these proteins in tumour progression. Research teams from the Northern Institute for Cancer Research (NICR), Newcastle University and the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR), Sutton, Surrey, have identified specific histone modifying enzymes as potentially druggable therapeutic targets in specific types of cancer (breast, rhabdomyosarcoma). However, the current level of target validation is not yet sufficient to warrant the investment required for a full drug discovery project at the CR-UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit at the ICR. This project builds on an evolving collaboration between these two research centres and the unmet clinical need for more effective, less toxic treatment for patients and aims to fully validate specific products of genes encoding histone modifying enzymes as therapeutic targets in cancer.

In addition to the roles of E-cadherin in cell architecture and migration, the protein also appears to mediate signalling through EGFR and the Wnt pathway (Jeanes et al., Oncogene 2008). Lobular cancers are typically ER and PgR positive and HER2 negative (Bertucci et al., Oncogene 2008), and hormonal therapy is the mainstay of treatment for advanced lobular breast cancer before chemotherapy is necessary after the development of resistance. Lobular breast cancers respond less well to chemotherapy than ductal carcinomas (Cristofanilli et al., J Clin Oncol 2005), therefore there is a real need to develop new agents for patients with disease progression despite prior hormonal therapy. There are currently no recruiting studies worldwide investigating novel therapies specifically for advanced lobular breast cancer patients. Aims: This two stage phase II translational trial has been designed to evaluate whether crizotinib has activity in advanced lobular breast cancer that has progressed on prior endocrine therapy, aiming to confirm the activity seen in prior pre-clinical studies. The primary endpoint is confirmed response rate of the combination of crizotinib and fulvestrant, with the combination proposed to ensure concurrent blockade of ER signalling and to maximise potential for tumour control. A metastatic biopsy will be required for all patients for sequencing, with optional biopsies at day 15 and disease progression. Each cycle, blood will be collected for ctDNA analysis. This will allow us to identify candidate biomarkers of sensitivity and resistance.	Breast Cancer Now	Clinical Catalyst	None	None

The Wnt pathway is an evolutionarily conserved determinant of tissue and organismal development and homeostasis. Several reports have shown that inherited genetic polymorphisms that result in reduced Wnt signaling are associated with accelerated onset of aging phenotypes such as heart disease, metabolic syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis and diabetes. These genetic data imply that elevated Wnt signaling might delay the aging process. Replicative cellular senescence was discovered and first described as an irreversible growth arrest triggered by the accumulation of a discrete number of cell divisions. Replicative senescence is likely to be of great importance for our understanding of the biology of ageing. Yet other studies have implicated changes in chromatin structure in the regulation of cellular senescence. For example, normal mammalian tissue ageing is associated with changes in chromatin structure. Thus, cellular senescence, Wnt signaling and epigenetic/chromatin changes are all implicated in the aging process, but the relationships between them are far from clear. Recently, the UK Lead Investigator, Peter D. Adams, has recently discovered that reduction of Wnt signaling triggers the formation of heterochromatin and senescence in vitro. Meanwhile, John M. Sedivy has discovered that many of the changes associated with senescence-associated heterochromatin formation in vitro are detectable in ageing tissues in vivo. Based on these results, we have hypothesized the existence of a Wnt- Chromatin-Senescence signaling pathway as a major determinant of the rate of aging. This application investigates this hypothesis through three Specific Aims."	Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council	Small Grants	471847.0	GBP

Background Bowel cancer screening will change how rectal cancer presents in the UK. Pilot studies demonstrate that half of screen-detected cancers are early (pT1-2,N0M0). Local excision, with radical salvage therapy in the event of recurrence, could be safer and functionally superior to conventional radical surgery. A predictive biomarker indicating ‘high risk‘ of recurrence following local excision could be used to optimise patient selection and so reduce the requirement for late salvage. We hypothesise that ‘high risk‘ tumours can be identified at a molecular level using epigenetic signatures. Our aim is to develop a panel of functional methylation biomarkers that can discriminate ‘high‘ from ‘low risk‘ early rectal tumours. Our preliminary studies have identified 30 candidate biomarkers. We now wish to select a panel of five for validation in two large patient populations. METHODS A) Selection of methylation biomarker 1) Evaluation of gene expression using real-time RT-PCR and selective IHC Only those candidate markers exhibiting differential expression in node-negative and node-positive rectal tumours will be selected for subsequent analysis. 2) Validation of methylation using Pyrosequencing We shall confirm the presence of discriminatory methylation values at the candidate sites in node-positive and node-negative rectal tumours using Pyrosequencing. B) Mechanisms of epigenetic gene silencing We hypothesise that the ‘high risk‘ phenotype is mediated by a particular epigenetic silencing mechanism. Examination of the histone modifications at silenced loci will identify the dominant pathway. Markers involved in these mechanisms will be determined by IHC (DNMT, SIRT1) and carrier chromatin immunoprecipitation (H3K27me3, H3K27me3). C) Validation of biomarkers The panel of biomarkers derived from Stage A and B will be evaluated in: (a) A large cohort of locally excised rectal tumours where outcome i.e. recurrence is knowned early rectal tumours to determine whether the prevalence of high risk markers is significantly different in early stage symptomatic and screen detected tumours. (C) Colonic tumours using tissue microarray immunohistochemistry, supervised by Prof. P Quirke, Leeds FUTURE STUDIES The ability of the methylation-based biomarkers to inform clinical decision-making will be prospectively evaluated in the Cancer Research UK funded multicentre randomised phase II trial of radical surgery versus short course pre-operative radiotherapy and delayed local excision (TREC) which will launch in 2010.

These complex networks consist of transcription factors, which are largely conserved across animal phyla, and their target genes. There is growing evidence that epigenetic mechanisms support the function of these transcriptional networks by regulating the accessibility of chromatin throughout development. Basal animal phyla are important models to gain insights into the evolution of transcriptional networks and their interplay with epigenetic modifications, yet no information on epigenetic regulation exists in animals outside the Bilateria. I will study the regulation of gene expression in Nematostella vectensis, which represents a sister group to the Bilateria. I plan to determine the genome-wide distribution of a Polycomb mediated histone modification to investigate if Polycomb mediated repression of developmental regulators is as complex in Nematostella as it is in bilaterian model organisms. I will also use characteristic chromatin signatures previously identified in mammalian cells to map transcriptional regulatory elements throughout the genome. Their functionality will be tested in transgenic Nematostella polyps, and their complexity compared to that in Bilaterians. These studies should provide crucial insights into the evolution of cis-regulatory elements and epigenetic silencing in transcriptional networks and how this contributed to the increasing complexity of animal body plans.

To verify this mechanism in an important human model, and to quantify variation in this model across a given population, peripheral blood monocytes will be collected from two pools of ten individuals each and differentiated to human monocyte derived macrophages (HMDMs). These HMDMs will then be treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to simulate an immune response. For each of the three cell states (monocyte, HMDM, HMDM+LPS), and each of the two pools, we will use high-throughput, sequence tag technologies (CAGE and RNA-seq) combined with Solexa sequencing to produce genome-wide surveys of transcription. We will then perform chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP- seq) for two marks of histone methylation (H3K9me2 and H3K9me3) and one mark of histone acetylation (H3K9ac) to produce genome-wide epigenetic maps. Through a systems biology approach, we will overlay these data sets upon the human genome and identify instances of strongly co-expressed retrotransposon/gene pairs where differential expression is accompanied by substantial chromatin modifications. We will then focus on those retrotransposon/gene pairs where the gene has a known immunological function. For each candidate retrotransposon/gene pair, validation will include RT-PCR to confirm expression of both elements, Sanger sequencing of the retrotransposon transcript to examine its structure, sequence and expression conservation analyses with rodent and pig to probe the evolutionary history of the retrotransposon/gene pair and an enhancer blocker assay for those retrotransposons that demarcate a chromatin boundary. Finally, we will construct gene networks underlying the human immune response to indicate the global role for each regulatory retrotransposon and rationalise these networks in terms of genetic variation across the sampled population.

531	Dr Ooi	Columbia University	None	2010-08-09	2015-08-08	Uncovering signals regulating epigenetic establishment and maintenance in mammals	Epigenetic processes regulate the transmission of gene transcription states during cellular differentiation, involved in the maintenance of pluripotency and differentiation. Aberrant gene expression is responsible for most noninfectious diseases and disease-associated epigenetic changes strongly correlate with a number of age-related human disorders, such as cancer, autoimmune disease and complex psychiatric disorders. How epigenetic states are established and maintained remains poorly defined and elucidating the mechanisms will help in biomarker development for screening purposes, as well as the identification of drug targets for disease treatment. The objectives outlined in this proposal will further define mechanisms involved in both the establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation. To identify regulators of maintenance methylation, I will generate an ES cell line carrying a GFP reporter targeting the Avy agouti locus for use in an RNAi screen. A second, independent RNAi screen will identify candidate germ cell-specific factors involved in DNA methylation establishment, using retroviral infection of ES cells. Objectives 3 and 4 of this proposal will follow up on my previous findings, showing that a regulator of DNA methylation establishment, Dnmt3L, binds the N terminus of the nucleosomal protein histone H3. This binding is inhibited by methylation at lysine 4 (H3K4), suggesting that factors affecting H3K4 methylation are involved in DNA methylation establishment. To test this, I will generate mice carrying a point mutation in the Dnmt3L gene, preventing the protein from binding histone H3. These mice will provide insight into the general importance of histone recognition by Dnmt3L. I also will examine H3K4 methylation status at DNA methylation target loci in mouse germ cells using a combination of mini-ChIP and IF-FISH. Analysis of factors known to affect H3K4 methylation will highlight functionally important factors for future study by mouse genetics.

We aim to examine the process of killing by CD8+ T-cells (CTL) at the molecular level to deliver novel cellular therapies for post-transplant viral infections and haematological cancers. We identified TCR-identical HIV specific CD8+ T-cell clones with distinct suppression of viral replication in vitro, antigen sensitivity, transcriptional signatures and cytokine profiles. In depth functional and molecular characterisation identified that the CTL clone with optimal viral suppression was most antigen responsive with higher expression of previously uncharacterized receptors bearing immunoreceptor tyrosine activating or inhibitory motives (ITAMS/ITIMS) and furthermore did not secrete tumour necrosis factor (TNF). Bisulfite sequencing identified heavy CpG methylation in the TNF core promoter indicating epigenetic modification of CTL effector function post antigen encounter. TCR-identical CTL can therefore be heterogeneous in function and small differences in ontogeny may have significant impacts on cytotoxic efficiency. We aim to identify the transcriptional signature of an “optimal” CTL with high killing efficiency, and identify pathways that can be manipulated to produce populations of CTL enriched with this signature for therapeutic use. This will use a two-pronged approach, using RNA sequencing to examine transcriptomes of ex vivo antigen-specific tetramer sorted CTL populations, combined with in vitro high throughput screening of epigenetic modifiers, drugs targeting known CTL signalling pathways and an shRNA screen focusing on the ITAM/ITIM genes identified above. Our aim is to extend our findings to a high-throughput genome wide ShRNA screen using CD8+ T-cell clones specific for EBV latency II antigens as expressed in 40% of Hodgkins and 20% of DLBC lymphomas. The high-throughput screen will utilise a flow cytometry based cytotoxicity assay at a titrated limiting antigen stimulus, to identify factors that modulate the cytotoxic efficacy of latency II EBV protein- specific CTL clones. Successful hits will be followed up by RNA-sequencing to define the molecular fingerprint of an antigen-experienced CD8+ T-cell with optimal killing efficiency and identify pathways and epigenetic networks that contribute to this state with the aim of producing a therapeutic product for infusion to patients with enhanced chance of cure.

Predicting diagnostic outcome in early undifferentiated arthritis, and disease course in patients developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA), are key goals. Leukocyte biomarkers have been examined as predictors of diagnosis and severity with disappointing results. However, synovial fibroblast markers remain unexplored as disease predictors despite the established role of these cells in mediating persistence of inflammation and directing joint damage. Recent research suggests epigenetic changes contribute to the distinctive, stable in vitro phenotype of RA synovial fibroblasts. We are using ultrasound-guided synovial biopsy to obtain tissue samples from patients with arthritis of less than 12 weeks duration, followed prospectively to determine outcome. We have established preliminary evidence of stromal markers that segregate with clinical outcome, giving clues to mechanisms of disease and also suggesting potential therapeutic targets. Whole genome sequencing technology is now being employed to detect further markers for disease resolution and persistence. This work will proceed in parallel with investigation of the epigenetic regulation of persistently altered genes in early and established RA versus resolving disease. This will be examined in Birmingham with high throughput sequencing whilst linked collaborative work on microRNA species continues in Zurich. This work will shed light on disease mechanisms and potential new therapeutic targets.	Versus Arthritis	Research Progression Award	196765.0	GBP

CTCF, a candidate tumour-suppressor gene, has emerged as a main player in controlling chromatin structure and function. CTCF, for CCCTC-binding factor, is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein highly conserved from Drosophila to human and identified as the vertebrate insulator protein. These insulators are DNA elements thought to partition the genome into independently regulated domains. The molecular basis of insulation seems to be linked to several long-range physical interactions between different portions of the chromatin fibre. By reporting co-localisation between CTCF and the cohesin complex, several studies may have lifted the veil on the mechanism mediating CTCF insulator function. Cohesin is a large ring-shaped protein complex thought to trap pairs of replicated chromosomes, known as sister chromatids, for segregation during the nuclear-division phase of the cell cycle. If cohesin rings can hold two sister chromatids, they might also be able to link a CTCF-binding site to other sequences or to another CTCF binding sites, some distance away along the chromosome. Moreover, without a doubt, the discovery of CTCF-cohesin interaction has not only provided a new perception on insulation, but also opened new perspectives about CTCF other multiple functions. At the chicken lysozyme locus, CTCF is associated with silencing. Our recent studies established that CTCF recruits cohesin at this silencer and that full transcriptional activation of this gene in macrophage correlates with a transcription dependent loss of CTCF/cohesin. By analysing available databases, we identified new CTCF binding sites at the vicinity of key regulators of myeloid differentiation as well as LPS-inducible genes and established cohesin co-localisation with CTCF at these binding sites. We want to understand how the presence of CTCF/cohesin affects the expression of these genes and whether this, in turn, affects the differentiation and the function of granulocytes and macrophages. Using myeloid cell lines and in vitro differentiation of mouse primary macrophages, we plan to analyse CTCF/cohesin interaction with the selected binding sites and the effect of aberrant expression of both protein on the expression of these genes, during myeloid differentiation. With emerging evidence pointed to the role of CTCF deregulation in the epigenetic imbalance in cancer, we also want to investigate the link between CTCF and DNA methylation in our system.

This will also be undertaken on BAL macrophages obtained from asthmatics before and after repeated experimental allergen challenge and on BAL macrophages exposed ex vivo to viral challenge. This will be done by RT-qPCR and Western Blot (the latter only for the genes involved in the defective pathways). 2) We will determine the functional role of the group of candidate microRNAs (as above) and miR-155 in regulating the pathways and cellular functions mentioned in the previous point. We will determine the effect of microRNAs on these pathways by employing synthetic oligonucleotides to manipulate microRNA expression, and the outcome will be measured by determining TNF-alpha and IFN secretion by ELISA. Pathogen binding ability to Haemophilus Influenzae and streptococcal sp, each labelled with propidium iodide, will be assessed by flow cytometry. 3) To determine whether this group of candidate microRNAs and their target genes are controlled by epigenetic marks in peripheral blood monocytes and asthmatic macrophages from patients in relationship to different levels of clinical severity (mild, severe asthmatics) or in relationship to the impact of environmental stimuli (in vivo experimental allergen challenge and in vitro exposure to rhinovirus). Comparison will be made to findings from healthy volunteer macrophages.

This results in reduced response rates and excess toxicity. Accurate repair of DNA is essential to the stability of the genome and consequently defective DNA repair is associated with tumourigenesis. 17% of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is characterised by defects in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway. Germline mutations in the major MMR genes (MLH1, MSH2, PMS2, MSH6), causing Lynch syndrome, account for up to 5%, whilst the remaining 12% are caused by somatic epigenetic changes, mainly involving the MLH1 promoter. This project aims to explore underlying defects in the MMR pathway as therapeutic targets in CRC, by utilising the concept of synthetic lethality (SL) to identify tumour-selectivity. Two genes are SL if a mutation in either gene alone is compatible with cellular viability, but the loss of both genes together results in cell death. Identified targets will be analysed for potential application in the clinical setting, concurrently developing predictive biomarkers. Project aims: 1) Performance of siRNA kinome screen to identify kinases whose loss of expression is synthetically lethal with deficiency of MLH1. An MLH1 deficient in vitro cell line model will be used with an isogenic MLH1 proficient comparator. Identified ‘hits‘ will be taken forwards for further mechanistic investigation, with the aim of identifying new therapeutic targets for clinical practice. 2) Performance of small molecule inhibitor screens to identify compounds where treatment causes selective cell death in the presence of MLH1 deficiency when compared to isogenic MLH1 proficient comparators. Identified compounds will be investigated for mechanism and clinical significance. 3) Analysis of samples from a therapeutic drug trial based on recent observations from this laboratory, treating CRC patients with MSHficiency with methotrexate, in tandem with the analysis of samples from methotrexate-treated patients with presumed MMR competency. In vitro studies have suggested that selective cell death occurs in MSH2 deficient cells on treatment with methotrexate, and that cell death is associated with an increase in the oxidative damage lesion, 8-OHdG. Human biological samples (leucocytes, serum and urine) will be analysed to evaluate the oxidative lesion, 8-OHdG, as a biomarker of treatment response.

Here, we use both embryo-derived stem cells and in vivo studies to investigate the epigenetic mechanisms leading to blastocyst lineage segregation and pluripotency safeguarding. Recent studies in ES cells showed that many silent genes that are required later on during development are simultaneously marked with Polycomb repressor (PRC)-mediated H3K27 methylation, and marks normally associated with gene activity. Moreover, these so-called bivalent genes assemble RNA Polymerase (RNAP) complexes and are transcribed at low level, specifying a 'primed' state in pluripotent cells. We have begun to compare the chromatin profiles of ES and TE- derived trophoblast stem (TS) cells. Though many genes are bivalently marked in TS cells as in ES cells, they are not normally expressed in this lineage. To explore this further, we will examine the chromatin environment of ES and TS cells at bivalent promoters by assessing PRC1 and PRC2 binding, RNAP occupancy and conformation and, additional 'lock in' mechanisms in TS cells that may operate to avoid reprogramming. We also address the role of key stem cell transcription factors in targeting chromatin changes using ES cell de-differentiation models upon Oct4 loss or gain of Cdx2. In order to confirm the biological significance of 'primed' chromatin in the embryo we will use carrier ChIP assay to investigate the epigenetic relationship between ES and TS cells and in vivo ICM and TE cells. In particular, we intend to explore how and when specific differences in epigenetic programming are specified, at the locus level, between embryonic and extraembryonic tissues. This will lead to in vivo lineage tracing studies where single blastomere knock-down (RNA interference), jointly labelled with a dye, can reveal the effects of epigenetic program failure on cell allocation.

However, an age-related reduction in crypt number and crypt cell proliferation, and an impaired ability of the epithelium to recover from injury, have all been observed in rodents. The canonical Wnt signalling pathway is the master regulator of intestinal epithelial renewal. Constitutive activation of Wnt signals disrupts intestinal tissue homeostasis in epithelial neoplasia, but preliminary evidence indicates that it also occurs with age in the apparently normal gut. Our pilot studies show that the activity of Wnt signals, and the degree of CpG island methylation of Wnt inhibitor genes, an epigenetic mechanism for gene silencing, both increase with age and vary markedly from crypt-to-crypt in the same individual. We propose that the development of increased Wnt signals along the crypt-axis reflects this age- dependent methylation of Wnt inhibitor genes. To test this hypothesis and understand the consequences for tissue homeostasis we will apply bioimaging and functional genomic approaches to a unique native human colonic crypt culture system. We will measure levels of CpG island methylation of Wnt inhibitor genes, and Wnt signals, in single crypts derived from human volunteers of widely differing age. Age- related variations in levels of DNA methyltransferase activity, and their responses to imposed molecular and cellular stress, will be quantified. We will use RNAi techniques to silence Wnt inhibitors and study the functional consequences for tissue renewal. Finally, we will build a database that can be interrogated with multivariate statistics to derive and test mechanistic hypotheses on the relationship between loss of epithelial tissue homeostasis and levels of CpG island methylation in a panel of Wnt inhibitor genes.

The work will (i) genotype variants found to be associated with behavioural, nutritional and physiological measures in previous studies outside of India t o confirm whether such associations are replicable; (ii) conduct pilot studies of DNA methylation of promoter regions of genes in which SNP variation has been found to have reliable phenotypic correlation, including genes investigated in the initial work, to identify loci within which there is sufficient variation in methylation to relate to outcomes; (iii) replicate preliminary data from UK studies demonstrating associations between DNA methylation patterns in a series of genes and body mass in dex and related phenotypes, within Indian samples; (iv) design and apply for funding to support adequately powered studies that would simultaneously incorporate environmentally modifiable exposures, genotypes proxying for these, DNA methylation data and outcomes within a single framework. My overall goal is to develop the knowledge base and skills required to establish the novel approach of genetical epigenomics for aetiological studies.	Wellcome Trust	Miscellaneous	82204.0	GBP

The goal of this research program is to fill the gap between the defined genetic level that characterize Duchenne Muscle Dystrophy and epigenetic mechanisms that cooperate to the onset and progression of this disease. Noncoding portions (repetitive and epigenetic elements) and (RNA) that characterizes most of the structure and output of the human genome is thought to play a fundamental role in epigenome regulation. Hence, in depth investigation of this emerging and largely mysterious world will prove to be mandatory for the comprehension, possible early diagnosis and potential treatment to ameliorate prognosis of this as well as other degenerative diseases.

The Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) is a heterogeneous syndrome which is characterised by severe intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation and typical dysmorphic features. The molecular data available suggest that BWS and SRS are caused by dysregulation of genes located on chromosome 11p15.5 and characterised by genomic imprinting. Genomic imprinting is a mechanism causing the expression of a gene to depend on its origin from mother or father. This process is controlled by epigenetic modifications, that are heritable characteristics of a gene (such as DNA methylation) not coded by its nucleotide sequence. Epigenetic defects and altered expression of imprinted genes of opposite types have been involved in BWS and SRS. The aim of this research project is to identify novel molecular alterations and determine the developmental stages, causes and mechanisms by which imprinting errors arise in BWS, SRS and related growth disorders.

The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) is a prospective cohort study with unprecedented scope and detail of information on thousands of people from before birth through to early adulthood, on their parents and now on their children. It is an internationally valued resource at the forefront of population-based research. ALSPAC allows the investigation of developmental trajectories marking critical periods in human life, the genetic and epigenetic factors contributing to heal th and disease and the environmental exposures which form the context within which these processes act. As ALSPAC participants enter adulthood and start having children, the study's potential to contribute to scientific discovery is expanding, giving a greater capacity to explore links between current and future health and the intergenerational components of health and disease. ALSPAC is unequivocally the richest open-access epidemiological resource in the world. Our goals are to ensure that ALS PAC (i) is sustained, (ii) has participation maximised and (iii) is enhanced. These goals will be delivered by follow-up of the original cohort through clinic assessment, questionnaires and record linkage, data collection on their children, consolidation of GWAS data on all participants and the development of epigenomics research.

DNA replication is readily interrupted by DNA damage and by naturally occurring secondary structures forming in the DNA itself. DNA damage frequently stalls the replicative DNA polymerases but can be replicated by specialised translesion DNA polymerases, which possess active sites that are capable of accommodating damaged or distorted DNA templates. While the use of these polymerases allows replication to be completed it also increases the chance of mutagenesis. A major goal of the lab has been to understand how and when these enzymes are deployed and how their activity is regulated to allow efficient and safe replication of damaged DNA. We have shown that in addition to assisting in the replication of damaged DNA, some specialised polymerases, acting in concert with specialised DNA helicases, also play a role in the replication of DNA secondary structures. We have shown how replication stalling by DNA secondary structure formation (e.g. G quadruplex and triplex DNA) interrupts histone recycling and locally prevents the proper inheritance of histone modifications through cell division leading to altered gene expression. This observation has linked replication stress to disruption of epigenetic memory and to variations in gene expression, a feature of many cancer cells. Our data suggests that secondary structural impediments to replication are very frequent and rival DNA damage as a source of replication stress, requiring a poorly understood and complex network of factors to suppress them. We are working to further understand these mechanisms and how cells prevent DNA replication impediments impairing epigenetically encoded transcriptional memory and genomic integrity. Finally, our work, which predominantly uses somatic cell genetics, has also led to the identification and development of cell lines capable of continuous mutagenesis which we have used to evolve specific antibody specificities and other proteins of therapeutic interest.

X inactivation is the mechanism that has evolved in mammals to equalise gene dosage on the X chromosome in XX females relative to XY males. Work in the 1990s established that the master regulator for chromosome silencing is a large non-coding (nc)RNA, designated Xist (X inactive Specific Transcript). Xist RNA is transcribed from the inactive X (Xi) elect and coats the entire chromosome territory in cis. This in turn triggers chromosome wide transcriptional silencing and the establishment of a s table and heritable inactive chromatin state. X inactivation provides a powerful model system for understanding the function of ncRNAs and the role of epigenetic mechanisms, for example DNA methylation and chromatin modification, in genome regulation during cellular differentiation and development. Central questions in the field that this proposal will tackle are: 1. How does Xist RNA instigate chromosome wide silencing? 2. What are the mechanisms that confer stability and heritability of the inactive state, and how do they link to the primary silencing mechanism and to one another? 3. How are de novo DNA methyltransferases targeted in X inactivation and at other genomic sites? In addition to answering basic research questions this work will have relevance to understanding disease states, specifically epigenome regulation in cancer, chromosome instability and craniofacial abnormalities (ICF) syndrome, linked to mutations in the Dnmt3b gene, and Facioscapulohumeral dystr opy (FSHD type I and II) linked to mutations in SMCHD1.

This research will help to understand the processes of cell pluripotency, plasticity and differentiation. We work mainly with human and murine cell lines and tissues. We use a combination of biochemical, molecular biology and subcellular imaging methods to investigate long-range inter-chromosomal interactions, the dynamics and proteomic content of transcription factories, and epigenetic roles of poised RNA polymerase II forms. We are currently developing a novel high-throughput assay to describe and quantify whole-genome interactions in cell nuclei. This will provide quantitative information on genome folding inside the mammalian nucleus that will permit modelling of chromosome organisation and may in the future allow for prediction of more efficient and safer integration sites for gene therapy, diagnostic of stem cell properties in regenerative therapy and a better understanding of the chromosomal rearrangements that lead to cancer. As the technology has commercial potential, we are working towards filing a patent.|Objectives:|1.

553	Prof Wendy Bickmore	University of Edinburgh	None	2010-03-01	2015-03-01	Determining the roles of the nuclear periphery in mammalian genome function	DNA sequence and epigenetic chromatin maps are important in understanding how genomes are regulated. However, these maps are linear and do not account for the three-dimensional context within which the genome functions in the cell. The spatial organisation of the genome in the nucleus is not random and is conserved in evolution, implying that it is under functional selection. This proposal aims to determine the functional significance of positioning specific genome regions at the edge of the nucleus in mammalian cells. The nuclear periphery has conventionally been considered as a zone of inactive chromatin and transcriptional repression. Several regulatory gene loci move away from the nuclear periphery as they are activated during differentiation. Novel approaches, developed by ourselves and others, that allow genomic regions to be relocated from the centre of the nucleus to the periphery, have directly shown that proximity to the nuclear edge can down-regulate human gene expression. We propose to dissect the pathways that mediate this spatially-defined transcriptional regulation, to determine what features make certain genes susceptible to it, to establish the functional consequences of preventing gene repositioning during differentiation, and to examine defects of the periphery found in premature ageing. A neglected hypothesis is that positioning of inactive chromatin against the nuclear periphery is a mechanism to minimize DNA damage on sequences in the nuclear centre. We will determine whether mutation rate is altered when loci are repositioned towards the nuclear periphery. By experimentally remodelling the spatial organisation of the genome, this proposal goes beyond the current descriptive phase of 3D nuclear organisation, into an understanding of its functional consequences on multiple aspects of genome function. It will also aid in understanding human diseases characterised by alterations of the nuclear periphery.	European Research Council	Advanced Grant	1701090.0	EUR

Vertebrate size is established based on total cell number generated during development. Despite the 75 million-fold difference in size between the smallest and largest mammals, the mechanisms for this remain to be determined. This proposal seeks insight into how total cell number is determined in both pathological and physiological states. Over the last decade our study of extreme growth disorders has identified 18 new human disease genes. We established these encode core components of the cell-cycle machinery, providing cellular and developmental insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of these disorders. From our starting point of human disease, this approach also revealed novel genome instability genes informing fundamental research of basic biological processes. Still, the molecular basis for over half of individuals with microcephalic dwarfism remains unknown. This proposal will break new ground through the comprehensive application of Whole Genome Sequencing to our patient cohort to achieve screen saturation via identification of coding and non-coding mutations. Forward-genetic genome-wide CRISPR screens in developmentally relevant cell and organoid systems will also be developed to define key cellular processes impacting human growth. Beyond these ‘discovery science’ approaches, cellular and model organism techniques will be used to define the mechanistic basis for human disease caused by mutations in core replication machinery and key epigenetic factors. To extend prior work on pathophysiological mechanisms, we aim to establish a subset of microcephalic dwarfism genes as growth regulators, and thereby further define when and how organism size is determined. These studies will link essential cellular machinery governing proliferation with human disease, identify novel genome-stability factors and may yield insights into the developmental regulation of mammalian size.

My bias is to take a biochemical approach by studying DNA-protein interactions: both between transcription factors and regulatory sequences and also of the chromatin/nucleoid-proteins within genes or genomic domains. The competitive advantage of this work is that we would be first to adapt a suite of powerful and informative eukaryotic techniques to prokaryotes. Predicted outcomes from this work include: new knowledge of a predecessor of eukaryotic chromatin; the development of a model system for biochemical analysis of chromatin more tractable than eukaryotic ones; the creation of a technology platform capable of controlling bacterial gene expression, with implications for engineering of microbial strains for industrial biotechnology and also as novel therapies to treat infection; fresh insights into how to manipulate bacterial secondary metabolism. Hence, there are two main themes. Firstly, a study of epigenetic regulation of secondary metabolism as early evidence has shown that something akin to chromatin-structure exists in S. coelicolor and affects expression of secondary metabolic genes. Can these insights be used to derepress 'cryptic' pathways in exotic actinomycetes to discover new chemical diversity? Secondly the development of 'Nucleoproteomics'- specifically using Transcription Factor Decoys (TFDs) as a genomic tool to map DNA-protein interactions. The aim being to develop a complimentary technology to transcriptomic microarray analysis that provides information about the DNA- protein interactions that control patterns of expression. One of the unique features of this approach would be determining how in vivo post-translational modificiation of transcription factors affect expression.

It will examine variation in epigenetic marking, gene expression and biomarkers of metabolic health in children exposed to markedly different nutritional regimen in very early postnatal life and contribute to understanding the mechanisms linking adverse exposures in early life with common diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes in later life. Nutritional stresses in early life have long-lasting effects on metabolism and health. Through work on animal models, epigenetic phenomena have been identified as a providing a potential candidate mechanism to explain this association. Early postnatal life offers a critical window" during which nutritional stresses can programme the subsequent health of an individual. By studying a cohort of infants born preterm and who participated in a randomised nutritional intervention trial of preterm and term formula feeding, we aim to investigate the role of epigenetic events in mediating persistent differential gene expression and altered health in children 10-12 years later. Epigenetic markings refer to chemical modifications to DNA and histone proteins that regulate transcriptional activity. This study will focus on DNA methylation. Techniques to detect and compare DNA methylation on a large scale have only been developed in recent years. This study will employ a microarray approach to screen for differences in DNA methylation and gene expression. Methylation differences at selected loci will be verified by quantitative, sequenced- based analysis using Pyrosequencing technology. Differential gene expression at selected loci will be quantified and verified using Real-Time PCR.

Aim 2: We will develop and make readily accessible the causal analysis methods and tools and apply Mendelian randomization (MR) to epigenetic questions. Aim 3: We will use DNA methylation as an index of past exposures to improve our prediction of disease risk and prognosis. Aim 4: From neurodevelopment to cancer, there are a multitude of settings in which we can apply epigenetic epidemiology to understand disease mechanisms and predict disease. Methods: We will utilize multiple data sources; from in-house studies, via collaborations and consortia, and through publicly accessible repositories. Our primary focus will be on the analysis of DNA methylation, as this continues to be the most readily available source of epigenetic data in population-based studies. However, we will integrate these data with newly generated and publicly available epigenomic and transcriptomic data, tissue-specific data and histone modification data. A wide range of methods will be applied. These include mQTL analysis, functional annotation and machine learning approaches, such as penalized regression, support vector machines, and neural networks. We will test for mediation using MR and apply our prediction methods in disease relevant datasets. Translation: The output arising from this programme will be used to develop biomarkers of disease risk and disease prognosis. It will also shed light on the genetic architecture of DNA methylation and the causal role this molecular phenotype plays in development and disease, which will in turn inform future interventions.

To date, we have shown: (1) LIMD1 is localised to chromosome 3p21.3, a region that commonly undergoes early homozygous deletion, loss of heterozygosity and epigenetic silencing in many carcinomas, including the lung. (2) LIMD1 protein expression is reduced in 80% of lung adeno and squamous cell carcinomas. (3) Stable expression of LIMD1 in lung cancer cell lines significantly reduces their ability to form lung tumours in mice. (4) Limd1-/- knockout mice are predisposed to chemically-induced lung adenocarcinomas and (5) Genetic inactivation of Limd1 in mice heterozygous for oncogenic K-Ras(G12D) show markedly increased tumour initiation, progression, and mortality. To determine how LIMD1 works as a TSG and advance our understanding of the early molecular pathogenesis of lung cancer we have identified LIMD1 as a critical regulator of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated gene silencing. Depletion of endogenous LIMD1 results in loss of miRNA-mediated gene silencing. AIM/OBJECTIVES: The above discovery prompting the following hypothesis: ‘Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung is a disease of cancer stem cell formation and LIMD1 loss plays a critical role in mediating this transition through deregulation of miRNA-silencing’. To test our hypothesis we will recapitulate the LIMD1 loss that is observed in SCC, in vitro, using human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC). We will then scrutinize the phenotype in vitro and in vivo for evidence of transformation. METHODS: We will use Lentiviral-driven vector systems to obtain both stable shRNA-driven LIMD1 knockdown in HBECs. We will then perform in vitro and in vivo tumourigenicity assays. The functional readout of which will then be used to correlate with miRNA/mRNA profiles obtained from Deep Sequencing of the same HBEC lines. i.e. align the transformed phenotype with its respective RNA profile and examine how this is influenced by LIMD1 loss. HOW THE RESULTS OF THIS RESEARCH WILL BE USED: These results will indicate the functional significance of LIMD1 loss in human lung epithelia. Furthermore, we will identify ‘LIMD1-loss’ specific downstream miRNAs and signalling pathways to investigate with respect to lung cancer biology with the aim of using these to develop methods for increasing early detection and novel ‘early disease’ treatments.

Thereby inactivation of one of the two X chromosomes in female cells is established in the early embryo by expression of the noncoding Xist (inactive X specific transcript) RNA and maintained throughout life in all somatic tissues. X inactivation is essential for mouse development. In somatic cells, loss of Xist expression leads to the development of leukaemia. In human, subtypes of breast and ovarian cancers lack an inactive X chromosome (Xi) and show elevated X-linked gene expression. Increased numbers of X chromosomes have further been reported in testicular tumors indicating that elevated X chromosome dosage can be associated with tumorigenesis in both sexes. Recent studies have further provided evidence that loss of dosage compensation is an early event in tumor formation in both mice and humans.This proposal aims to characterize the differential requirement for dosage compensation between normal and tumor cells with the aim of identifying cells from which tumors can arise and dosage sensitive tumor drivers on the X chromosome. Understanding the underlying molecular basis will provide insight into epigenetic regulation in development and will contribute to strategies for discrimination of tumor from normal cells.For addressing this question the proposal is divided in two parts that will be pursued in parallel. Subproject A focuses on the investigation of the cellular context for Xi reactivation. This part is based on a conditional mutation of Xist. Cells that reactivate the Xi will be identified in mouse development by using a GFP reporter and their relevance for tumor formation will be characterized. In parallel, we will investigate whether cell transformation can induce Xi reactivation. This approach will apply a panel of well-studied oncogenes and establish a relation between oncogenic signals and Xi reactivation.Subproject B focuses on the molecular mechanism of gene repression on the Xi. For this inducible Xist expression in mice will be applied to characterize the developmental context for Xist function. We expect to delineate cells with specific epigenetic properties in development from which tumors potentially arise. For investigating the molecular mechanism of gene repression by Xist we will perform a genetic screen based on inducible Xist expression from the single X chromosomes in haploid embryonic stem cells. Gene trap mutations will be introduced by viral of transposon mediated strategies and subsequently selected for survival after Xist induction. We anticipate to identify novel epigenetic regulators and establish their relevance for X inactivation and tumor formation.Results of both subprojects will comprehensively advance our understanding of the role of dosage compensation in normal and tumor development and provide new strategies for discriminating normal cells from cancer.

Studies in genetic model organisms have provided a framework for developmental and molecular biology. In contrast, forward genetic approaches have been limited in mammalian systems. Mammalian genetics has largely relied on engineering targeted mutations in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. This has enabled an exploration of functional parallels and differences between mice and genetic model organisms.The requirement of crossing heterozygous mutations to homozygosity for identifying recessive phenotypic traits makes genetics in mice expensive and time consuming, thereby limiting the extent of genetic screens. This has led to a search for alternative approaches in cell based systems. RNA interference based screens using genome wide libraries have been applied to make important discoveries in recent years. However, saturation of such screens and efficient impairment of gene function cannot be easily achieved by this technology. Insertion mutagenesis of Blm deficient mouse ES cells or near haploid human tumor cell lines has also been described. These systems have been successfully used for the identification of host factors for pathogens and receptors for toxins, but have limitations due to the altered genetic background and technical peculiarities.The recent development of haploid embryonic stem cell lines has opened a new area of genetic investigation in mammals. These cells maintain to a large extent a pluripotent developmental potential including germ line competence. This suggests their suitability for screens in signalling, gene regulation, and differentiation. A haploid karyotype provides the advantage that when mutations are introduced they are in a hemizygous state and, thus, lead to immediate phenotypic consequences. The feasibility of screening in haploid ES cells has been explored by using gene trap vectors to generate mutation pools that can be subsequently selected for specific phenotypic alterations. In addition, haploid ES cells can be derived from transgenic and gene targeted mice, thereby allowing to introduce genetic reporter alleles for detailed interrogation of pathways. It is expected that haploid ES cells can be applied to a wide range of questions in development and disease. Crucial for this technology is the availability of pure haploid populations of cells. We have optimized the methodology based on high speed cell sorting for purifying the haploid cells based on DNA staining in living cells.The present application aims at the establishment of a genetic screening platform for investigating complex mammalian pathways at the ETH Zurich based on haploid ES cells.First, we will make haploid stem cell technology available to the research community within the Platform Life Science HPL building of the ETH Zurich. A number of timely original research projects in epigenetic research, cell signalling, and disease pathways are part of this proposal. This will complement existing infrastructure and extend the experimental capabilities in the context of the mouse facility that includes a large phenotyping platform.Second, the Beckman Coulter MoFlo XDP high-speed cell sorter will add to the existing infrastructure and ensure the increasing demand in sorting mammalian stem cells as well as of various differentiated cell types can be met at ETH Zurich.

Up to 40% of patients die, while cure is associated with disabling life-long therapy-associated late-effects. The accurate identification of medulloblastoma disease-risk and molecular features therefore has major potential to improve outcomes, through guiding (i) therapeutic reduction in favourable-risk cases, (ii) treatment intensification or modification in high-risk cases, and (iii) the targeted delivery of novel molecular agents. Our group have identified key prognostic biomarkers which will, for the first time in paediatric neuro-oncology, direct therapeutic stratification in groundbreaking European clinical trials for the clinical 'standard-risk' group (~50% of all cases). However, the biological basis of the majority of medulloblastomas, and its clinical relevance, remains poorly understood. Importantly, equivalent strategies in the poor prognosis clinical high-risk groups (infants 3 years old and/or patients with metastatic disease), and patients who have relapsed following initial therapy, have not been developed. Aims: To discover, develop and validate prognostic and predictive biomarkers with utility to direct individualised therapy for medulloblastoma. These biomarkers will support new treatment strategies including molecular disease-risk stratification and delivery of targeted therapeutics, together leading to enhanced survival rates and reduced therapeutic late-effects and toxicities. Methods: Our programme will address all clinical disease-risk groups. Biological investigations will centre on the identification of putative biomarkers in primary tumour and tumour-associated (e.g. cerebrospinal fluid, blood) material, through (i) genomic and epigenetic screening using microarray and next-generation sequencing methods, and (ii) the detailed characterisation of established, reported and novel biomarkers of potential therapeutic significance. The clinico-pathological significance of biomarkers identified, and their prognostic and predictive utility, will be established and validated in extensive retrospective cohorts. Following the development of routine tests and assessment criteria, biomarker utility for treatment individualisation will be tested prospectively in National and European Phase III trials aimed at the maximisation of survival alongside the minimisation of late-effects (prognostic & predictive biomarkers), and for guiding the delivery of novel molecular targeted therapies in early- and late-phase trials (predictive biomarkers). How the results of this research will be used: This comprehensive strategy links biomarker development directly with clinical application. Findings will be incorporated into (i) planning of the next wave of medulloblastoma trials, through our leading roles in National and European trials groups, and (ii) our ongoing research programme, aimed at delivering improved outcomes for children with medulloblastoma.

New therapies have produced some clinical successes, but a subset of patients progress to incurable castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) and it is not yet possible to predict which patients will respond best to which treatments. There is an urgent need to develop better biomarkers with which to stratify patient populations and to personalise therapies in order improve clinical outcome. PROPOSED AIMS There is a rapidly accruing body of evidence that noncoding RNAs are frequently involved in regulating processes within the cell by interacting with the epigenetic machinery. We will use in vitro studies to generate combined RNA and epigenetic profiles of sensitive and resistant PCa cell lines in response to drug treatment. We will establish a catalogue of noncoding RNAs with putative mechanistic impact on drug response. These genes will then be used as the basis to define and then validate biomarkers of sensitivity and resistance, by combining expression data generated from a large cohort of matched tumour normal clinical samples obtained from the Manchester Cancer Research centre Biobank with public domain TCGA expression datasets. EXPECTED OUTCOMES We expect first to develop a list of noncoding RNAs of mechanistic importance in PCa. This will be of great utility to the nascent noncoding RNA community. We will then using Machine Learning (ML) approaches to build and validate classifiers of drug sensitivity before investigating their utility when applied to circulating tumour cells. Successful validation of the signature will lead to the development of a companion diagnostic with which to inform PCa patient treatment decisions.	Prostate Cancer UK	PhD Studentships	139722.0	GBP
564	Dr Susan Morgan	University of Birmingham	None	2003-09-01	2007-08-31	Genetic and epigenetic events in the pathogenesis of paediatric Hodgkin's Disease	Hodgkin's disease is an unusual cancer because it is characterised by a relative paucity of malignant, so-called Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells, in a background of abundant 'reactive' non-malignant cells. Because of the rarity of the HRS cells and technical limitations to their isolation, knowledge of the impact of cytogenetic and epigenetic phenomena on clinical outcome and association with specific disease characteristics, including EBV status, is not available, especially in childhood HD. This is in contrast to many other solid tumours where the significance of chromosomal imbalances is well defined. In this study we will describe chromosome imbalances in paediatric HD, particularly focussing on the notion that the EBV-positive and EBV-negative variants are genetically distinct. Furthermore, we will determine the significance of these imbalances by analysis of gene expression from specific chromosome locations using Affymetrix GeneChip arrays and immunohistochemistry to probe a well-characterised archive of paediatric HD tumours. Through the use of gene expression analysis of HD-derived cell lines before and after treatment with demethylating agents we will also investigate the prevalence and significance of hypermethylation and loss of expression of known and candidate tumour suppressor genes in paediatric HD.

565	Prof Eric Miska	University of Cambridge	None	2005-01-01	2009-12-31	Control of gene expression through regulatory RNAs	My general interest is to understand how cells interpret genetic and epigenetic information as well as environmental cues to determine their correct cell fate, i.e. to make the decision to divide, die or differentiate. For cells to assume their correct fate is essential for development, epistasis and regeneration of any tissue, organ or organism. Elucidating the principles and molecular pathways underlying cell fate decisions is crucial for understanding how cells become corrupted in disease. The recent discovery of a large conserved class of small RNA genes, through the study of the control of developmental timing in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, opened up a new and unexpected dimension of gene regulation. Although we know very little about the biology of these small RNAs, the few examples that have been studied suggest that these genes are likely to have a major impact in many areas of biology. My laboratory will concentrate on basic questions on how microRNAs control gene expression. Specifically, I would like to address the following questions: 1. Where and when are microRNAs expressed? 2. What are the direct targets of microRNAs? 3. How do microRNAs interface with known pathways that regulate cell division, death and differentiation? 4. What are the mechanisms of microRNA action? Our approach will be multi-facetted, combining molecular genetics in C. elegans, microarray expression analysis, bioinformatics and functional studies in mammalian cell lines.

We have shown that extracts from muscle invasive (MI) bladder tumours repair DSBs using a microhomology-associated end-joining (MMEJ) mechanism distinct from the non-homologous end-joining seen in normal cells. MRE11 is an important component of the DNA DSB signalling pathway, and we have shown that patients with low MRE11 protein expression in their bladder tumour biopsies prior to radiotherapy treatment have a worse treatment outcome. Chemical carcinogens from cigarette smoke and occupational exposures can damage bladder DNA and predispose an individual to bladder cancer. Individuals with genetic variants in relevant DNA repair pathways have an increased bladder cancer risk. Relevance to cancer Bladder cancer is the fifth commonest cancer in the UK, and muscle invasive disease is treated by removal of the bladder or radiotherapy, and in some cases chemotherapy. The MMEJ phenotype may be exploitable clinically in combined radiotherapy/biological treatments, the use of biomarkers may allow patient selection for optimal bladder cancer treatment, thus increasing overall cure rates, and determining those genetic variants implicated in bladder cancer risk would allow identification of high risk individuals, who would benefit from prophylactic interventions to minimize bladder cancer mortality. Specific aims of the research 1. to further investigate the non-homologous end-joining defective/microhomology-mediated end-joining phenotype seen in muscle invasive bladder cancer, 2. to further investigate MRE11 and establish biomarkers, including DNA damage signalling protein expression, which can be used for prediction of outcome following radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and 3. to establish which DNA repair gene germline variants are important in bladder cancer aetiology. Outline plan of research Putative MMEJ regulatory factors will be examined in a large panel of tumour extracts and a cell-based model, using the I-SceI assay and microbeam DNA damage experiments. The clinical exploitability of MMEJ will be explored using tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The mechanisms underlying low MRE11 expression will be investigated to establish whether control is at the genetic, epigenetic, transcriptional or translational level or whether post-transcriptional control mechanisms are involved. Immunohistochemistry studies will be expanded to include other DSB signalling and cell cycle and DNA repair proteins. Rare germline XPC variants will be studied in a case-control study to assess influence on bladder cancer risk, and their significance determined by various functional assays, as shall other germline nucleotide excision repair variants which may influence microRNA binding to the 3'untranslated region.

Indeed on top of the primary sequence, epigenetic factors such as levels of chromatin packaging, histone modifications, and DNA methylation, contribute to the decision of switching genes on and off. Alterations in gene expression patterns accompany tumour progression, which is often associated with aberrant DNA methylation patterns. Both hypomethylation more prominent at repeat elements, and hyper-methylation of CpG islands are observed in cancer cells. Our published data indicate that antisense RNA transcription through a CpG island can induce its methylation. Similarly, antisense transcripts have been implicated in the methylation of CpG islands observed in imprinting and X-inactivation. We want to investigate whether such a mechanism underlies some of the methylation changes observed during tumourigenesis through the analysis of patients with haematopoietic malignancies. We have also developed a functional system to study the molecular details responsible for antisense-RNA mediated CpG island methylation. Understanding the basic mechanisms will provide us with invaluable tools for future development of better targeted therapies and drugs.	Cancer Research UK	Project Award	None	None
568	Dr Grant Stewart	University of Birmingham	Cancer Sciences	2015-01-01	2017-12-31	Defining a fundamental role for histone methylation in preventing DNA damage-induced replication catastrophe	'Replication stress' is a term that encompasses any type of abnormality that obstructs replication, the common result of which is increased genome instability. In addition to the well-established link between genomic instability and tumour development, it is becoming increasingly evident that replication stress is also an important pathological process underlying the development of human disease. It is thought that failed replication caused by unrepaired DNA damage leads to increased cell death, particularly in highly proliferative tissues. This is exemplified by the human syndrome Fanconi Anaemia (FA), which is characterised by developmental defects, progressive bone marrow failure, tumour predisposition and a hypersensitivity to agents that induce replication stress e.g. Mitomycin C (MMC). The study of human disorders such as FA and the cellular pathways affected in these patients has significantly furthered our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that have evolved to protect against the deleterious effects of replication stress. Here we have identified PFAP (Putative Fanconi Anaemia Protein), a member of a histone methyltransferase complex, as a novel suppressor of replication stress. Cells lacking PFAP exhibit a strikingly similar phenotype to that associated with defects in the FA DNA repair pathway, such as a hypersensitivity to MMC, damage-induced replication abnormalities and chromosomal breakage following exposure to MMC. Taken together, these data suggest that PFAP functions to coordinate the repair of replication-associated DNA damage in conjunction with the FA pathway. Our finding that PFAP depleted cells also have reduced levels of histone methylation provides the first evidence of a mechanistic link between epigenetic histone modification and the maintenance of genome stability. Our proposal focuses on understanding how PFAP promotes the repair of damaged replication forks and whether this is mediated through histone methylation.

569	Dr Adele Murrell	University of Cambridge	None	2005-04-01	2011-03-31	Loss of imprinting of insulin growth factor II gene: A potential heritable marker for cancer predisposition	The imprinted Insulin-like growth factor2 (IGF2) gene is overexpressed in Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and many cancers. In most cases IGF2 overexpression is due to epimutation such as DNA methylation changes that result in loss of imprinting. Up to 10% of normal individuals have loss of IGF2 imprinting and may be susceptible to cancer1. We have described genetic variation in IGF2 associated with upstream loss of methylation in BWS patients2. Further preliminary studies suggest that genetic variation also confers protection against breast cancer. Long range interactions between differentially methylated regulatory elements (DMRs) at this locus would affect epigenetic and genetic interactions. In murine systems we have demonstrated that the DMRs of Igf2 interact with the H19 boundary element to form a higher order chromatin structure3. Chromatin modifying proteins, such as CTCF presumably maintain higher order chromatin structure at this locus4. Specific aims are to determine if loss of IGF2 methylation is a predisposing biomarker in breast cancer and whether IGF2 genotypes influence methylation. Further aims are to identify the proteins involved in maintenance of chromatin structure and to evaluate whether these and other proteins can be used to manipulate IGF2 imprinting in vivo. Outline plans are to carry out a prospective epidemiological study to screen breast cancer and control individuals for loss of methylation in IGF2. Secondary chromatin structure of IGF2 will be examined (chromosome conformation capture). A transgenic GAL4 system previously used to detect chromatin looping will be used to isolate proteins that interact at the DMRs. The ability of CTCF and BORIS to modify chromatin and Igf2-H19 imprinting will be evaluated in vivo. 1. Cui et al (2003) Science 299, 1753-1755 2. Murrell et al (2004) HMG 13, 1-9. 3.

Classically it has been presumed that genes are autonomous in their expression. However, there is increasing evidence that in both health and disease, gene expression is not autonomous. In all eukaryotic genomes highly co-expressed genes and housekeeping genes cluster. In cell fate specification, blocks of up or down regulated genes are observed and in cancers we see unusual blocks of genes downregulated. Importantly, the first gene therapy trials had to be stopped as the expression of the introduced gene affected the expression of an oncogenic neighbour. What is less clear is what the underlying mechanisms are for such non-autonomous expression. Here we take advantage of an emerging model system for the analysis of gene-gene interactions, the DIRAS3/GNG12-AS1 expression in humans. We have discovered that DIRAS3 transcription is modulated through transcriptional interference (TI) from an lncRNA, GNG12-AS1. We have found that we can inhibit GNG12-AS1 either at its transcription level or post-transcriptionally by selective siRNA targeting. We intend to use this system to test two models for TI, one that considers polymerase collision/pausing, and another that transcription of one locus alters promoter accessibility at the other. The techniques that we will use will be allele-specific capture chromatin conformation (C-HiC) and Nuclear run assays (GROseq), R-loop and RNAPII ChIP in combination with gene editing to examine the effects of transcription through specific genomic features on TI. The results of these studies will lead a better understanding of non-autonomous gene expression, which is key to understanding the potential pitfalls of gene therapy, the effects of genome rearrangements (in cancers or in evolutionary time) as well as guide epigenetic therapies aimed at reversibly modulating gene expression.

However, certain limitations of conventional epidemiology preclude confident causal inference. A major challenge now is to distinguish causal effects, of importance for understanding disease pathogenesis and prevention, from non-causal associations, which in-turn may inform risk prediction. We propose an ambitious programme to integrate multiple high-throughput ‘omics’ platforms within large-scale epidemiological studies. We will apply innovative causal analysis methods (Mendelian randomization, MR) to robustly discriminate between exposures that are causally associated with cancer risk and progression, and hence are possible targets for intervention, from non-causal biomarkers with potential predictive utility. Our main focus is on modifiable nutritional and lifestyle exposures, related intermediate phenotypes, and novel metabolomic and epigenetic biomarkers, in cancers of the prostate, lung, kidneys, head and neck, breast and ovaries. The programme involves large international cancer consortia (e.g. 65,000 prostate, 16,000 lung and 10,000 renal cancers), from which genetic data for variants with established effects on the exposures of interest will be sought, and individual well-characterised cohorts for intensive phenotyping. It is hosted by Bristol (which houses a world-leading centre for integrating ‘omics technologies into causal understanding and major prostate and head and neck cancer cohorts), in collaboration with IARC (kidney, lung, head and neck cancer) and Manchester (breast, ovarian cancer). Aims: i. Test and estimate the causal effects of potentially modifiable exposures and intermediate phenotypes with cancer risk and progression, using genetic variants as exposure-proxies (Mendelian randomization) (work package 1 (WP1). ii. Identify novel metabolomic and epigenetic signatures of exposures, evaluate their utility as predictive biomarkers and investigate their causal relationship with cancer risk and progression (WP2). iii. Understand mechanisms potentially amenable to intervention, through: a) systematic reviews of mechanistic studies based on cancer-causing exposures identified in WP1; and b) studies to recall population sub-groups, or their bio-samples, according to genotype for deep phenotyping (WP3). A cross-cutting Bioinformatics strand will develop infrastructure for large-scale data processing, ‘omics data integration and data sharing. A Knowledge Transfer strand will inform opportunities for translation. The programme aligns closely with CRUK’s strategy for cancer prevention and biomarkers by facilitating causal inference regarding exposures of major importance in cancer, and informing future RCTs, evidence-based guidelines and biomarker discovery.

CD4+ T cells differentiate into a number of effector types that define the immune response to different pathogens. Differentiation into specialized effectors is linked to changes in chromatin structure at key genes and transcription factors have been identified that are critical for this process. These epigenetic modifications provide a memory of cellular state passed onto cellular descendents. T cell effector types are also remarkably plastic and this combination of specificity and plasticity i s likely to be critical for the normal regulation of T cell effector function. We will identify the changes in histone methylation that occur across the genome during differentiation of primary human CD4+ T cells. We will test the hypothesis that lineage-specific gene expression is regulated primarily at the level of transcriptional elongation and determine the role of master regulator transcription factors. From these data, we will develop a conceptual framework that explains the specificity an d plasticity of the helper T cell response.

The transcription process involves cis and trans components and the right combination of both is required for transcription to proceed. Transcription by RNA polymerase II involves the assembly of general and specific transcription factors on the core promoter to form a preinitiation complex. Specific transcription factors are responsible for specific patterns of gene expression, acting on specific promoters. Understanding how these factors interact with their partners and targets is fundamental to understanding cell type specification. There is increasing evidence that this process is controlled by networks of interacting transcription factors and that subtle variations in protein partners may have profound consequences for gene expression programs.On the other hand, epigenetic modifications regulate the interpretation of genetic information. Epigenetic gene regulation works at two levels. One level is DNA methylation, the other chromatin modification. DNA methylation is found at the C-5 position of cytosine residues. DNA methylation is associated with gene silencing by inhibition of interaction between transcription factors and DNA, and recruitment of heterochromatin proteins. Chromatin is another central target for epigenetic modifications. Transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin is packed densely, whereas active euchromatin is less condensed. The core components of chromatin are the histone octamers, which consist of the histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. The histones can be subject to covalent modifications. These modifications can be acetylation, phosphorylation or methylation. Histone acetylation has been found to correlate with active transcription, likewise histone phosphorylation. However, histone methylation appears to have diverse functions in the control of gene activity.Both processes, transcription factor binding to the promoter and chromatin modification are interlinked. Therefore we cannot understand one without the other.Our group is focused on the study of Haematopoiesis. We plan a comprehensive analysis of transcription factors and chromatin status in relation to gene expression. We plan to do a single cell analysis of the different factors affecting cell lineage commitment. Once we have accomplished the analysis we will test how changing the balance between the different factors emerging from the analysis can drive the cell into cell specification and pathology.

CRUK has identified brain tumours as a cancer with a substantial unmet need in its new Research Strategy and is committed to increasing research efforts into neuro-oncology. UCL supports the need to dissect the fundamental mechanisms underlying tumour pathogenesis and translate these discoveries into clinical studies. We have significant breadth in research and clinical facilities: UCL neuroscience ranks second worldwide for ISI citations in neuroscience and behaviour; and UCLH and GOSH treat more patients with tumours of the nervous system than any other UK centre. Aims The aim is to develop a Centre for Neuro-oncology, with the goal of being the leading European centre within the next ten years. The Centre will combine a strong core in fundamental research with outstanding clinical research and clinical trial development capacity, bringing together researchers from across UCL, the Crick and partner Hospitals. Research areas that will be developed include: epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming, multimodal imaging including molecular imaging and development of biomarkers, genomics of rare tumour subtypes, and rationally designed clinical studies linked to translational studies. Core resources and technologies will provide the infrastructure required to support this endeavor.	Cancer Research UK	NIC - Meeting Award	None	None

There is a broad consensus that chromatin is organised in dynamic loops but many questions remain about what may drive their formation, how long they are stable for and how they may alter with the cell cycle. The ? globin gene region is one of the best-characterised segments of the genome and it is an ideal model with which to investigate such issues. Analysis of single cells will be an essential complement to the genome-wide studies of chromatin configurations described in Professors Higgs & Gibbons’ programme. Our ultimate aim is to gain better insight into transcriptional regulation. The questions we plan to address are – What are the kinetics of transcription from the ? globin and nearby genes during erythroid differentiation? What are the concurrent spatial relationships across the ? globin regulatory region? What mechanisms underlie the striking decompaction of chromatin around these heavily transcribed genes? What contribution may replication make to gene regulation and also to misregulation in disease?	Medical Research Council	Unit	None	None

We will integrate research in areas of major strength for the Centre with the strengths in asthma drug discovery at GSK. The overall aim is to investigate mechanisms of interplay between allergy and virus infection in development of asthma and in acute asthma exacerbations. We will use human rhinovirus (RV) infection in asthmatic and healthy subjects to investigate roles of pre-existing/induced IgE, Th2 responses and RV infections in augmenting allergic responses in humans in vivo, alongside mouse models studies of breakdown of immune tolerance by virus infection and of virus exacerbation of allergic airway inflammation, to discover novel mechanisms where not technically possible in humans, and to investigate causal relationships with outcomes in vivo. Candidate mechanisms/drugs in GSK pipelines will then be tested in the mouse models above. We will investigate: 1. epigenetic modifications induced by RV infection in bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) ex vivo and mRNA/miRNA expression profiles of BECs and bronchoalveolar lavage macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs) and CD4+ T cells at baseline and during RV infection in vivo to identify molecules/pathways implicated in promoting Th2 responses. 2. whether RV infection in vivo increases production and affinity of IgEs against previous allergens and generates new allergen specificities (epitope spreading) by somatic hypermutation, receptor revision, class switching and affinity maturation leading to expansion of allergen-specific high affinity IgE-expressing B and plasma cells. We will determine whether RV induction/modification of these molecules/processes are related to pre-existing IgE levels/specificities or Th2 responses and virus load, clinical severity of asthma exacerbation (airway inflammation, symptoms, lung function and airway hyperresponsiveness) in vivo. We will purify lung DCs from the virus-induced breakdown of tolerance model to identify mRNA/miRNAs in DCs implicated in tolerance breakdown and determine whether these are replicated in lung DCs in the human model in vivo. Finally we will determine whether antagonism/agonism of molecules implicated in virus induced augmentation of Th2/IgE responses/tolerance breakdown in vivo, results in increased/decreased breakdown of immune tolerance or severity of RV induced exacerbation of allergic airway inflammation in mice in vivo.

Genome instability can be caused by exposure to toxic chemicals or by other genotoxic or epigenetic factors. In the pathogenesis of the malignancies of mature lymphocytes, namely the non-Hodgkin lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, chromosomal translocations involving the immunoglobulin loci are common and we have developed techniques to facilitate their cloning.||In collaboration with several groups worldwide, we continue to clone new chromosomal translocations, since although rare, these allow identification of genes that play a pivotal role in the development of normal and malignant B-cells.||Work in the lab is now establishing how the involved oncogenes transform mature B-cells. However, we are also using whole cell genomic and proteomic approaches to search for additional abnormalities, including the identification of novel tumour suppressor genes.||Since, the pathogenesis of these diseases is not known and many remain incurable with conventional chemotherapy, the molecular dissection of the genetic defects associated with these malignancies should allow rational development of new and effective targeted therapies. Our studies provide new insights in the mechanisms of development of cancer and at the same time provide new targets for the development of safe drugs.	Medical Research Council	Unit	None	None

The oncogene of Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia (APL), PML-RARa bears dominant-negative as well as gain-of-function activities leading to epigenetic changes, deregulation of transcription and ultimately leukaemogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying PML-RARa epigenetic function are not fully understood. Interaction between PML-RARa and the chromatin-associated factor DAXX contributes to transformation in vitro. DAXX, along with the DNA helicase ATRX, functions as chaperone for the histone H3.3 variant. Notably, H3.3 and its loading machinery are found mutated in human cancer, thus potentially implicating alterations of H3.3 deposition in cancer pathogenesis. Based on these findings and supporting data generated in our laboratories, we hypothesise that the H3.3 chaperone DAXX regulates APL leukaemogenesis by facilitating PML-RARa-mediated epigenetic changes. To address these hypotheses, we have set the following aims: Aim 1. To study the impact of DAXX loss on APL leukaemogenesis Aim 2. To determine the role of the H3.3 chaperone DAXX in regulation of chromatin remodelling and transcription in PML-RAR?-transformed cells This study will provide insights into the role of histone variant loading as a mechanism to promote epigenetic changes in leukaemia.

There is a broad consensus that chromatin is organised in dynamic loops but many questions remain about what may drive their formation, how long they are stable for and how they may alter with the cell cycle. The ? globin gene region is one of the best-characterised segments of the genome and it is an ideal model with which to investigate such issues. Analysis of single cells will be an essential complement to the genome-wide studies of chromatin configurations described in Professors Higgs & Gibbons’ programme. Our ultimate aim is to gain better insight into transcriptional regulation. The questions we plan to address are – What are the kinetics of transcription from the ? globin and nearby genes during erythroid differentiation? What are the concurrent spatial relationships across the ? globin regulatory region? What mechanisms underlie the striking decompaction of chromatin around these heavily transcribed genes? What contribution may replication make to gene regulation and also to misregulation in disease?	Medical Research Council	Unit	3035000.0	GBP

The homeostatic role of the kidney generates extreme anatomical variation in tissue environment (eg, oxygenation and sodium concentration), which can impact cell function. A comprehensive understanding of the cellular networks in different regions of the normal human kidney is currently lacking, and will provide an important reference dataset from which to investigate disease-associated perturbations. This project aims to address this need by: 1. Generating single-cell molecular profiles across the entire cross-section of the adult human kidney. We will perform droplet based RNA sequencing (10x Genomics platform) on single cell suspensions obtained from n=6 dissociated tissue samples (1cm3) taken from adjacent anatomical areas of n=3 adult human kidneys, spanning from the outer cortex to the upper ureter. We will profile unselected kidney cells and isolated immune cells from each anatomical region in parallel, and will use citeSEQ antibodies to enhance immune cell characterisation. 2. Characterising the epigenetic landscape of immune cells residing in different anatomical regions of the kidney. We will use the 10x scATAC seq platform to assess the chromatin landscape in immune cells obtained from cortex, medulla and pelvis of n=3 adult kidneys, Together these data will allow us to assess how different environment cues affect the potential for transcriptional activity. 3. Ascertaining the precise spatial relationships of transcriptionally characterized cells within different anatomical regions of the fetal and adult kidney. We will use RNA Scope and imaging mass cytometry to determine how kidney epithelium, endothelium and fibroblasts co-localise with immune cells. We will determine whether the survival niche for resident immune cells differs in the developing fetal kidney compared with adulthood.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	441712.0	GBP

The prevalence of affected males in the general population is approximately 1 in 4000, and that of affected females 1 in 6000. The prevalence of carrier females at high risk of having an affected child is 1 in 250 or higher. The syndrome is caused by a mutation of the FMR1 gene localized on the X chromosome. The mutation consists in an amplification and methylation of a DNA sequence within the promoter of the gene. This change blocks the expression of the gene, preventing the production of the FMRP protein, even though the coding sequence of the gene remains intact. Starting from lymphocytes of FXS patients, we established cell lines called "induced Pluripotent Stem Cells' (iPS). These cells can be differentiated into neurons and therefore represent an ideal human cellular model that recapitulates the development of functional neurons and offers the opportunity to study and understand the mechanisms at the origin of the disease. The goal of this project is to identify new approaches to cure FXS. On one side we will try to modulate the epigenetic configuration of the FMR1 gene, on the other side we aim at correcting/ameliorating the critical synaptic malfunctions. The promising results already obtained using these two approaches convinced us that the discovery of an effective cure for FXS could be feasible in the future.

The increasing number of patients being reported supports the hypothesis that this syndrome may be a common source of mental retardation. However, this genetic condition remains under-diagnosed due to failure to detect the 22qter deletion in routine chromosome analysis and to recognize the phenotype on clinical examination. As a consequence, its incidence is not yet established. Lack of one copy of the SHANK3/PROSAP2 gene, encoding a structural protein located in the synapses of the human nervous system and involved in dendritic spines formation, is very likely the cause of the major neurological features associated with the deletion 22q13 syndrome. This is strongly supported by the observation that all cases analyzed showed a deletion of SHANK3 and recently by the identification of a recurrent breakpoint within the SHANK3 gene in affected subjects. The Shank proteins are large scaffold proteins with a still incompletely understood role in synapse function. Recently, we and others have detected tissue-specific methylation of the SHANK3 gene indicating a possible tissue-specific regulation of SHANK3 expression by DNA methylation. The possibility that SHANK3 expression might be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, is very intriguing and suggests that SHANK3 expression could be modulated pharmacologically. With this project we aim to analyze with molecular cytogenetic techniques 22q13 deletion syndrome subjects, to characterize tissue specific methylation of SHANK genes, to investigate if DNA methylation regulates SHANK3 tissue-specific expression and to characterize the role of SHANK3 in brain synapse formation and function.

While blindness is an apparent consequence of vitamin A deficiency, incapacitation of the immune system is another devastating result. The studies presented investigate the role of retinoic A (RA) on the development of immunity. We hypothesize that RA exerts a profound impact on the lineage commitment of mature leukocytes. At a systems level, we study its essential role in the development of acquired immunity, and in the complex diseases of cancer, graft rejection and autoimmunity. At a cellular level, responding leukocytes will be studied in vivo at the single cell level, permitting the visualization of antigen-specific immunity in RA-replete or deficient environments. Through the conditional ablation of RA signaling, the RA responsiveness of defined leukocyte subsets will be genetically controlled in vivo, allowing us to define strict cause and effect relationships between RA signaling, specific cell type and overall immunity. A picture of the temporal and spatial synthesis of RA and RA signaling will emerge using engineered reporting mice . Finally, the genetic and epigenetic basis for how RA programs leukocyte differentiation will be determined. These studies span from the fundamental molecular regulation of the immune system by RA to the translational use of regulatory T cells to treat disease.

DD pathogenesis likely involves several inflammatory and fibrotic molecular pathways that are already characterised in other contexts, and thus a broad array of potential targets for drug development and early diagnostic markers likely exist. As such, it provides a good example of the challenge faced by researchers attempting to unravel molecular mechanism in common diseases of underappreciated functional impact. While a helpful nonsurgical treatment for symptoms of the DD has recently become available, the molecular mechanisms that lead to its emergence are not understood. Our preliminary data suggest that an epigenetic modification driving aberrant tissue fibrosis offers a potential for therapeutic manipulation of DD. relevant disorders across broader clinical fibrosis domains. We propose a feasible programme of preclinical work using existing methodologies, preclinical tool compounds and laser capture methods. The readouts in vitro and ex vivo are clear and will allow a milestone driven approach as envisaged in EMINENT programmes. We propose this as a preclinical project that if successful has potential to identify new targets and may allow repositioning of existing drugs to treat DD.

This implies a complete comprehension of how cell identity is acquired and maintained during development and differentiation. The Polycomb-group (PcG) and trithorax-group (trxG) genes encode for evolutionary conserved chromosomal proteins that control cell identity. In Drosophila, PcG and trxG proteins are part of a "cellular memory" mechanism acting on specialized DNA elements (PREs) that fix determined states on developmentally regulated genes and convey epigenetic inheritance. However, to date the mechanism(s) by which PcG act in the chromosome, remain elusive. In particular, no PREs have been identified in mammals yet. The goal of this project is the establishment of a novel model system to study the PcG and trxG function in mammalian cells. In particular, I would like to use the human and mouse neural stem cells (NSCs). NSCs have been shown to have a generalized potential in adopting any cell fate. Thus, beyond their tremendous therapeutic potential, they provide an ideal and intriguing model system to study the role chromosomal components and specialized DNA elements in the regulation of cell identity during differentiation. In addition, the completion of genome sequencing projects has suddendly provided the possibility to evaluate the role of all genes at a global level. In particular, the microarray and biochips technologies allow the simultaneous analysis of thousands of genes. Here, in order to identify all PcG and trxG target genes, I propose a novel approach combining an in vivo chromatin technique for the identification of target sites of chromosomal proteins with biochips.

Here we found that this goal can be achieved in the culture dish by transiently inducing expression of YAP or TAZ - nuclear effectors of the Hippo and biomechanical pathways - into primary/terminally differentiated cells of distinct tissue origins. Moreover, YAP/TAZ are essential endogenous factors that preserve ex-vivo naturally arising SCs of distinct tissues. In this grant, we aim to gain insights into YAP/TAZ molecular networks (upstream regulators and downstream targets) involved in somatic SC reprogramming and SC identity. Our studies will entail the identification of the genetic networks and epigenetic changes controlled by YAP/TAZ during cell de-differentiation and the re-acquisition of SC-traits in distinct cell types. We will also investigate upstream inputs establishing YAP/TAZ activity, with particular emphasis on biomechanical and cytoskeletal cues that represent overarching regulators of YAP/TAZ in tissues. For many tumors, it appears that acquisition of an immature, stem-like state is a prerequisite for tumor progression and an early step in oncogene-mediated transformation. YAP/TAZ activation is widespread in human tumors. However, a connection between YAP/TAZ and oncogene-induced cell plasticity has never been investigated. We will also pursue some intriguing preliminary results and investigate how oncogenes and chromatin remodelers may link to cell mechanics, and the plasticity of the differentiated and SC states by controlling YAP/TAZ. In sum, this research should advance our understanding of the cellular and molecular basis underpinning organ growth, tissue regeneration and tumor initiation.

The Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) is characterized by severe intra-uterine and postnatal growth retardation and typical dysmorphic features. Both BWS and SRS are caused by dysregulation of imprinted genes. Genomic imprinting is a mechanism causing the expression of a gene to depend on its origin from mother or father. This process is controlled by epigenetic modifications, that are heritable characteristics of a gene (such as DNA methylation) not coded by its nucleotide sequence. Epigenetic defects and altered expression of imprinted genes of opposite types have been involved in BWS and SRS and are more frequently found among children conceived after use of Assisted Reproduction Technology. The aim of this research project is to define the molecular bases of BWS and SRS, in order to improve molecular diagnosis, patients stratification and management, and to identify new therapeutic targets.

The spectrum of mutations (in 10 genes at a frequency of 5-90%) indicates that selective repression of gene expression is associated with alteration of histone H3 methylation at two key lysine residues K4 and K27. This global reconfiguration of expression may prime healthy B cells towards malignancy and has led therefore to a fundamental shift in our understanding of the pathogenesis of FL and our hypothesis that tailored personalised epigenetic therapy based on a patient's mutation profile may lead to improvements in the treatment and outcome of FL. Aims/methods: To achieve these ambitions, the programme has three closely integrated projects. Firstly, GENETICS will be used to define mutation of 40 genes recurrently mutated in FL tumours using a targeted sequencing approach of biopsy samples from •3 UK clinical trials: Watch and Wait, PACIFICO and GALLIUM •Sequential series of biopsies taken from patients over the course of their disease •A series of 50 FL cell suspensions This will allow us to examine the individual and combined effects of mutation on clinical outcome and accurately assess the frequency of specific gene mutations, highlighting any potential association between mutated genes and how the incidence of mutations may fluctuate over the course of the malignancy. In addition these studies are critical to inform our IN VITRO studies, focused on primary FL cells, where we will directly test how specific mutations may influence response to epigenetic modulating drugs and therefore the possibility to stratify patients based on their mutation profile. These experiments will focus in the early part of the programme on licensed histone deacetylase inhibitors, DNA demethylating agents and specific inhibitors of the histone methytransferase EZH2, which harbour gain of function mutations in 25% of FLs. How the results of this research will be used: The result of these in vitro studies and our development of molecular diagnostic tools for patient selection will allow us to develop rational biomarker-led CLINICAL TRIALS of existing and novel epigenetic therapies representing the first stratified medicine approach in FL, with patients receiving targeted treatments based on their epigenetic mutation profile.

I will overcome this situation by exploiting two biological facts. First, RNAs that are important in tissue function are a subset of the global mass, but are always associated with the ribosomal machinery and as such should be identified. Second, gene expression is the outcome of dynamic fluctuations that with time create a unique expression pattern. We need to dynamically label cell populations that undergo stress and follow them to generate a gene expression signature. To achieve my goal, I will consider: 1. Translational stress generated by viral infection or accumulation of misfolded proteins; 2. human CD4+ T lymphocyte subsets which are key to orchestrate immune responses; 3. EIF6 model of metabolic reprogramming. 1. Activation of eIF2alpha phosphorylation by viral infection generates a translational response in which silent mRNAs containing upstream ORFs (uORF) are translated. I will exploit this observation to construct the first in vivo reporter model of translational stress. We will label genetically cells that have translational stress, to identify all the changes that a single cell undergoes after viral infection/accumulation of undegraded proteins. 2. I will selectively sequence for the first time mRNAs and ncRNAs associated with the ribosomal machinery in human cells with a defined functional status. 3. Spectacular data have shown that translation factor eIF6 regulates tumorigenesis by inducing a profound metabolic reprogramming. This observation suggests that, in vivo, translation acts upstream of transcription. We will model how a short translational input results in a complex epigenetic change. Significance: a revolution in finding biomarkers/drug targets. Generate a map of predictors of the process from stress to disease. Dscriminate biologically active sequences from background.

Identifying new markers and targets with inevitably contribute to understanding of pathogenesis and inform other research avenues. With most diseases having a high degree of inter-individual heterogeneity due to the involvement of multiple genetic pathways, polymorphisms and epigenetic influences, the concept of simultaneously examining multiple proteins in parallel is biologically relevant and such data should ultimately provide highly individualised information with potetentially significant impact on diagnosis and patient management. The approaches we are adopting are based on both global profiling and pathway-specific strategies such as that downstream of the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor gene. With the specific development of the clinical proteomic profiling activities and necessary technological infrastructure and team (www.proteomics.leeds.ac.uk), the wided applicability of this activity is now being exploited to include other cancer types and clinical trials, building on the strong links between clinicians and laboratory scientists. Examples of specific areas were are currently addressing include: determining the clinical and functional significance of VHL genetic changes in renal cancer by defining additional proteins/pathways implicated downstream and their mechanistic implications; development of rigorously controlled protein profiling of clinical samples (fluids and tissue), using 2D-PAGE, SELDI/MALDI and LC/LC-MS/MS following pre-fractionation for marker discovery, both in identified clinical needs such as diagnosis, prognosis or monitoring and in the contexts of specific clinical trials such as the ICON7 trial of bevacizumab in ovarian cancer; exploring the contributions of pre-analytical and analytical factors to the inherent variability of the data and development and use of biostatistical and bioinformatic models to process and analyse the data generated in the context of the clinical scenario, both for disease-specific "molecular signatures" and to identify specific discriminatory peaks; the development and application of generic and specific validation and translational strategies for novel biomarkers/profiles to ensure translation into clincal use for successful novel markers.

The proportion of the variance in survival explained by these variables is however small. The histological predictors of relapse are hypothesized to be markers of the somatic genetic and epigenetic events in the primary. We will therefore study expression profiles in primary melanoma. The determinants of survival of patients with a positive SNB result are critically important to understand why only half of these patients, who have a demonstrably metastatic phenotype, will relapse. It is hypothesized that by studying tumours from SNB positive and negative patients, much will be learnt about the interaction between the tumour and the host. Relevance to cancer and aims The aims are to 1. Generate a tumour expression profile, which can be used in clinical practice to estimate prognosis. 2. Thereby produce increased understanding of the genetic pathways important in melanoma progression and metastasis Plan of research The samples used will come from two large studies of melanoma patients; a large cohort study and a study of patients who have had sentinel node biopsy (SNB). The RNA will be prepared in Leeds and the expression data generated at ServiceXS in Leiden.	Cancer Research UK	Project Award	None	None

Specific classes of non-coding RNA have emerged as key regulators of gene expression. For example, microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of human disease gene that is key to cancer. Specifically, some miRNAs regulate cancer therapeutic targets acting as tumour suppressors or oncogenes. Some miRNAs are prognostic and diagnostic markers of cancer. Recently, a number of additional classes of non-coding RNA have emerged, e.g. Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Using our expertise in RNA molecular biology and genomics we will continue to determine how non-coding RNAs interface with cancer biology. In addition, we will develop new strategies for anti-cancer therapies. We will continue to use the powerful molecular genetic tools available in the laboratory model organism C. elegans. However, over the next five years we will take full advantage of recent advances in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS) and organoid culture technology alongside Cas9/CRISPR genome editing to translate our work to humans. We know that “simple” Mendelian disorders can be caused by a wide variety of genetic variants, from single nucleotide mutations to short insertions and deletions to larger structural variants. A number of such genetic variants are caused by the mobilization of genomic elements such as retrotransposons in the germline. However most research into complex disease such as cancer has focused on using genetic association methods on single nucleotide polymorphisms in conserved single copy regions of the genome. This overlooks fast evolving parts of the human genome, representing perhaps 50% of the total sequence. Our focus will be to investigate how piRNAs contribute to the epigenetic control of mobile elements, which in turn regulates their mobility. Epigenetic deregulation of mobile elements in the soma might also contribute to human disease including cancer. Over the last twenty years RNA interference (RNAi) has been explored as a novel drug platform, e.g. in cancer, but RNA delivery remains a hard problem. We will investigate recent advances in our understanding of naturally mobile (extracellular) non-coding RNA with respect to cancer therapy. We will characterize RNA-modifying enzymes for drug discovery. There are 65 distinct modifications of RNA known in eukaryotes. We will characterize RNA-modifying enzymes that are known to regulate cancer-related miRNAs and lncRNAs. Small molecule inhibitors of such enzymes might allow us to target non-coding RNA pathways using classical chemistry as a novel anti-cancer therapy.

In leukemia, Prmt1 is hijacked by MLL fusion proteins for oncogenic transformation, which can be suppressed by specific knockdown of Prmt1 in transformed cells. Prmt1 also activates expression of genes,which are critical for normal hematopoiesis. While Prmt1 is an important molecule for transcription regulation and a potential therapeutic target in leukemia, its functions in normal development has not been defined. Thus the primary goal of this project is to characterize the roles of Prmt1 in normal hematopoietic development by both knockdown and conditional knockout mice approaches. The proposed research should define and give significant insights into the functions of Prmt1 in various stages of normal hematopoiesis (from hematopoietic stem cell to progenitors), which will also provide crucial information for current effort in developing specific inhibitors targeting Prmt1.

607	Dr Yuk Ting Ma	University of Birmingham	None	2005-10-01	2009-06-30	An investigation of the contribution of epigenetic inactivation of tumour suppressor genes to the initiation and progression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia	Background: Aberrant methylation of CpG-islands in the promoter regions of tumour suppressor genes (TSG) has been reported in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). However, it is unknown whether these epigenetic changes are necessary or sufficient for the initiation or progression of disease, or if they can explain the role of putative cofactors, for example, smoking in modulating the progression of HPV infection to high-grade CIN (HGCIN) and invasive disease. Aims: To determine if, a) progression to high-grade CIN is associated with a CpG island methylator phenotype, b) this phenotype can be linked to HPV exposure or smoking, or both, and c) methylation predisposes to genetic loss. Study population. 2011 women aged 15-19 who had recently become sexual active. Women were seen every six months, when a cervical smear was taken, their smoking history updated, and samples stored for virological analysis. Women with any cytological abnormality were immediately referred for colposcopic assessment, but treatment was postponed until there was histological evidence of HGCIN. Plan of research: Real-time methylation specific PCR (Q-MSP) will be used to detect methylated forms of candidate TSG in cytological and tissue samples, and to determine how often these forms are co-localised with HPV DNA sequences in sub-populations of normal and dysplastic epithelial cells isolated by laser microdissection. Chromosomal loss in tissue reported to contain HGCIN will be determined using single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, following which, cytological and tissue samples taken prior to diagnosis will be tested for methylated forms of genes that fall within the region of loss. Relevance to Cancer: This study will explore how progression to a pre-malignant phenotype can be explained in terms of the occurrence of genetic and epigenetic changes, and how these changes are in turn linked either to the acquisition of an oncogenic virus, smoking induced DNA damage, or an interaction between these two risk factors.

Prof. Dr. Karl KUCHLER	Medical University of Vienna	None	2019-08-01	2023-07-31	Chromatin Chaperones in the Regulation of Fungal Virulence	Fungal infections are unrecognized killers of mankind, since more than 1.4 million individuals die from systemic fungal infections every year. The ageing population constitutes a major and ever-growing cohort at risk. The dramatically increased susceptibility to microbial infections is a direct consequence of their age-related decreasing immune-competence. The opportunistic Candida spp. (C. albicans, glabrata, auris) are normal commensal colonizers of epithelial barriers in most healthy individuals, but they can become deadly invasive pathogens during severe immunosuppression with mortalities exceeding 40%. Candida virulence is tightly regulated by transcription factors, but also by the quality of the host immune defence. However, the notion that transcription factors of virulence genes are the sole regulators of pathogenicity has to be revised, since chromatin, packaging all DNA and its genes around nucleosomes, as well as histone modifications critically determine the outcome of fungal infections. Thus, changes in histone-containing nucleosomes, the single functional unit of chromatin, affect chromatin accessibility and orchestrate adaptive genetic responses. Indeed, host immune surveillance triggers numerous fungal responses, including epigenetic changes that engage transcription factors and chromatin in dual-layer regulation processes. Importantly, such adaptations can promote pathogen fitness, enable immune evasion, and even drive antifungal drug resistance. Of note, the genesis of adaptive chromatin states also requires chromatin chaperones such as the HIR complex, which acts in a replication-independent manner in nucleosome assembly and chromatin remodeling. Interestingly, HIR also cooperates with histone-modifying enzymes such as lysine-deacetylases (KDACs) or lysine-acetyltransferases (KATs), which otherwise play pivotal roles in fungal virulence. However, the mechanisms of how HIR engages KATs/KDACs and regulators to shape chromatin function in host-pathogen interactions in vivo remain unknown. Hence, the central hypothesis of this grant application is that the C. albicans HIR complex responds to host immune defence by modulating genetic circuitries and regulatory networks to control fitness in the host. The project is highly innovative and timely, since genome-wide approaches to dissect the function of HIR in vivo have not been conducted. Therefore, the project shall address three major aims: (i) determine the role of HIR in fungal virulence and host inflammation using mouse models and primary immune cells; (ii) use RNA-seq, ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq to identify HIR-dependent regulatory networks and chromatin states operating in vivo, including mechanisms of HIR-specific targets that control fungal pathogenicity; and (iii), use mass spectrometry of the immunopurified C. albicans HIR complex to identify novel complex components such as transcriptional regulators and/or histone modifiers acting in concert with the replication-independent HIR chaperone in the regulation of fungal pathogenicity. The results are expected to unravel novel mechanisms of how HIR controls pathogen adaptations in response to host immune defence to control fungal pathogenicity and immune evasion.

609	Dr. Stefan WINTER	Medical University of Vienna	None	2010-08-01	2012-02-29	Function of CDYL in the regulation of chromatin structure	Within eukaryotic cells the environment for all genomic processes is chromatin. This structural highly dynamic polymeric molecule is composed of DNA and mainly histone proteins. Chromatin can be further divided into transcriptional active euchromatin or transcriptional inert heterochromatin. Post-translational modifications (PTM) of histones appear as key regulators of chromatin function thereby epitomizing the biochemical basis for epigenetic phenomena. One way how PTMs impact chromatin biology is via the recruitment of modification dependent effector proteins which further relay the modification to a particular biologic effect. Methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9) is considered one of the hallmarks of heterochromatin. One novel factor that was demonstrated recently to recognize this modification via a chromodomain is CDYL, indicating a possible function in organization of heterochromatin. This factor was shown to possess transcriptional repressor activity, probably via transient interaction with a repressor complex; however the function of CDYL in chromatin biology is not yet characterized. In this project I will analyze the role of CDYL in chromatin biology via biochemical, biophysical and cell biology approaches. To this end I will determine the subcellular localization of CDYL via fluorescence-microscopy and the chromatin related localization via genome wide mapping approaches. I will accurately analyze thermodynamic parameters of CDYL binding to chromatin and effects of this association on chromatin structure in vivo and in vitro. Further I will investigate consequences of CDYL binding on transcriptional regulation in vivo. To get a comprehensive understanding of CDYL direct and indirect functions in chromatin organization I will identify and characterize CDYL associated proteins as well as RNAs. The impact of these factors on CDYL chromatin-functions will be addressed via biochemical and biophysical methods. I expect the dataset generated from the suggested experiments to significantly expand our knowledge how CDYL may participate in heterochromatin formation.

ATR is a DDR mediator that belongs to the class of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases, together with ATM and mTOR. While the ATR role in response to DNA damage has been extensively studied, its essential function in response to endogenous stress is unclear. The Foiani laboratory has recently found that ATR senses the mechanical stimuli deriving from chromosomal dynamics and that a fraction of active ATR localizes at the nuclear envelope during S phase and prophase. Osmotic stress or mechanical stimulation of the plasma membrane cause a rapid relocalization and activation of ATR at the nuclear membranes, independently of the cell cycle stage, RPA or DNA damage. Our working hypothesis is that ATR mediates a mechanical response to membrane stress that couples plasma membrane signaling with nuclear events and likely contributes to modulate the plasticity of the nuclear envelope and the perinuclear localization of certain chromatin regions. We will also explore the possibility that ATR mechano-activation may directly control nuclear-cytoskeletal force transmission required to alter nuclear positioning and/or rigidity during cell migration. In this project we aim at i) measuring the mechanical forces acting within the physiological range to activate ATR, ii) characterizing mechanisms and factors implicated in the ATR-mediated mechanical response, iii) studying how the ATR-mechanical response impacts on nuclear plasticity, epigenetic changes and cytoskeleton dynamics. If successful, the project could open valuable therapeutic opportunities for cancer, besides providing a novel view of the checkpoint response and its link with cell migration, and differentiation.

The population prevalence of affected males is approximately 1 in 4000, and that of carrier females, at risk of having affected children, 1 in 250. The syndrome is caused by a mutation of the FMR1 gene localized on the X chromosome. The mutation consists in an amplification and methylation of the DNA sequence comprising the promoter of the gene. This change blocks the expression of the gene, preventing the production of a specific protein, in spite of the fact that the coding sequence of the gene is intact. One can say that the gene is not "broken"; it is just "switched off". We showed previously that the mutant gene can be switched back on by treating in vitro cell lines from fragile X syndrome patients with drugs that can remove the methylation from the DNA and thus relieve the block of the promoter. With the present project we intend to study in more detail the mechanisms that regulate the expression of the FMR1 gene, by looking not only at the DNA, but also at the histones. These are nuclear proteins that bind to the DNA and regulate the expression of the genes. In other words, it is our aim to investigate the "epigenetic" factors that control the expression of the FMR1 gene, to better understand why and how the mutation causes its block. Our ultimate goal is to transfer in vivo the results obtained in vitro, hoping that this may lead to the discovery of an effective cure of the syndrome.

The Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) is characterized by severe intra-uterine and postnatal growth retardation and typical dysmorphic features. Both BWS and SRS are caused by dysregulation of genes located on chromosome 11p15.5 and regulated by genomic imprinting. Genomic imprinting is a mechanism causing the expression of a gene to depend on its origin from mother or father. This process is controlled by epigenetic modifications, that are heritable characteristics of a gene (such as DNA methylation) not coded by its nucleotide sequence. Epigenetic defects and altered expression of imprinted genes of opposite types have been involved in BWS and SRS and are more frequently found among children conceived after use of Assisted Reproduction Technology. The aim of this research project is to define new genetic defects, determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the imprinting abnormalities and establish cellular models to allow testing of novel therapeutic and prevention strategies.

613	Prof Kate Tilling	University of Bristol	Social Medicine	2016-01-29	2018-11-21	Development of a multilevel and mixture-model framework for modelling epigenetic changes over time (resubmission)	Epigenetic modifications (e.g. DNA methylation) are increasingly used to investigate how the environment and lifestyle impact upon disease risk. Recent technological advances have facilitated the large scale generation of longitudinal epigenetic data, and there is a need to develop statistical tools for use in this field. There are three main motivations for analyses of epigenetic changes over time: to identify areas of methylation which are more/less stable over time; to examine how exposures (e.g. environmental exposures, or behaviours such as smoking) are associated with the epigenetic changes; and to investigate the potential health consequences of epigenetic changes. Analyses are complicated by the high-dimensionality of the epigenetic space and correlation within CpG regions. We will develop multilevel and mixture methods for more robust analysis of dynamic epigenetic data. We will use MLMs to identify sites and regions which vary over time. We will compare three ways of pre-analysis dimension reduction, including extending DPPCA for application to epigenetic data. We will develop multivariate MLMs for modelling epigenetic change at several sites with respect to exposure/outcome. Current GGMM and Bayesian Mixture Models will be extended and used to derive latent classes of change across several CpG sites, and to identify the small number of CpG sites with evidence of effects which change over time. We will then develop methods to assess whether genetic variation changes over time, for example are specific to particular developmental stages. Power and performance of all methods under a range of study designs will be compared, using simulations. Data from ALSPAC and other longitudinal studies available to the co-applicants, will be used to benchmark our methods and conclusions. These data will be from 450k and bisulphite sequencing datasets, but the methods will be applicable to any application with a large number of correlated measurements.

Massive parallelisation and miniaturisation of analytical techniques now enable thousands of experiments to be conducted on a single microarray. However, the advent of these new high-throughput technologies requires a quantum leap in the statistical techniques used to analyse and study the data produced. Important scientific questions can no longer be answered by purely applying simple data mining and model-free statistical methodologies to data. Instead, novel statistical methods must incorporate prior knowledge of biological structures and processes, in a way that a human researcher might draw upon their own experiences in making scientific inferences. However, incorporating biological structure and models into classical statistical methods is difficult, if not, impossible in many instances. The objective of this study is to develop novel statistical methodologies whose features are driven by modern biological and clinical analysis requirements. In particular, statistical methodology that allows realistic biological information to be incorporated into models and produces biologically relevant inferences for the experimentalist. These statistical methods will require developments in fundamental statistical theory as well as new computational methods to allow efficient analysis. This study will utilise Bayesian statistical methodology that allows the combination of information from experimental data and prior biological knowledge within a coherent mathematical framework. The general applicability of these statistical methods will be demonstrated using data sets from two bioanalytical technologies - SNP genotyping microarrays and ChiP-chip. In the first, computational techniques to identify and deconvolve intra-tumour heterogeneity events in tumours from SNP genotyping data will be investigated in order to produce detailed genomic profiles of chromosomal alterations, such as deletions and amplifications, of the different tumour cell populations. This capability has applications in assessing heterogeneous drug responses to cancer treatments by allowing variable cellular response to be associated with particular genetic alterations. The study will also investigate the identification of binding sites for DNA-binding proteins, such as transcription factors, from ChiP-chip data. Knowledge of the locations of protein-DNA interactions would further the understanding of gene regulation and epigenetic mechanisms in cells. Despite differences in application, both technologies pose common data analysis problems that entail the discovery of certain biological events from large genome-wide data sets that are embedded within complex noise processes whose origins are biochemical.

However, an age-related reduction in crypt number and crypt cell proliferation, and an impaired ability of the epithelium to recover from injury, have all been observed in rodents. The canonical Wnt signalling pathway is the master regulator of intestinal epithelial renewal. Constitutive activation of Wnt signals disrupts intestinal tissue homeostasis in epithelial neoplasia, but preliminary evidence indicates that it also occurs with age in the apparently normal gut. Our pilot studies show that the activity of Wnt signals, and the degree of CpG island methylation of Wnt inhibitor genes, an epigenetic mechanism for gene silencing, both increase with age and vary markedly from crypt-to-crypt in the same individual. We propose that the development of increased Wnt signals along the crypt-axis reflects this age- dependent methylation of Wnt inhibitor genes. To test this hypothesis and understand the consequences for tissue homeostasis we will apply bioimaging and functional genomic approaches to a unique native human colonic crypt culture system. We will measure levels of CpG island methylation of Wnt inhibitor genes, and Wnt signals, in single crypts derived from human volunteers of widely differing age. Age- related variations in levels of DNA methyltransferase activity, and their responses to imposed molecular and cellular stress, will be quantified. We will use RNAi techniques to silence Wnt inhibitors and study the functional consequences for tissue renewal. Finally, we will build a database that can be interrogated with multivariate statistics to derive and test mechanistic hypotheses on the relationship between loss of epithelial tissue homeostasis and levels of CpG island methylation in a panel of Wnt inhibitor genes.

WE aim to understand the epigenetic changes that occur during lymphocyte responses to infection which enable immunological memory. We recently revealed that in contrast to naïve T cells, memory T cells possess thousands of epigenetically primed DNase I Hypersensitive sites (pDHSs) in key inducible genes. We propose that pDHSs leave memory cells poised for rapid responses by maintaining key inducible genes in a more accessible and primed state. Because our previous studies were based mostly on in vitro findings, we now need to determine the importance of these epigenetic changes in endogenous antigen-specific memory CD4 T cell populations generated in vivo, and identify the mechanisms that maintain long term immunological memory. We will then determine how key signals known to support memory CD4 T cell responses impact on these regulatory elements. Collectively, these studies will reveal fundamental information on the mechanisms that establish and maintain immunological memory. This project brings together three local research groups to apply cutting edge epigenetic approaches to robust in vivo models of memory responses. Our specific goals are: 1. Use a transposase-mediated chromatin accessibility assay (ATAC) to demonstrate that pDHSs are maintained within endogenous antigen-specific memory CD4 T cell populations generated in vivo and dissect how the type of response affects these epigenetic changes. 2. Use gene knock-out models to determine the contributions of OX40 and IL-7 in the maintenance of pDHSS within memory populations in vivo. 3. Delete specific pDHSs from a human IL-3 gene BAC construct in a transgenic mouse model to establish that pDHSs are required for the inducible activation of human genes. 4. Use human T cells to study evolutionary conservation of pDHSs and show that they are equally relevant to human health and disease.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	521937.0	GBP

My group is studying the molecular basis of this epigenetic control and its impact on plant development by dissecting the role that DNA methylation, chromatin modifications and non-coding RNAs play in directing relevant gene regulation at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional level. We are particularly interested in understanding how the unique combination of genetic and epigenetic information is passed on from each parent and thus have a major impact on plant performance. This analysis may provide pivotal information about how novel beneficial allelic combinations in certain hybrids contribute to heterotic phenotypic effects, or hybrid vigor, and thus improved crop performance.

Some of these diseases can be ameliorated pharmacologically or using a dietary approach. In our aging society, the need for anti-aging therapies is becoming more and more obvious and a focus point of many studies in a range of organisms, from yeast to human. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying the complex process of aging are not yet extensively clarified. Especially the knowledge on the extent and exact pathways of the causal epigenetic impact on aging is quite fragmentary, even though the existence of such impact is well documented. Yeast has proven a perfect choice for elucidation of basic mechanisms of many aging and cell death-related processes – from programmed cell death to autophagy and epigenetic regulation thereof. Yeast has also been successfully used as a screening tool for new anti-aging and neurodegeneration drugs. Combined with the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, a well-established model organism to study human development, aging and diseases due to its widely investigated anatomy and the broad spectrum of applicable genetic and molecular techniques, it makes a perfect start-up toolbox for deciphering complex and dynamically regulated processes like aging. Importantly, both organisms are easy to handle, inexpensive and robust. Here, we propose a project for systematic and near-exhaustive analysis of epigenetic regulation of aging processes and its influence on mechanisms of established anti-aging strategies like caloric restriction and spermidine intake. The main part of the project will be carried out in the yeast model. We will use established mass spectrometry methods for elucidation of significant differences in epigenetic marks appearing with progression of aging, and then assess their causal influence on lifespan using mutant strains. Applying precise ChIP-Seq technique (based on next-generation sequencing) we will reveal the downstream players of the identified causal marks on a genome-wide scale and explore their effect on lifespan. The results will then be confirmed in a fly model. As a result, even in the case of a partial success, we expect the project to yield new insights into the epigenetic regulation of aging and of pro-longevity mechanisms in eukaryotes and potentially new molecular targets for pro-longevity pharmaceutical interventions in humans. Univ. Prof. Dr. Frank Madeo, who has an extensive experience in autophagy and yeast cell death research with more than 160 peer-reviewed papers (according to Medline) on yeast genetics, cell biology, and molecular biology, will be the PI of the project. Dr. Aleksandra Fuchs (Andryushkova), who has been working on the yeast model system for more than 4 years and has extensive experience in the fields of aging, apoptosis and autophagy, will spend 100% of her working time on this project.

Significance: Cancer is one of the leading causes of death among children in the developed world. Advances in treatment have raised survival rates to 80% for many paediatric cancers, but certain rare tumours including Ewing sarcoma continue to be associated with poor survival. The discovery of epigenetic aberrations in paediatric cancers (such as changes in DNA methylation and histone modification patterns) suggests a promising route toward new therapies. Epigenetic aberrations can be reversed by an emerging class of epigenetic drugs, which are already used for cancer treatment in the elderly. The prospect that epigenetic events may broadly contribute to the development of paediatric tumours opens up exciting opportunities for epigenetic cancer therapy in children. Goal: The project will study epigenetic aberrations with relevance to Ewing sarcoma, a rare paediatric tumour of the bone that lacks satisfactory treatment strategies. Ewing sarcoma is driven by the oncogenic fusion protein EWS/FLI1, thus providing a powerful model for dissecting the interplay of fusion proteins and epigenetic regulation on a genome-wide scale. Innovation: An in vivo mouse transplantation assay will be used to investigate the regulatory networks coordinated by EWS/FLI1. This approach provides a major advance over prior research, which has been restricted to in vitro cancer cell lines. The in vivo assay will provide insights into the chain of regulatory events that lead to carcinogenesis, and it will establish an assay for pre-clinical testing of epigenetic drugs. Approach: Aim 1. Development of a flexible and tractable assay for EWS/FLI1-induced transformation Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are considered the tissue of origin of Ewing sarcoma. An in vivo transplantation assay will be established based on EWS/FLI1-expressing MSCs, which induces transformation and carcinogenesis. This model will be complemented by in vitro assays using both mouse and human MSCs. Aim 2. Identification of epigenetic states and events associated with EWS/FLI1-induced transformation Epigenome mapping of EWS/FLI1-induced tumours will be combined with gene expression and EWS/FLI-binding analysis. Integrated bioinformatic analysis of the resulting dataset will identify candidate epigenetic events relevant for carcinogenesis. Aim 3. Functional characterisation of epigenetic events contributing to EWS/FLI1-induced transformation Potentially causal epigenetic events will be functionally characterized by knock-down and over-expression of epigenetic regulators in vitro. The clinical relevance of these events will be confirmed by epigenetic analysis of human tumour samples and by epigenetic drug treatment of the in vivo mouse model. Alignment with Funding Strategy: The proposed project addresses all three aims of the Lise Meitner program: (i). it enables a scientist trained in world-class labs to pursue a research project at one of Austria’s leading cancer research institutes, while exploiting local expertise in genomic and mouse research through collaborations; (ii). it introduces a new scientific field to Austria; and (iii). it establishes a formal collaboration between an Austrian institute and a leading research institute abroad.

While it is clear that their functions are essential in all eukaryotic cells, few miRNAs have been assigned a role in specific cellular pathways. It is now clear that aberrant miRNA expression is a hallmark of tumour development, dysregulated miRNA levels are associated with breast cancer and that individual miRNAs and their clusters are human oncogenes. The specific aim of this pilot grant is to examine whether methylation of promoters controls miRNA expression in the same manner as such epigenetic changes controls gene expression. We already have preliminary data from a new tumour suppressor that we have identified in breast cancer cell lines (TLE-3) that this may be the case.	Breast Cancer Now	Pilot	None	None

Together, DNA and histone marks form an epigenetic code that holds the clues to understanding cell differentiation and lineage specification in normal development, as well as the disease states of genomic imprinting, Rett syndrome and cancer. Somatic cell nuclear transfer experiments have demonstrated that the epigenetic memory of heritable DNA methylation and chromatin states in differentiated cells is not easily erased in order to restore developmental potential, and that incorrect nuclear reprogramming leads to developmental failure. This has refocused attention on understanding the natural nuclear reprogramming process that with each new generation reinstates totipotency in the fertilised zygote. Demethylation of DNA is thought to be necessary for the activation of essential developmental genes. Rapid DNA demethylation of the mouse male pronucleus with passive DNA demethylation of the female genome in subsequent cell divisions was taken to indicate that nuclear reprogramming constitutes the global removal of epigenetic marks. This striking pronuclear asymmetry and demethylation dynamics is not conserved in other mammals, however, an observation at odds with the evolutionary conserved developmental context. Hypothesising that sperm chromatin variability in protamines, histones, variants and epigenetic modifications can explain these differences, we will investigate elements of somatic and zygotic chromatin structure that delimit the nuclear reprogramming process and determine its epigenetic outcome.

In addition to genetic variation and post-natal environment, it is becoming clear that the in utero environment also influences adult phenotypes, a phenomenon also known as developmental programming. But what are the molecular mechanisms that underlie developmental programming? Several lines of evidence suggest that the 'memory' of the in utero environment resides in epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone modifications. These modifications are involved in many aspects of genome function, including regulation of transcription. A number of small-scale studies have shown that an adverse in utero environmental influence, such as low protein, induces aberrant epigenetic changes in the foetus. These changes are propagated throughout the life of the individual, influencing phenotypic outcomes in the adult. However, we are only beginning to understand how epigenetic mechanisms mediate the effects of developmental programming, and two of the most important questions remain unanswered: (i) What are the quantitative/qualitative changes in the epigenetic landscape as a result of developmental programming (ii) Are these changes transmitted to future generations? It is critical that we now aim to provide an unbiased systems- level understanding of the molecular events associated with developmental programming. I would like to use whole- genome, systems-based approaches to elucidate the epigenetic basis of developmental programming in a mouse model of maternal low protein (LP). The LP model has been extensively studied, as it is relevant to human populations who consume low protein diets for economic or cultural reasons, and shown to have wide-ranging physiological effects, including epigenetic perturbations. It is therefore a useful model for understanding some of the fundamental epigenetic mechanisms associated with developmental programming.

Aim 2: We will develop and make readily accessible the causal analysis methods and tools and apply Mendelian randomization (MR) to epigenetic questions. Aim 3: We will use DNA methylation as an index of past exposures to improve our prediction of disease risk and prognosis. Aim 4: From neurodevelopment to cancer, there are a multitude of settings in which we can apply epigenetic epidemiology to understand disease mechanisms and predict disease. Methods: We will utilize multiple data sources; from in-house studies, via collaborations and consortia, and through publicly accessible repositories. Our primary focus will be on the analysis of DNA methylation, as this continues to be the most readily available source of epigenetic data in population-based studies. However, we will integrate these data with newly generated and publicly available epigenomic and transcriptomic data, tissue-specific data and histone modification data. A wide range of methods will be applied. These include mQTL analysis, functional annotation and machine learning approaches, such as penalized regression, support vector machines, and neural networks. We will test for mediation using MR and apply our prediction methods in disease relevant datasets. Translation: The output arising from this programme will be used to develop biomarkers of disease risk and disease prognosis. It will also shed light on the genetic architecture of DNA methylation and the causal role this molecular phenotype plays in development and disease, which will in turn inform future interventions.

Mothers experiencing stressful conditions during pregnancy or egg-laying can transfer stress hormones to their offspring, manipulating pre-natal developmental conditions. This project will investigate the long-term and transgenerational effects of pre-natal exposure to stress hormones, specifically corticosterone (CORT) via laboratory based experiments using an avian species the Japanese quail. In particular, this research will examine the role of pre- natal corticosterone exposure on embryonic development, the physiological and behavioural responses to a range of stressors in adulthood, as well as reproductive success and long-term effects on offspring quality. The objectives will be met by studying embryonic and post-natal responses following a standardised pre-natal manipulation, namely the intra-ovo injection of a known amount of exogenous glucocorticoids. Birds will then be studied using an interdisciplinary approach, combining behavioural assay with radioimmunoassay (RIA) hormone profiling, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and in situ hybridisation (ISH) techniques to track individual changes in neural development, stress axis functionality, physiology, behaviour and breeding success. This study takes a multi-disciplinary approach, drawing on endocrinology, behavioural ecology and reproductive physiology. This research will therefore provide detailed information on how early life CORT exposure could program the physiology of a bird throughout its life and how these effects could be felt in future generations. Taking such a long term approach, tracking individuals throughout their life cycle and applying an integrated approach will enable me to determine the potential for transgenerational epigenetic change in populations.

This project will exploit a situation of moderate-to-severe dietary deprivation imposed by the annual hungry season in rural Gambia to explore whether anticipated deficits in nutrients contributing to a woman s methyl-donor status result in detectable differences in DNA methylation patterns in their offspring as previously observed in animal models. The specific objectives of the proposed research are: 1. To analyse patterns of global DNA methylation using methylation-specific amplification mi croarrays and methylation of specific imprinted genes, in babies born to women who conceived at the best and worst times of the year in West-Kiang region of The Gambia. 2. To determine the nutritional methyl-donor status of women of reproductive age by measuring a comprehensive set of methyl-related intermediary metabolites (biomarkers) 3. To determine the content of dietary methyl-donors in foods available by season and to test for correlations between intake and nutritional status.	Wellcome Trust	Project Grant	359375.0	GBP

Crohn's disease (CD) results from complex interactions between genes and environment. Our preliminary data has identified differences in DNA methylation between CD cases and controls, including in genes related to T-helper-17 (Th17) cells. Hypothesis DNA methylation of genes in pathways related to Th17 differentiation and function is involved in the pathogenesis of CD and is influenced by Crohn's-associated NOD2 mutations. Objectives -Quantify differences in DNA methylation in Th17-relat ed genes between CD cases and controls in naive CD4+ T cells and blood-derived dendritic cells (DCs) and relate these to gene expression and function. -Confirm these differences seen in blood-derived DCs are found in intestinal lamina propria DCs. -Identify DNA methylation differences in intestinal epithelial cells in genes downstream of IL-17. Methods Blood will be collected from 20 ileal CD cases and 20 controls. Cases will be stratified by NOD2 genotype. DCs and naive CD4+ T cells will be isolated. Bisulphite pyrosequencing and real-time PCR will quantify DNA methylation and gene expression. Effects of DNA methylation on Th1/Th17 differentiation and function and on DC function will be assessed. Intestinal epithelial cells and lamina propria DCs will be separated from ileal biopsies from cases and controls and DNA methylation and gene expression measured.

It was found that epigenetic processes, especially changes of DNA-methylation, have far reaching effects on fetal development, aging, the development of chronic diseases and tumors. Epigenetic DNA-methylation affects the cytosines of cytosine/guanosine dinucleotides (CpG), which can be methylated at the carbon-5 position of the pyrimidine ring. The methyl-moiety is transferred from S-adenosylmethionine to the cytosine by DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyl-transferases, usually during replication. Although the regulation of the methylation process is still an open question, the involvement of the RAS-RAF-MAPK-pathway is most likely. Methylation of the cytosines affects not only gene transcription and therewith the phenotype of cells and tissues but also the stability of the genome, which is of great importance for tumor progress. Statins as well as bisphosphonates are two of the most used drugs at all. Statins were developed for treatment of lipid disorders, while bisphosphonates were designed for treatment of osteoporosis. Both drugs influence, albeit in different sections, the synthesis of isoprene-moieties, which are required to anchor the "small GTP-binding proteins" at the cell membrane; only then a proper function of the proteins can be expected. The small GTP binding proteins, which include RAS and RAF, are central regulators of cell multiplication, behavior, differentiation and apoptosis. However, because statins affect the same cellular synthetic pathway as bisphosphonates, statins may not only improve lipid metabolism but also ameliorate bone metabolism. While the benefit of bisphosphonates for bone is well established, the impact of statins on bone metabolism is still an open question. The aim of the project is to show that bisphosphonates and statins, which both modulate the RAS/RAF-signal transduction pathway, can influence the epigenetic status of cells. To show this, we will study cell multiplication and apoptosis using biochemical techniques and differentiation by genome-wide gene expression. We assume that interruption of signal transduction by these drugs attenuates the expression of the DNA methylation machinery, leading to changes in the methylation status of the regulatory regions of genes. We expect promoter demethylation of the apoptosis-promoting gene FAS, the regulator of the osteoblastic differentiation DLX5 and the collagen cross-linker protein and tumor suppressor lysyl oxidase (LOX) as well as a concomitant increased expression of these genes. By use of these drugs as well as by other inhibitors of the RAS/FAF-pathway we will learn how epigenetic DNA-methylation is regulated. In addition, recent studies suggest that the methylation status of individual CpGs is important for gene regulation. Therefore, we intend to study the DNA methylation pattern at the level of individual nucleotides and how it is altered by the various drugs. A proof that the two drugs are epigenetically active would have far-reaching consequences. On the one hand, it will lead to a new understanding of the mechanisms of action and secondly a new risk assessment will become necessary as epigenetic modifications can have long-term effects. This is particularly important because both drugs are used for a longer period and minor epigenetic changes may accumulate in tissues. The accumulated epigenetic modifications might lead to significant changes in gene expression and, therefore, might influence physiological metabolic processes.

Bronchiolitis is associated with the development of wheezing and asthma in childhood. Recent studies have found that prevention of RSV infection in neonates by monoclonal antibody prophylaxis, reduces the incidence of wheezing and asthma later in life, suggesting a causal link. The objectives of this proposal are to understand how neonatal Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection leads to increased inflammation in the lungs later in life, using a murine model. Mice infected with RSV as neonates develop exacerbated inflammatory responses to RSV re-infection, but remarkably, also to influenza infection and airway challenge with LPS. This has lead to the hypothesis, which will be tested in this project, that neonatal RSV infection leads to a long-term pro-inflammatory alteration in innate immune responses in the lungs. The broad experimental aim of this project is to understand how neonatal RSV infection leads to exacerbated inflammatory responses during later-life challenge to the lungs. Mice will be infected with RSV as neonates and the long-term effects of RSV infection determined at 6 weeks of age. The first experimental aim of this project will establish the impact of neonatal RSV infection on different types of airway inflammation later in life, to determine whether RSV infection selectively promotes or biases the inflammatory response. Th1- and Th2- driven pulmonary inflammation and inflammation in response to house dust mite extract and TLR agonists, will be tested. In all models, the extent and nature of airway inflammation will be determined by flow cytometric analysis of cellular infiltration, measurement of cytokines in bronchioalveolar lavage fluid and measurement of airway function by plethysmography. Airway macrophages and the respiratory epithelium detect pathogens, alert the immune response and control the nature and extent of airway inflammation. The second aim of this project will test the hypothesis that there is altered function and phenotype of lung macrophages and respiratory epithelial cells following neonatal RSV infection. Cell phenotype will be determined by flow cytometry, inflammatory cytokine production will be measured ex-vivo, and epithelial barrier function measured in vivo and ex vivo. The third aim of this project is to use whole mouse genome microarrays to reveal long term changes in gene expression in the lungs following neonatal RSV infection and whole genome methylation analysis to identify epigenetic changes in lung cells, which may mediate long term alteration in pulmonary immunity. This work will identify the long-term changes in the immune environment in the lungs caused by neonatal respiratory infection and identify potential mechanisms for the development of childhood asthma following bronchiolitis.

Background:Human lymphopoiesis is a dynamic life-long process that starts in utero, however developmental pathways defining fetal lymphopoiesis are largely unexplored. Detailed characterisation of human fetal lymphoid development is important because most childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (ALL) originate in utero. Hypothesis:Developmentally-regulated characteristics of lymphopoiesis provide the functional and molecular context for initiation and evolution of childhood ALL. Objectives: 1) Define site- and stage-specific characteristics of human lymphoid developmental pathways in fetal and postnatal life. Immunophenotypic, functional, transcriptomic, epigenetic characterisation of human fetal and postnatal stem/progenitors at population/single cell level. 2) Determine molecular/functional characteristics of fetal lymphoid progenitors that initiate, maintain and propagate infant/childhood ALL. In vitro and in vivo models of infant/childhood ALL using human fetal/ postnatal progenitors and primary leukaemias, will be used to investigate cellular context/key dependencies required for initiation and progression. 3) Elucidate ontogeny-related differences in the haematopoietic microenvironment in normal/ leukaemic lymphopoiesis. Molecular, proteomic and imaging mass cytometry approaches will be used to study developmental stage-specific microenvironmental niches 4. a) Integrate research findings into national and international clinical trials for treatment of infant/ childhood ALL. b) Use knowledge gained from Aims1-3 to develop adapted and effective protocols for treatment of infant ALL in low and middle-income countries.

Neuronal structure and function, neurodegenerative diseases and the influence of drugs on brain function form part of the GCE Biology specifications. Students should also be able to discuss the underlying ethical issues. We will therefore deliver workshops for KS5 students which combine “hands-on” practical experience of Alzheimer’s Disease research currently being undertaken in the Pearson laboratory (modulation of ion channels, linking to structure/function of ion channels in GCE specifications) with discussion of the underlying ethical issues, this split laboratory/ethics format being previously utilised extremely successfully by Lewis in his Wellcome Trust funded project “Performance 2012” (http://www.fbs.leeds.ac.uk/performance2012/) Following an introduction to the science/techniques, students will undertake intracellular recordings from snail brains and investigate the effects of ion channel modulators on action potential shape, duration and firing rate. They will then discuss the underlying ethical implications e.g. use of animal models, the impact of this research both for patients and Society. The workshop will run twice during National Science Week 2014 and again, in July 2014, as part of the Faculty’s Yr12 Summer School. The workshops will be evaluated using feedback from participants, their teachers and individuals delivering the sessions. Activity 2: Podcasts of Alzheimer’s Disease researchers and their research Whilst the internet is the third most popular source of scientific information, the public will only seek out this information if it is entertaining rather than an inherent interest in science (IPSOSMORI http://www.ipsosmori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/2764/Public-attitudes-to-science-2011.aspx). However, the Institutional web pages of many scientists are dry and targeted at scientific rather than public audiences. We will therefore create short video podcasts in which each applicant provides an overview of the Alzheimer’s research currently being undertaken in their laboratories (see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp9Rnt5SDI&feature=youtu.be for example from different research area) or researchers within their groups discuss their individual projects (http://www.thebiologyfaculty.org/a-levels/item/69-cloning-a-mutant-alzheimers-diseasegene). All interviewees will utilise language that is accessible to the public and therefore the target audience for these podcasts is global, encompassing all sections of Society. Over 30 podcasts will be created, which will be disseminated widely e.g. applicants Institutional web pages, YouTube,http://www.thefaculties.org/ (video podcasts by Leeds researchers on subjects within A-level curriculae), and be made available to the Alzheimer’s Society. Web traffic indicators will enable evaluation of the success of these podcasts. Activity 3: Interactive public exhibition A two day, free, interactive public exhibition on the theme of Alzheimer’s Disease will be held at Leeds City Museum in September 2014, its aims to promote knowledge and understanding of how the brain works in health and disease, showcase Alzheimer’s Disease research currently being undertaken by the applicants and promote reflection on the ethical issues surrounding Alzheimer’s Disease and its impact on Society. Lewis created and ran a similar interactive public exhibition at this venue in 2012 “The Science behind sporting success” which attracted >900 visitors (50% of museum’s footfall), generating excellent feedback: “Not really into science but the way you’ve run the activities makes it really interesting”. Hosting an event at this venue therefore has the benefit of piggy-backing onto the museum’s natural footfall, resulting in greater number of attendee’s and engaging a wider section of the community than if the event was run at the University. The exhibition will include stands showcasing the outcomes of the applicant’s current research into the causes of Alzheimer’s Disease (e.g. modulation of ion channel expression, molecular/epigenetic mechanisms, neuroprotective effects of CO), “have a go” activities on how the brain works (e.g. how and why cells die, memory tests), an ethical thought wall where individuals can post their opinions on the ethical issues surrounding Alzheimer’s disease and research, and the opportunity to talk to Alzheimer’s Society members/carers. The exhibits and activities will be designed such that, collectively, they engage all age groups and all sections of the community. Researchers and students will be available throughout to answer questions or discuss issues raised by the exhibition. Attendee numbers and feedback from attendees and organisers will be utilised to evaluate the success of this exhibition (see below). Long term sustainability of the project will be ensured by turning all resources developed into open educational resources and uploading these onto the project website enabling them to be used, free of charge, by schools and other organisations in their own educational or public engagement activities. They will also be made available to the Alzheimer’s Society. This website will be hosted for 5 years.	Alzheimer's Society	Dissemination	29872.0	GBP

Johannes ZUBER	IMP - Research Institute of Molecular Pathology	None	2013-03-01	2021-02-28	Identification and Evaluation of Candidate Drug Targets in CML Blast Crisis and secondary AML	Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are the most frequent myeloid neoplasms, with an overall incidence of about 20-30 newly diagnosed patients per 100,000/year. Although major advances in the treatment of MPN have been made in recent years, most MPN are incurable chronic disorders with substantial morbidity and mortality. The only curative treatment approach that can be offered at present is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Unfortunately, this procedure can only be performed in a small group of patients (young and fit). In all other patients, management is largely based on symptom-control and the use of growth-inhibitory drugs. However, most drugs used thus far in MPN, including the recently developed tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), have little if any curative potential. In addition, resistance to growth-inhibitory drugs is often seen in advanced MPN. So far, little is known about molecules, signaling networks, and mechanisms underlying disease evolution, progression, and resistance in various MPN. The situation is complicated by the fact that neoplastic stem cells (SC) exhibit intrinsic resistance, have multiple interactions with the SC-protective microenvironment, the so-called ?stem cell niche?, and acquire resistance in multiple subclones during disease evolution. Finally, the genetic background as well as epigenetic mechanisms are considered to play a role in disease evolution and progression in MPN. The general aim of this research program is to address the cellular, biochemical and functional complexity in various MPN by an integrated multidisciplinary approach, to exploit network analyses and resulting concepts to define critical target profiles in neoplastic (stem) cells, and to develop targeted treatment-strategies. The specific long-term aim of the SFB is to develop novel SC-eradicating treatment approaches in Ph+ and Ph- MPN. Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) will serve as a paradigmatic disease model in this SFB. In addition, the SFB will focus on JAK2 V617F-mutated MPN, KIT D816V-mutated systemic mastocytosis (SM) and mast cell leukemia (MCL), and FIP1L1/PDGFRA+ chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL). It can be expected that the SFB will substantially contribute to a better understanding of molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the etiology, progression, and resistance of neoplastic cells in these MPN. Furthermore, data generated in this SFB should provide a solid basis for the development of improved diagnostic and therapeutic concepts in these neoplasms.

Background Patients with ulcerative colitis have an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), however the colitis-associated neoplasia pathway is less clearly understood than sporadic tumours. We have previously identified p53 and K-RAS mutations as gate-keeping lesions in colitis neoplasia, and demonstrated a relatively low frequency of APC mutations. Furthermore we identified ‘mutation negative‘ colitis-associated tumours with no detectable genetic changes in APC, p53, K-RAS or p16 genes. We hypothesise that epigenetic alterations drive tumorigenesis in these lesions. We have previously shown that crypt fission is the mechanism behind the spread of mitochondrial DNA mutations in the normal gut and hypothesise that the increase in the crypt fission rate in colitis may be responsible for widespread clonal expansion of mutated cells in this condition. Aims and Objectives 1 (i).Use mitochondrial DNA mutation patch size analysis to model the rate of crypt fission in UC compared with normal mucosa data. 1. (ii) To investigate whether stem cell dynamics, including stem cell number and the rate of niche succession, are altered in UC crypts. 2. (i) Examine the genetic and epigenetic mutation burden of the cohort of human colitis-associated tumours with wild-type APC, p53, K-RAS and p16. 2. (ii) Look for protumorigenic epigenetic fields, particularly of p16, in UC neoplasia colectomy specimens Methodology 1.Using established mtDNA histochemical, sequencing and bio-modelling techniques to assess colitis-colectomy specimens for clonal patch size, clustering of mutated crypts and mathematically model crypt fission rates. We will immunostain and calculate crypt fission rates and compare with wildtype controls. 2.Tissue from mutation negative specimens will undergo molecular profiling using array CGH, microsatellite LOH analysis and image cytometry to determine any frequently detectable chromosomal copy number changes. In addition, using methylation specifiR and bisulphite sequencing in individual crypts we will look for epigenetic fields within lesions with known mutation status. Opportunities of the study By combining assessment of genetic and epigenetic mutation burden in humans and analysing clonal expansion, we hope to determine the rate at which a stem cell clone expands, crypts divide and the timing and spread of mutations in the colitis dysplasia/carcinoma pathway. We hope that this will improve our understanding of tumour development in this and other inflammatory conditions as well as searching for molecular markers to identify UC patients who are at high risk of developing tumours. This may pave the way for targeted therapy in those cases. Histopathology is the current gold standard for indentifying those patients at high risk of progressing to cancer. By examining the tumorigenic burden in morphologically normal crypts, we will be able to assess the reliability of this diagnostic method and in the future possibly use this work to provide more accurate biomarkers of tumourigenesis.

Objectives: 1. Investigate candidate genes for mutations in a cohort of non-syndromic familial renal cell carcinoma (NSFRCC) patients. 2. Perform whole exome sequencing on germline DNA from NSFRCC patients to identify novel inherited renal cancer gene(s) 3. Investigate the role of novel NSFRCC genes in sporadic RCC. 4. Initiate functional/therapeutic investigations Methodology: Initially, I will use conventional and second generation DNA sequencing methodologies to identify mutations in candidate genes in a panel of 50 NSFRCC germline DNA samples. I have already investigated two candidate genes, and have compiled a list of other candidate genes from published data, and unpublished epigenetic studies. Whole exome sequencing will be performed on a subgroup of patients with NSFRCC who do not harbour mutations in known or candidate inherited RCC genes to identify novel inherited RCC gene(s). Having prioritised candidate mutations, I will perform analyses to validate the candidate as a novel inherited RCC gene. Furthermore, I will investigate its contribution to the pathogenesis of NSFRCC and to sporadic RCC (by sequencing and CpG island methylation analysis as appropriate). Further investigations of a novel inherited RCC gene will be dependent on knowledge of the gene of interest. If the gene is well characterised and part of a well defined pathway, I will investigate the effect of potential therapeutic agents on the proliferation of RCC cell lines defective for the novel RCC gene to determine if genetic status might be used to guide targeted therapy (I have experience of using siRNA treatments to identify new targets in VHL +/- isogenic cell lines). Scientific and Medical Opportunities Insights from familial RCC have led to significant developments in the treatment of RCC. Segregation analysis studies indicate NSFRCC is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most NSFRCC kindreds are not accounted for by known inherited RCC genes. A combined strategy of candidate gene and exome sequencing is likely to identify novel genes, and to provide better insight into the pathology of kidney cancer.

HER2 overexpression occurs in 15-20% of patients with breast cancer and is associated with aggressive disease and decreased survival. Despite the advances brought by therapies based on the use of HER2-specifc antibodies (i.e. trastuzumab), the variability in the clinical benefit obtained remains as an unsolved challenge. One of the mechanisms accounting for trastuzumab therapeutic activity is the triggering of NK cell antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The robustness of NK-cell activity in cancer patients correlates with the efficacy of trastuzumab-based therapies, thus, strengthening NK cell-mediated ADCC responses becomes a strategy to improve the clinical outcome. This project is aimed to identify molecular mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity of trastuzumab-induced NK cell-mediated ADCC responses among individuals, integrating the analysis of genetic and epigenetic variables that dictate the final configuration of the NK cell compartment. On the other hand, we will explore the suitability of several biologics under development as trastuzumab adjuvants in in vitro and in pre-clinical models of HER2+ breast cancer. The influence of CD16 polymorphisms, HLA-C-specific inhibitory KIR and activation-induced costimulatory molecule CD137 on antibody-dependent activation of different NK-cell subsets will be evaluated using NK cells from healthy donors with characterized NK-cell repertoires. We will also address the capacity of i) anti-KIR mAb (Lirilumab), ii) anti-CD137 mAb (Urelumab), and iii) Sushi-IL15 -ApoA-I for enhancing trastuzumab anti-tumor activity. The double approach is expected to provide valuable information on the factors regulating the strength of NK cell-mediated ADCC that could likely extend to the context of other tumor-antigen-specific therapeutic antibodies (i.e. cetuximab, rituximab). Knowledge on patient-dependent variables underlying the efficacy of monoclonal antibody-based therapies could facilitate decisions on the convenience of testing co-adjuvant therapies, in a patient-dependent manner. The complementary expertise of the co-applicants in human NK cell biology and tumour immunotherapy, strengthens the proposal, ensuring its feasibility.

Epigenetic modifications, such as methylation of CpG islands, regulate the expression and imprinting of genes. Epigenetic abnormalities have been observed in embryos from assisted reproductive technologies (ART), which could explain the poor placental vascularisation, embryonic/fetal death, and altered fetal growth in these pregnancies. Both cloned (somatic cell nuclear transfer, or SNCT) and monoparental (parthogenotes, only maternal genes; androgenotes, only paternal genes) embryos provide important models for studying defects in expression and methylation status/imprinting of genes regulating placental function. Our hypothesis is that placental vascular development is compromised during early pregnancy in embryos from ART, in part due to altered expression or imprinting/methylation status of specific genes regulating placental angiogenesis. We will evaluate fetal growth, placental vascular growth, and expression and epigenetic status of genes regulating placental angiogenesis during early pregnancy in 3 Specific Aims: (1) after natural mating; (2) after transfer of biparental embryos from natural mating, in vitro fertilization, and SCNT; and (3) after transfer of parthenogenetic or androgenetic embryos. These studies will therefore contribute substantially to our understanding of the regulation of placental development and vascularisation during early pregnancy, and could pinpoint the mechanism contributing to embryonic loss and developmental abnormalities in fetuses from ART. Any or all of these observations will contribute to our understanding of and also our ability to successfully employ ART, which are becoming very wide spread and important in human medicine as well as in animal production.

However, even a small amount of remaining undifferentiated ES cells in these cultures would be a problem for transplantation because ES cells are tumorigenic. This proposal aims to understand the molecular mechanisms and importance of epigenetic modifications in ES cell self-renewal and in the initial steps of ES cell-mesoderm differentiation. Knowledge gained will then be applied to achieve tight regulation of transition between pluripotent cells and the mesoderm lineage in culture. For this purpose, Mbd3 deficient ES cells will be used. Mbd3 is a component of the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase (NuRD) complex and Mbd3 deficient ES cells have severe differentiation defects. In the absence of LIF Mbd3 deficient ES cells begin to express Fgf5, an early ectoderm marker, but maintain expression of the stem cell marker Oct4, without inducing the early mesoendoderm marker, Brachyury. Fgf5 expression can be reversed by culturing in the presence of LIF, therefore although Mbd3 deficient ES cells appear to initiate to differentiation they cannot progress beyond the point from where cells cannot return to undifferentiated ES cells. Interestingly Mbd3 deficient ES cells expressing an Mbd3ER fusion protein, which can be either nuclear or cytoplasmic depending upon the addition of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (4OHT), can successfully differentiate and begin to express Brachyury in a 4OHT-dependent manner. I will use this system to dissect the gene expression events that occur during these early differentiation steps. To further dissect the initial events of ES cell differentiation I will use a Nanog-reporter gene construct to isolate ES cells expressing low levels of Nanog, which have recently been shown to be poised to differentiate. Gene expression patterns of Nanog-low expressing cells in wild-type and Mbd3 deficient ES cells will be compared in order to provide molecular snapshots of gene expression patterns immediately prior to, and immediately following the initiation of differentiation. From these experiments and subsequent functional analyses, I will be able to identify genes playing important roles in the early stages of ES cell differentiation, particularly towards the mesendoderm lineages. The results of this study will be used to identify conditions under which tight control of ES cell differentiation towards the mesoendoderm lineage can be achieved.

This fact makes it important to elucidate and understand different tumour suppressor pathways in the cell that can be exploited for cancer therapy. Towards this goal we propose to study the ?tumour susceptibility gene? IRF1, which was previously shown by colleagues and I, to be a key activator of TRAIL death ligand expression in cancer cells after IFN and retinoid treatment. The induction of TRAIL by IRF1 then leads to cancer cell death via the death receptor pathway. There is still relatively little understood about the cellular pathways IRF1 controls and many of the target genes of IRF-1 remain to be identified. Two long-standing question in the field is 1) What are the tumour suppressor networks controlled by IRF1 and 2) Why do double knockout mice (p53-/-,IRF1-/-) display such profound differences in their observed tumour spectrum compared to p53-/-mice alone? We aim to answer these questions by using (Chip-chip) microarray technology to identify the direct gene targets of IRF1. We will couple these experiments to siRNA (small interfering RNA) knockdown of IRF1 to characterize its specific roles in regulating these genes. We will also characterize and then compare the epigenetic modifications occurring at IRF1 target genes in cancer cells vs normal cells. An important aspect of the proposed project is that it will allow a global view of IRF-1 tumour suppressor action and will identify where aberrant epigenetic modifications of target genes may interfere with IRF1 tumour suppressive activities. Finally, these studies will lead to a better understanding of anti-cancer networks in the cell and could provide novel avenues for cancer treatment.	Cancer Research UK	Project Award	None	None

There are few treatment options and median survival is only around one year. Sequence-specific transcription factors required for normal neural stem cell self-renewal are likely to play critical roles in driving unconstrained self-renewal in GBM. Particularly interesting are members of the forehead box (FOX) and SRY-related (SOX) families, which orchestrate lineage choice, differentiation and proliferation/survival pathways in the developing nervous system. For example, there is clear evidence that FOXG1 and SOX2 cooperate to establish and sustain the neural stem cell state. Although each of these factors has been previously implicated in human GBM, we have poor mechanistic understanding of their specific functions and key downstream effectors. Aims: We will define the specific transcriptional targets of FOXG1 and SOX2 in normal human neural stem (NS) cells and GBM-derived neural stem (GNS) cells. Our hypothesis is that in GBM the increased level and/or activity of these factors restricts differentiation, locking cells into a continuous cycle of self-renewal. How the results will be used: SOX2 and FOXG1 proteins are important therapeutic targets, yet we need to define their precise molecular activities to identify ‘druggable’ effectors. These might be direct protein partners within the transcriptional/chromatin regulatory complex, or downstream transcriptional targets. The SOX2 and FOXG1 reporter cell lines developed in this project will be of immense value for cell based screening for new drug discovery.	Cancer Research UK	NIC - Studentship	None	None

The Edinburgh Breast Unit has a large patient base, clinical expertise in the area of endocrine resistance, and has developed a tissue bank of over 2000 tumour samples with an associated clinical database. This proposal will draw on this resource and on the considerable scientific expertise available at the Edinburgh Cancer Research Centre and MRC Human Genetics Unit. The program will focus on (i) tumour profiling (ii) epigenetic mechanisms of tumour evolution, and (iii) targeting ubiquitin-ligase pathways. (i) Tumour profiling: We propose integrated and detailed studies of a) the nuclear architecture of tumours at presentation, including levels of chromatin compaction and chromosomal positioning, b) a global analysis of DNA methylation abnormalities, c) micro RNA and mRNA profiling using arrays to focus on the profiles of aromatase resistant tumours (using SNP analysis to exclude genetic gain or loss as an explanation for altered transcription, and mutation analysis), d) protein expression profiling using tissue microarrays to focus on key transforming pathways and epigenetic modulators. (ii) Epigenetic mechanisms of tumour evolution: Studies will focus on a) establishing the mechanisms through which tumour suppressor genes become aberrantly methylated in breast cancer, and b) using novel RNAi screens to identify mechanisms responsible for the development of oestrogen hypersensitivity. (iii) Targeting ubiquitin-ligase pathways: Proteomic and aptamer technologies will be developed for studying a) ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like components in breast cancer, b) the interactions of the MDM2 E3-ligase which is a key regulator of the p53 protein, and c) HERC5, a novel E3-ligase which is up-regulated by letrozole and may be a target for therapy.

One regulatory mechanism is the expression of specific proteins. Different proteins are encoded from unique DNA sequences known as genes. DNA is packaged into chromatin using a complex made up of histones, providing a further level of regulation on top of DNA sequence. Chromatin can be modified to regulate gene expression and therefore protein levels in the cell. One complex of proteins that is known to modify chromatin is called the polycomb complex PRC1. PRC1 is able to modify a histone and this is associated with gene repression. The PRC1 complex has been shown to play an important role in cell survival and proliferation, through its ability to modify chromatin. How the PRC1 complex is regulated and how it is able to recognise chromatin to modify it is poorly understood. The work described in this proposal is aimed at elucidating how PRC1 is regulated and in turn how this regulates gene expression to maintain healthy cells.

Our initial goal is to develop near-complete lists of all variants in these loci, including SNPs and structural variants in order to define independent sets of candidate causal variants using a combination of direct genotyping and imputation. In parallel, we will conduct genomewide studies of SNPs, copy number variants and epigenetic marks, using a combination of imputation and direct genotyping, to define novel T1D loci (goal 2). Our next goal is to begin to understand the mechanisms through which genes influence T1D. We will study the direct effect of these candidate causal variants on phenotypes such as RNA expression. We will exploit genomewide RNA expression data to identify additional T1D candidate genes: those which lie in common pathways with T1D genes. To support this work, we will develop statistical methods for accurate genotype calling from DNA sequencing data and for allele counting in RNA sequencing data; for selection of the variants which will be useful to genotyping in large scale datasets, and for selection of the most disease predictive variants in dense genotyping data	Wellcome Trust	Research Career Development Fellowship	630949.0	GBP

These genetic associations are well characterised, yet the underlying mechanism remains unresolved. We derived VSMC from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS-VSMC), and identified an important effect of the chr9p21 genetic risk variants; increased sensitivity to IL-1/TLR signalling, through increased interleukin (IL)-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) expression. Our pilot data indicates differential transcriptional activity, and are supportive of differential epigenetic modifications, at the IRAK4 locus, in risk and non-risk iPS-VSMC. We propose to use our iPS-VSMC to delineate the mechanism linking the chr9p21 risk variants to IRAK4 expression. We will use genome-wide epigenomic profiling combined with RNA-Seq to guide us in characterising the important regulatory elements and epigenetic processes operating at the IRAK4 locus and influenced by the chr9p21 risk variants, in anticipation that resolving this mechanism will reveal novel therapeutic targets.

Alterations in DNA methylation occur during normal ageing and play important roles in the development of disease. However, the mechanism(s) which lead to altered DNA methylation are unknown. Whilst studying altered DNA methylation in leukemia we have uncovered evidence that differentiation status may be a key controller of DNA methylation stability. Studies of paired cell lines, in which a less differentiated variant had been derived from the original line, showed that de-differentiation was strongly linked to increased methylation instability. Using genome wide profiling approaches (both gene expression and epigenetic profiling) and in-vitro mechanistic assays in this model system, we aim to identify and test potential mechanisms which can control DNA methylation stability. Furthermore we will assess the impact of this new concept of how and where altered methylation arises on important aspects of stem cell biology and human health, including leukaemia and ageing, already known to be associated with dramatic changes in DNA methylation.

For a long time after their discovery, these elements were considered to be exclusively parasitic, as they need the host cell machinery for their amplification within the genome. In contrast, research over the past decades revealed that transposon can be advantageous for their hosts by contributing to genome evolution and increasing genetic variability. However, transposon activity needs to be tightly regulated to avoid detrimental consequences to the host organism such as loss of genome integrity, cancer and sterility. The most prominent control mechanisms of transposon activity are destruction of transposon RNA (post-transcriptional gene silencing) and repression of transposon expression (transcriptional gene silencing). On both levels of transposon control, non-coding RNAs are core components conferring flexibility and at the same time specificity of the defense response. Small interfering RNAs are important for guiding effector proteins to transposons for destruction of their mRNAs or deposition of silencing marks such as DNA methylation and histone modifications. In contrast, the contribution of long non-coding RNAs to transposon control is less understood as long non-coding RNAs are produced by essential RNA polymerases in most organisms. However, Arabidopsis thaliana encodes specific RNA polymerase complexes dedicated to the production of non-coding RNAs and plants harboring mutant subunits of these RNA polymerase complexes are viable thereby facilitating the analysis of long non-coding RNA. Moreover, transposons still transpose and even vary in their activity in the different Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes thereby allowing the analysis of natural variation of transposon control. My proposed research will focus on the roles of long non-coding RNA in silencing. Firstly, I will investigate if long non-coding RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase V (POL V) in Arabidopsis thaliana guide the small interfering RNA-effector complex to transposon targets of silencing. Alternatively, I will address a hypothetical direct recruitment of the complex by the DNA sequence at target loci. Secondly, I will discover if long non-coding RNAs produced by POL V are targeting the de novo DNA methyltransferase DRM2 (DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE 2) to transposon loci. Alternatively, I will elucidate if IDN2 (INVOLVED IN DE NOVO 2) is involved in this process, as it was suggested to bridge small interfering RNA-long non-coding RNA hybrids. Thirdly, I will discover what destines a specific transposon to be a target for silencing mediated by long non-coding RNAs with the aim to reveal locus specific variability in transposon silencing. I will compare transcriptional activity, chromatin status and relative age of the transposon insertions of silenced transposons and related elements that are not targets of long non-coding RNA mediated silencing. This way, my work will gain novel fundamental insights into the contribution of long non-coding RNAs to transposon control and explore locus specificity of silencing.

Psychological stress is a well-known risk factor for adult chronic disease. Recent research indicates that nutrition during fetal development may alter hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and autonomic cardiovascular responses to stress, which may explain the link between impaired early growth and the development of adult non-communicable disease. The Mysore Parthenon Birth Cohort that I setup in 1998 has contributed to understanding these developmental pathways in India, which is experiencing rapid rise in adult chronic diseases. In the current study, through a combination of methods in multiple sites, I will measure stress-induced changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (cortisol) and sympathetic cardiovascular parameters in adolescents and young adults in rural and urban India. I will relate stress responses to neuro-cognitive characteristics, specific epigenetic changes, and psychological stress measures in them, and investigate their association with current cardiometabolic risk factors and depression. I will examine the effect of maternal nutritional status and gestational diabetes on offspring stress responses, and its possible mitigation by prenatal nutritional supplementation. I will explore the potential to develop culturally appropriate stress management interventions in young urban Indian adults combining nutritional supplementation and psychosocial measures, by understanding their views on stress and stressors in their daily life.

Stably differentiated cells can sometimes display a remarkable degree of plasticity and switch fates to another differentiated cell type, in a process termed transdifferentiation. In the vertebrate nervous system, radial glia act as neural progenitors during embryogenesis. Suprisingly, stably differentiated glia can also act as neural progenitors during adult neurogenesis. We have recently discovered two cases in which stably differentiated glial cells undergo a glia-to-neuron cell-fate switch during sexual maturation in the nervous system of C. elegans, allowing us to study these events at the single-cell level in a genetically tractable system. We will combine classic genetic approaches with state-of-the-art molecular and next-generation sequencing approaches to characterise the molecular and epigenetic changes that occur during natural glia-to-neuron transdifferentiation. We will elucidate the role of cell division in this process, identify novel molecular regulators and determine the reprogramming abilities of the factors we identify. Unleashing the neurogenic potential of glia offers tremendous therapeutic possibilities.	Wellcome Trust	Senior Research Fellowship Basic	1453931.0	GBP

R-loops are structures where nascent RNA hybridises with the DNA template strand, leaving the non-template strand unpaired. Although they have been considered for years as threats to genomic stability, I have shown that R-loops possess further beneficial features especially in facilitating efficient transcriptional termination. The goal of this research programme is to understand the different roles and mechanisms of R-loop formation in mammalian genes. I plan to firstly investigate the rol e of R-loops in pluripotency and differentiation and explore the interplay with Pol II CTD modifications. This will enable me to uncover the differences in gene regulation throughout development. I will then study the molecular function of R-loops at gene 5' and 3' ends by determining their effects on establishment of histone modifications and DNA methylation. Consequently I aim to obtain the genetic (R-loops) and epigenetic signature of the two gene ends. Finally I will explore whether specific Pol II CTD modifications influence the establishment and two opposing function of R-loops. This will provide crucial insight into the link of R-loops and the ultimate player in transcription, the Pol II molecule. To address these goals I will exploit gene-specific and genome-wide approaches.	Wellcome Trust	Sir Henry Wellcome Postdoctoral Fellowship	250000.0	GBP

In this respect the epigenetic effects of inhibitors on gene expression via increased histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling are now well known. However, growing evidence also indicates that non-histone proteins are additional targets for HDACs. Recently, HDAC8, a member of the predominantly nuclear bound family of class I HDACs, has been found to be a cytosolic marker of smooth muscle differentiation and associates with the cytoskeleton-protein smooth muscle alpha-actin in human vascular smooth muscle cells and is essential for its contractility. In this respect our pilot studies in human myometrial smooth muscle cells has demonstrated that HDAC8 is also present in these cells and is localised predominantly in the cytoplasmic/cytoskeletal region rather than in the nucleus in contrast to HDAC1. Consequently the goals of the research proposal are to define whether HDAC8 plays an important role in regulating the contractile machinery in the myometrium and to define whether highly selective HDAC8 inhibitors can perturb this mechanism and thus act as potential tocolytics.

The study will look at two environmental insults in utero for which there is epidemiological and early experimental evidence to support a role in epigenetic-mediated disease pathogenesis. The study also seeks to study the transgenerational effects of this epigenetic change through both somatic tissues and the germline. Design and methodology: A human model will identify individuals with gestational diabetes and hyperhomocysteinaemia from a local population at high risk of cardiometabolic disease. DNA from offspring cord blood will be studied and compared to parental DNA to examine de novo environmental effects on DNA methylation. A rodent model of gestational diabetes and methionine-induced hyperhomocysteinaemia will mirror this model, allowing investigation epigenetic variants and their inheritance between successive generations using sperm and oocytes and controlled breeding. In both models, epigenetic will be identified in offspring by the use of ‘next generation‘ sequencing (Solexa) and custom bioinformatic analysis. This will be followed by targeted bisulphite sequencing of familial epialleles of interest. Further study will examine tissue-specific epigenetic variants, RNA expression and chromatin remodelling. Scientific and medical opportunities: The design of this study and techniques used will provide understanding of environmentally-mediated epigenetic reprogramming and inheritance from a truly genome-wide perspective. Identification of common dietary and metabolic insults in pregnancy that may predispose to disease risk in offspring will allow effective treatment interventions against a cluster of conditions that is increasing in prevalence globally.

Epigenetics describes the regulation of gene expression, chromosome stability, genomic imprinting, and stem cell fate through inherited and acquired modifications of DNA, histones and proteins.

Ageing societies and diseases of modern living require truly novel, efficacious and safe medicines. Increasing investment in R&D has not improved the efficiency of this endeavor. There is an urgent need for novel, validated drug targets. To facilitate this, the Wellcome Trust and other organisations have sponsored large-scale genome-wide association and sequencing studies in patients, identifying thousands of genes linked to human disease, some of which may become targets for pioneer drug disco very. However, this genetic output is not widely exploited because of the lack of data and research tools to prioritise targets. The SGC was created by the Wellcome Trust to systematically solve 3-D structures of novel human proteins, and subsequently to develop novel inhibitors for a subset of these proteins (epigenetic probes). The free availability of data and reagents has amplified its impact and stimulated research in industry and academic labs. This proposal addresses the bottleneck in translation of genetic associations to therapeutic strategies. We will build capacity and infrastructure to create early discovery tools (Target Enabling Packages) for genes nominated by genetics, disease biology and clinical experts.

Defining intracellular mediators that regulate progenitor cells is important for addressing fundamental questions in developmental biology. Gastrulation is the developmental event when the major cell lineages are allocated in the embryo, and provides a good model for understanding interactions that regulate cell differentiation and migration. Although many pathways are involved in gastrulation, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-signalling and Polycomb-group (PcG) proteins are known to be essenti al, yet how they interact during this process remains unclear. I will investigate whether FGF-signalling regulates PcG-protein function during cell lineage allocation. Using high-throughput proteomic and genomic approaches during stem cell differentiation, combined with examination of epigenetic and signalling pathways during lineage allocation in the mouse embryo, I will provide new insights into the regulation of cell fate specification. First, I will investigate Ezh2-containing prot ein complexes and their target binding sites in lineage progenitors. Second, I will determine the functional role of Ezh2 in regulating repressive histone modifications during lineage allocation in the embryo. Third, I will identify intracellular mediators of FGF-signalling during mouse gastrulation and examine whether they regulate Ezh2 function. Experimental approaches to this tractable system should be applicable to stem cell decisions in vitro and other cell lineage choices later in deve lopment.

Recent years have seen substantial advances in our understanding of how retinoic acid (RA) controls lymphocyte growth, differentiation and homing. In 2008, the Noelle laboratory showed that RA dramatically enhances the differentiation of na ve CD4+ T-cells to Foxp3+ T-cells and their stable commitment to that lineage. We have recently discovered that RA is essential for development of T-cell mediated immunity and that disruption of RA signaling within CD4+ T-cells arrests the development of Th1/ Th17s. This exciting new insight into an RA dependent checkpoint in T-cell differentiation is the focus of this application. Understanding how RA controls T-cell differentiation and lineage commitment will provide the rationale for therapeutic use of RA treated cells for immunotherapy as well as the use of retinoids to modulate the immune response. Selective RARalpha agonists/antagonists are already in clinical use or preclinical development thus identification of a therapeutic role for RA si gnaling modulators has extensive translational potential. Key Goals: To determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which RA regulates differentiation and stability of a specific Th subset.

However, the mechanisms by which intestinal bacteria influence immune responses at distal sites have not been identified. Recent studies showed that bacterial metabolites, retinoic acid and short-chain fatty acids, modify CD4 T-cell fate through epigenetic mechanisms. Based on these findings I propose that bacterial species produce key microbial products that act on cis-regulatory elements to alter the differentiation potential of immune cells as they migrate through the gut. My project will address whether transient dysbiosis can permanently influence the differentiation potential of mature CD4 T cells and their precursors, favouring a pro-inflammatory phenotype during subsequent antigen encounters. My experiments will use state-of-the-art techniques and sophisticated animal models to address three key goals: 1. To assess the effects of transient dysbiosis on CD4 T-cell regulatory elements, their lineage potential and pathogenicity 2. To explore the mechanisms by which commensals regulate CD4 T-cell fate 3. To translate my findings into a causal link between dysbiosis and human autoimmune arthritis. Understanding how variation in gut microbial composition influences CD4 T-cell pathogenicity will provide the rationale for therapeutic targeting of the microbiota to modulate immune-mediated inflammation.

Follow-up of the MAVIDOS placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised trial.	There is increasing evidence that poor bone development in utero is a risk factor for osteoporotic fracture in older age. We have demonstrated in a unique multi-centre double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial (MAVIDOS), funded by Arthritis Research UK, that vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy leads to improved bone mass in babies born during winter months. In order for this result to fully inform national and international public health policy, it is essential to establish whether these benefits are maintained into older childhood. We now request modest adjunctive funding to test whether differences in bone mineral content and bone mineral density between neonates born to treatment and placebo mothers persist at 6 years old, taking into account postnatal diet, lifestyle, physical activity and health; and secondly to investigate underlying mechanisms by characterisation of bone microarchitecture using high-resolution pQCT and assessment of biochemical markers and epigenetic regulation. This study permits a unique opportunity to establish the persistent benefit and safety of vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy, and is very likely to inform global public health policy.

Epigenetic changes are ubiquitous in primary breast cancer, but less is known about the dietary/lifestyle and endogenous determinants of these changes. This project’s underlying hypothesis is that environmental factors and endogenous cues trigger changes in the methylome, that these changes contribute to the onset of breast cancer, and that they can serve as biomarkers in primary and secondary prevention. The project's three main objectives are: (1) to identify DNA methylome changes in breast cancer and surrogate tissue using a large sample of several thousand subjects from a prospective cohort, (2) to establish dietary/lifestyle and endogenous determinants of epigenetic changes, and (3) to assess the predictive value of methylation markers in clinical settings. This project is based on the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort, a study conducted in 23 centres in 10 European countries, and will use powerful epigenomic technology for biomarker discovery and validation. This study will provide unique insights into the role of risk factors in driving the epigenetic changes that are associated with breast cancer, and will reveal potential targets for biomarker discovery and future preventative strategies. Within the EpiMark project, the contribution of the group led by Christoph Bock at the CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine (http://epigenomics.cemm.oeaw.ac.at) and the work of the Biomedical Sequencing Facility (http://biomedical-sequencing.at) focuses on large-scale DNA methylation mapping in fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded patient samples as well as on integrative bioinformatic analysis of the generated datasets.

Despite their prevalence, the concrete functional roles of these alterations are not well understood, for two reasons: First, cancer samples tend to carry many correlated epigenetic alterations, making it difficult to statistically distinguish relevant driver events from those that co-occur for other reasons. Second, we lack tools for targeted epigenome editing that could be used to validate biological function in perturbation and rescue experiments. The proposed project strives to overcome these limitations through experimental and bioinformatic methods development, with the ambition of making and breaking cancer cells in vitro by introducing defined sets of epigenetic alterations. We will focus on leukemia as our “model cancer” (given its low mutation rate, frequent defects in epigenetic regulators, and availability of excellent functional assays), but the concepts and methods are general. In Aim 1, we will generate epigenome profiles for a human knockout cell collection comprising 100 epigenetic regulators and use the data to functionally annotate thousands of epigenetic alterations observed in large cancer datasets. In Aim 2, we will develop an experimental toolbox for epigenome programming using epigenetic drugs, CRISPR-assisted recruitment of epigenetic modifiers for locus-specific editing, and cell-derived guide RNA libraries for epigenome copying. Finally, in Aim 3 we will explore epigenome programming (methods from Aim 2) of candidate driver events (predictions from Aim 1) with the ultimate goal of converting cancer cells into non-cancer cells and vice versa. In summary, this project will establish a broadly applicable methodology and toolbox for dissecting the functional roles of epigenetic alterations in cancer. Moreover, successful creation of a cancer that is driven purely by epigenetic alterations could challenge our understanding of cancer as a genetic disease.

Most messenger RNAs in higher eukaryotes are synthesized as precursors which contain intervening sequences, termed introns. Differential intron removal and splicing of the exons by alternative splicing (AS) may result in distinct protein isoforms or affect mRNA stability thus affecting transcriptome and proteome diversity in eukaryotic cells. Ser/Arg-rich (SR) proteins, a family of evolutionary highly conserved splicing factors, are one of the determinants of splicing patterns present in different cells and at specific developmental stages or conditions. Arabidopsis genome comprises 18 genes coding for SR proteins which is nearly double the number found in humans. Plant-specific SR proteins are particularly interesting as they might have evolved to serve plant oriented needs. Current estimates of the occurrence of alternative splicing entirely change the way we think about gene expression regulation in plants. Approximately 60% of intron-containing genes in Arabidopsis are alternatively spliced under normal growth conditions. This number is probably higher as it does not capture AS events specific for various environmental conditions that plants experience through their life cycle. Both environmental stresses and endogenous processes can induce DNA damage and impair genome stability. Cell response to DNA damage must be tightly regulated to ensure efficient repair on one side, and to prevent unnecessary and potentially harmful effects during normal cellular processes on the other side. Research of DNA damage response (DDR) both in plants and animals has focused on the transcriptional regulation by transcription factors, signaling pathways mediated by kinases and phosphatases, and lately on epigenetic regulation. Recent studies in animals have unexpectedly revealed that splicing factors and alternative splicing are important players in the DDR. Despite extensive studies of DDR and DNA repair pathways carried out in plants regulation at the level of alternative splicing has not been comprehensively addressed. In this project we will investigate the link between DNA damage, DNA repair and alternative splicing so far never explored in plants. Specifically, we will identify transcriptional and AS changes in response to DNA damage in Arabidopsis at the genome wide level. We will identify in vivo binding motifs and direct RNA targets of a plant-specific SR protein involved in AS regulation of DNA repair. We will perform small scale comparative studies in the moss Physcomitrella patens to gain evolutionary insights into the regulation of DNA damage response by SR proteins. Our project will contribute to understanding how alternative splicing can complement transcriptional/post-translational regulation of DNA repair and genotoxic stress response in plants.

Recently, we observed that hyperglycaemia and hypoxia, two key drivers of diabetic complications trigger a sharp upregulation of LOC105, an antisense long noncoding RNA to Hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1α). Follow-up experiments indicated that LOC105 controls endothelial cell (EC) function and affects their metabolic, inflammatory and angiogenic potential. RNA-protein pulldown studies and proteomic analysis identified BRD4, a transcriptional co-activator and eIF5B, a translation initiation factor, among the binding partners of LOC105. In this study, our aim is to elucidate whether LOC105 can be targeted therapeutically to control the metabolic rewiring of diabetic ECs and determine whether LOC105 manipulation can rescue endothelial dysfunction in diabetes. To this end, we will define the role of LOC105 in different models of diabetes in humans and map the LOC105 binding domains that are essential for eIF5B and BRD4 interaction and dysregulation of the EC function in diabetes.

We have shown previously that loss of function mutations in the SCN9A gene, coding for the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7, lead to inherited painlessness - identifying SCN9A as a key pain gene. We have recently discovered a new gene from the SCN9A locus that encodes a natural, tail-to-tail, partially overlapping antisense transcript that is conserved in humans and mice (NAT1.7). Importantly, NAT1.7 and SCN9A transcript levels show a discordant expression pattern in tissues and elevation of NAT1.7 in cell-based systems causes a downregulation of SCN9A mRNA and Nav1.7-based sodium currents. The data indicate that NAT1.7 plays a role of a negative regulator of SCN9A and has the potential to affect pain thresholds via modulating SCN9A/Nav1.7 levels. This regulation can be achieved at transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional levels, such as transcriptional interference and epigenetic silencing of the SCN9A promoter, SCN9A silencing via NAT1.7-encoded microRNAs, splicing interference, RNA editing and changes in subnuclear and subcellular localisation. This regulation is likely to control the biological function of Nav1.7, and appears to be most important in tissues such as brain, DRG, and spinal cord. In order to elucidate the mechanism of SCN9A regulation by NAT1.7, we aim to answer how, where and when does NAT1.7 downregulate SCN9A expression. We will use detailed analysis of NAT1.7 function at the molecular, cellular and mouse developmental and behavioural levels in a newly developed NAT1.7 knockout mouse model. We aim to understand the consequences of loss of NAT1.7 on molecular, cellular and behavioural levels, and assess the effects of overexpressing NAT1.7 using a viral based approach in dorsal root ganglia, with the aim that this could provide a new approach to analgesia.

Myofibroblasts are the key effector cells in the development of fibrosis. PGE2 is a potent anti-fibrotic mediator that inhibits fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation however, its production is markedly reduced in F-IPF as a result of repressed cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. I have shown that COX-2 is lost during fibroblast to myofibroblast regulation and that PGE2 can inhibit and reverse myofibroblast differentiation.

ER is known to associate with pioneer factors and numerous cofactors, including many with enzymatic activity that can modify ER and other cofactors. Activity of ER and co-factors is regulated by growth factor signalling pathways. ER binding also depends on epigenetic factors like DNA methylation and histone modifications. This process is central to the physiological and pathological behaviour of the cell, but it is unknown how signalling and epigenetic determinants converge to regulate ER dynamics. ii) Aim: A quantitative model containing all major factors determining ER binding: (i) ligand inputs like oestrogen and growth factors, (ii) upstream signalling pathways that regulate ER and co-factor activity (EGF and IGF pathways), (iii) epigenetic determinants of ER binding (DNA methylation, histone modifications), and (iv) binding behaviour of ER as output. iii) Techniques: Our model will extend dynamical models of oestrogen signalling and cell fate in breast cancer based on ordinary differential equations. A Bayesian approach will rank alternative hypotheses about pathway structure by experimental evidence. We will use ChIP-seq (chromatin-immunoprecipitation and sequencing) to capture ER binding dynamics and histone modifications. FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching) measures ER mobility on a timescale of seconds. iv) Impact: This model will be the first to offer a comprehensive quantitative view of ER binding. It will lead to a deeper understanding of the determinants and dynamics of a key process in breast cancer. In the long term, our model could be used to predict the effects of perturbing components of the pathway with drugs and potentially lead to improved combinatorial treatment regimes.

It has been shown that Klf4 and Esrrb are critical determinants of ES cell identity. The aim of the proposed project is to elucidate, in-depth, the role of Esrrb and Klf4 in regulating the epigenome of pluripotent cells. To this end, I propose to perform gain and loss of function studies of Esrrb and/or Klf4 in ES cells, followed by methylome and higher-order-chromatin structure analysis. Generation of reporter ES cell lines for Klf4 and Esrrb will allow me to establish correlations between epig enetic modifications and Esrrb/Klf4 levels. The newly generated genetic tools, combined with genome-wide expression analysis, will facilitate the identification of transcriptional targets of Esrrb and Klf4. To further elucidate Klf4 and Esrrb function, mass spectrometry will be used to identify Klf4-interacting proteins, followed by functional analysis of prominent interacting proteins for Esrrb and Klf4. The proposed research will generate valuable resources (date sets) and novel biological too ls that will contribute significantly to the fields of Epigenetics and Pluripotent Cell Biology. Moreover, it will provide novel insights into the regulation of the epigenome of pluripotent cells, further improvement our understanding of the regulation of cell fate decisions.

We will examine genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation in a unique collection of samples. First, via collaboration with research groups involved in the UK10K consortium, we will undertake methylomic analysis using the Illumina Infinium 450K array in SZ samples (n=1700) and matched controls (n=1700) from ongoing genome-wide association study (GWAS) and exome sequencing projects, enabling us to perform an integrated epigenetic-genetic analytical strategy and representing the largest epigenome-wide association study yet undertaken. Specific SZ-associated differentially methylated regions (DMRs) will be verified and subsequently replicated in another set of samples using the Sequenom EpiTYPER platform and bisulfite pyrosequencing. Validated DMRs will also be examined longitudinally in a high-risk prodromal cohort to investigate epigenetic changes associated with the transition into disease. Second, we will examine genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation in MZ twin-pairs discordant for SZ using the largest collection of such samples ever assessed. This will enable us to examine the epigenome independent of any underlying genomic sequence variation and allow us to fully control for factors such as age, sex and the early (pre- and peri-natal) environment while providing further independent validation/replication for SZ-associated regions implicated in Aim 1. Third, we will use post-mortem brain samples obtained from SZ cases and controls to examine the extent to which disease-associated epigenetic marks detected in the periphery reflect changes occurring in functionally-relevant tissues. A key element of data analysis will involve the integration of epigenetic information with GWAS data, exome sequencing and other clinical/demographic data using novel methods developed in our lab.

Previously, we demonstrated that PRMT7 levels are inversely proportional to Leishmania parasite virulence (Ferreira et al., 2014). We will first dissect exactly how PRMT7 levels impact parasite virulence in mammalian cells. We will do this by genetically increasing and decreasing levels of PRMT7 enzyme and tracking parasite differentiation capacity to metacyclic (mammalian transmissive) versus amastigote (mammalian-infective) lifecycle stage parasites using stage-specific markers including RNA and protein expression, human serum sensitivity and proliferation. We will further examine whether levels of PRMT7 impact the disease-causing amastigotes' ability to infect and proliferate within human immune cells to discriminate differentiation capacity from virulence. We will verify candidate trans-regulatory RNA binding protein (RBP) targets of PRMT7 by in vitro biochemical methylation analyses and genetically manipulate target RBP levels to examine their potential role in parasite virulence. Preliminary in vitro data supports a direct interaction in which E.coli-derived PRMT7 modifies target RBPs in an arginine glycine (RGG-motif) dependent manner. If a candidate trans-regulator is confirmed to be both a target of PRMT7 and implicit in parasite differentiation and/or virulence, we will isolate associating transcripts and examine whether PRMT7 and RBP levels regulate these RNAs. Lastly, we will examine the structure/function relationship of target RBP trans-regulators in the presence/absence of PRMT7, methylation, protein binding partners, and associating RNAs using a variety of complementary biochemical, biophysical and structural techniques. We have already established protocols for production of recombinant RBPs which we can methylate in vitro using recombinant PRMT7.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	269468.0	GBP

A cure for diabetes depends on replacing the insulin-producing ?-cells in the pancreas that are destroyed by the disease. An attractive strategy to attain this goal is to convert liver adult cells of the same patient into pancreatic ?-cells. The liver and pancreas share many aspects of their early development and are specified in adjacent regions of the endoderm, possibly from a common bipotent progenitor cell. Therefore, conversion of liver to pancreas is conceivable and should imply only few steps backward to a common progenitor and little epigenetic changes. However, how pancreatic versus hepatic fate decision occurs during development is still poorly understood. The aim of this proposal is two fold: to perform lineage analysis, and to study developmental regulators of pancreatic versus hepatic fate decision. We will use new genetic tools, based on the GFP and photoconvertible Kaede fluorescent proteins, to address: i. if the liver and pancreas arise from a common bipotent progenitor cell; ii. to trace in vivo; and iii. molecularly profile the presumptive precursor cell and its descendants in the mouse embryo. Our previous studies have identified target genes of the GATA factors that might act as intrinsic developmental regulators of the pancreatic versus hepatic fate decision. Both intrinsic factors together with extrinsic regulators, such as BMP, will be studied. We will test their potential to promote lineage reprogramming of liver to pancreas using the mouse as well as mouse embryonic stem cells as model systems. Understanding how distinct cell types arise from common multipotent progenitor cells is a major quest in developmental biology. Our findings will elucidate the spatiotemporal mechanisms that control pancreas versus liver fate decision. In addition, they will provide the blueprint for lineage reprogramming of adult hepatic cells to pancreas in diabetes cell-therapy.	European Research Council	Starting Grant	1186746.0	EUR

We will investigate several properties of this novel signaling pathway in the CNS and how it can shed light on brain development and physiology, also neurological and psychiatric pathologies. The studies will concentrate on 4 HPs (Engrailed1/2, Otx2 and Pax6) illustrative of the HP family and of high physiological interest. Mouse lines will be developed in which the extracellular expression of single chain antibodies against these HPs can be induced at specific places and times, allowing us to follow the consequences of neutralizing extracellular HPs while preserving their cell autonomous functions. With this tool (and others) we shall study if (and how) HP transfer regulates boundary position in the neuroepithelium and direct cell/axon migration and guidance. In postnatal development, we will dissect how Otx2 regulates the opening, closure and reopening of critical periods in the cortex and controls the behavior of neuronal networks throughout life. Also in the adult we will follow how HPs regulate the physiology and survival of distinct neuronal groups, including midbrain dopaminergic neurons. We shall analyze the physiological interactions between HPs and classical signaling molecules and identify HP targets, in particular those regulating the cell energy metabolism, and explore their ability to modulate the epigenetic state of the chromatin. Using Otx2 and Engrailed as baits, we shall identify the complex sugars with which they interact at the cell surface to get an entry into the "sugar code" that confers specificity to HP capture by distinct cell populations. This project should identify new HP functions and highlight them as part of a major mode of signal transduction in the developing and mature CNS. It is expected that this will modify the way we look at many developmental, evolutionary and physiological mechanisms.	European Research Council	Advanced Grant	2499995.0	EUR

The high degree of genome variation exhibited both on the population level as well as between genetically "identical" cells (even in the same organ) makes genetic and epigenetic analysis on the single cell and single genome level a necessity. Chromosomes may be conceptually represented as a linear one-dimensional barcode. However, in contrast to a traditional binary barcode approach that considers only two possible bits of information (1 & 0), I will use colour and molecular structure to expand the variety of information represented in the barcode. Like colourful beads threaded on a string, where each bead represents a distinct type of observable, I will label each type of genomic information with a different chemical moiety thus expanding the repertoire of information that can be simultaneously measured. A major effort in this proposal is invested in the development of unique chemistries to enable this labelling. I specifically address three types of genomic variation: Variations in genomic layout (including DNA repeats, structural and copy number variations), variations in the patterns of chemical DNA modifications (such as methylation of cytosine bases) and variations in the chromatin composition (including nucleosome and transcription factor distributions). I will use physical extension of long DNA molecules on surfaces and in nanofluidic channels to reveal this information visually in the form of a linear, fluorescent "barcode" that is read-out by advanced imaging techniques. Similarly, DNA molecules will be threaded through a nanopore where the sequential position of "bulky" molecular groups attached to the DNA may be inferred from temporal modulation of an ionic current measured across the pore.

Unmasking the interplay between different genomic features is critical for understanding the operating system of life. Specifically, revealing long-range epigenetic regulation may uncover predisposition to cancer. Nevertheless, due to the short read-length of single-cell next-generation sequencing, there is no method today that can integrate multiple genomic observables, on the same genome and at the same time. The missing picture constitutes a major genomic “blind spot”, obscuring epigenetic regulation of gene expression. This project aims to provide a multiplexed view of the genome never before accessible. I will utilize single-molecule physical and chemical mapping of individual chromosomes to discover long-range epigenetic correlations, focusing on markers for predisposition to breast cancer. I will approach multiplexing by applying optical and electrical sensing concepts to detect chemical tags attached to long genomic DNA molecules. Equipped with a toolbox of biochemical DNA labeling reactions, I will develop a unique spectral imager for simultaneous acquisition of high-content genomic information from DNA stretched in nanochannel arrays. DNA tagging will also be used to enhance electrical contrast for nanopore epigenetic sequencing. Finally, by combining electric sensing inside nanochannels I will develop new integrated devices for electro-optical genomic analysis. Together, these developments cover the full range of genomic length scales and resolution. MultiplexGenomics will establish a groundbreaking experimental framework for genetic/epigenetic profiling of native chromosomal DNA. A successful completion of this project will make possible the discovery of novel control networks and hidden long-range regulation, opening new horizons for basic genomic research and personalized medicine.

It afflicts 80% of cancer patients and accounts for 25-30% cancer deaths. There are currently no effective treatments for muscle wasting in cancer. Myostatin is a member of the transforming growth factor-beta family, and a negative regulator of muscle mass, over-expressed in cachexia. Previous reports show that pharmacological blockade of the myostatin/activin receptor (ActRIIB) completely reverses loss of skeletal muscle and dramatically prolongs survival. Our preliminary data show that the Bromodomain protein BRD4 modulates myostatin and atrogin transcription. The small molecule JQ1 is an epigenetic drug that blocks bromodomain-containing proteins and reduces tumor progression in mouse models of cancer. We found that treatment of myotubes with JQ1 decreases levels of myostatin and muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases and results in myotubes protection from induced-atrophy, in a cell-culture model. Thus, we hypothesize that an epigenetic therapy based on BRD4 pharmacological blockade in the mouse may result in abrogation of myostatin signaling, decrease in muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases expression, and alleviate the catabolic effects of cachexia. To test this hypothesis, we will evaluate whether BRD4 pharmacological blockade by JQ1 restores muscle function, using an established mouse model of cancer cachexia. We will evaluate weight loss and survival in tumor-bearing mice treated with JQ1. We will examine the impact of JQ1 treatment on primary skeletal muscle stem cells and investigate how JQ1 modifies the expression profile of muscles, and elucidate catabolic molecular mechanisms altered by JQ1 treatment. This proposal attempts to validate an epigenetic therapeutic strategy for muscle wasting by decreasing myostatin and the muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases, in a mouse model of cancer cachexia. If successful, it may provide the rationale for the use of JQ1 in cancer cachexia treatment and/or show how JQ1 administration to block progression of certain cancers may concurrently reverse cancer cachexia.

We have identified a new core histone variant H2A.W that occupies the major portion of the condensed heterochromatin in plants. Heterochromatin is a key feature that is essential for genome integrity through repression of transposons and for transmission through cell division because of the link between heterochromatin and the mitotic kinetochores. We showed that H2A.W is largely responsible for organization of heterochromatin into higher order dense chromocenters but do not know the mechanisms involved. Our major objectives are to unravel the function of H2A.W, to assess its impact on chromatin and to identify mechanisms that target H2A.W to heterochromatin. Our preliminary work showed that complete removal of H2A.W causes lethality and partial chromic depletion of H2A.W is counteracted by DNA methylation, thus obscuring the primary function of H2A.W. In order to address the function of H2A.W we propose a series of strategies to remove H2A.W in a transient manner either by reducing the amount of transcripts or by using a novel approach to remove the functional domain of H2A.W after its incorporation into the chromatin. The impact of the transient loss of function of H2A.W will be assessed using genome wide profiling to record changes in a variety of chromatin and epigenetic marks. In addition, the impact on chromatin structure will be monitored in vivo using state-of-the art microscopy. To identify how H2A.W is targeted to heterochromatin we will combine genetic and biochemical strategies. In parallel we will use affinity purification/mass spectrometry approach to identify proteins binding to H2A.W in the cytoplasm and in the heterochromatin. Two genetic screens will identify mutants in genes involved in H2A.W dynamics and its function in organizing larger functional heterochromatin domains. Altogether the project will enhance our understanding of the mechanisms that participate to heterochromatin function and to its organization into higher order functional domains.

We propose to develop methods to access Arabidopsis male germ line cells.

This knowledge will be combined with studying new genetic material impaired in proper male germ line development from our Japanese collaborators to identify key transcription factors and their associated network. Profiles of chromatin components that experience profound dynamic changes will be projected to the transcriptional networks to evaluate the degree of control exerted by epigenetic mechanisms in germl ine development.

The Pacific Biosciences RS II SMRT Sequencing System provides the highest consensus accuracy and longest read lengths of any sequencing technology; current average read-lengths are >8.5kb (with a maximum of ~50kb). SMRT sequencing will facilitate advances in disease characterisation, stratification and diagnosis via its unique utility for de novo assembly across highly complex regions of the genome, targeted re-sequencing, long-range phasing of genetic variation, and epigenomic analysis via the direct allele-specific detection of modified DNA bases. We will also develop our High-Performance Computing/Informatics Infrastructure to enable the storage, analysis, alignment, and assembly of SMRT sequencing data. This infrastructure investment will enable the world-leading genetic and epigenetic research groups at the University of Exeter Medical School to further develop their innovative program of clinical genomic research in human disease, with a specific focus on diabetes and neurological phenotypes.

To unravel in an unbiased and comprehensive manner the biological function of LSD1 in physiology and pathology, we developed LSD1-deficient and LSD1-transgenic mouse models. LSD1-transgenic animals develop prostate tumours demonstrating that increased expression of LSD1 suffices for oncogenic growth in vivo. In addition, LSD1-transgenic animals exhibit a metabolic shift towards overt obesity in adulthood. LSD1-deficiency causes early embryonic lethality around day 7.5 of development. However, deletion of LSD1 is not essential for the development of the embryo proper until the onset of gastrulation, suggesting that the early embryonic lethality is caused by trophoblast defects. Indeed, our data demonstrate that LSD1 is crucial for maintaining trophoblast stem cells in their niche and required for the specification of trophoblast stem cell fate during initial steps of differentiation. To identify the underlying mechanisms that allow LSD1 to control a wide range of biological systems such as trophoblast stem cell fate in the early embryo, obesity, and prostate tumourigenesis in the adult, we propose to a) identify LSD1-associated protein complexes and b) LSD1 target genes establishing these phenotypes in the mouse. In addition, we shall uncover c) signalling pathways that modify LSD1 in these phenotypes allowing us to explore the therapeutic potential of targeting these signalling pathways.

In principle this response could be built on: i) multiple clones, each performing a given function; ii) multiple functions performed by distinct descendants of a single clone; or, iii) any combination of the two. For this reason, understanding the distribution of antigen-specific T cell clones within effector and memory subsets is of both fundamental and practical importance. This proposal is centered on fundamental questions that pertain to T lymphocyte functions in protection and pathology. We aim at defining the lineage relationship between different memory T cell subsets and between T helper cells with polarized or mixed cytokine profiles, and the natural and therapeutic plasticity of effector and memory T cells at different stages of differentiation. The proposal builds on our knowledge of human T cell differentiation and on the identification of different types of effector and memory T cell subsets, as well as on our early studies on the epigenetic control of human CD4 T cell polarization and plasticity. We will take advantage of multiparametric flow cytometry and cell sorting, high throughput T cell cloning, and next generation sequencing to analyse the human antigen-specific immune response at the clonal level. The project is organized in two main subprojects. The first will address the distribution of memory and effector T cells within individual expanded clones of antigen-specific T cells primed in vivo by different classes of antigens. We will establish, at the clonal level, the lineage relationship of effector and memory T cell subsets, such as T cells producing IFN-?, IL-4, IL-17 and IL-22, alone or in different combinations, or circulating follicular helper T cells and central memory and effector memory T cells. The second subproject will address at the molecular level the mechanisms of T cell differentiation and plasticity that control expression of effector cytokines. The hypotheses tested are strongly supported by preliminary observations from our own laboratory as well as from the biomedical literature. We expect that these studies will significantly expand our basic understanding of T cell biology and will have translational implications for vaccination and immunotherapy.

However, the identity of the cells that promote metastasis is unknown, hampering our ability to develop therapies to inhibit the spread of tumours to distant sites. We have identified the cells responsible for the formation of metastasis in different types of tumours. These cells have intriguing characteristics: i) they are exclusive in their ability to generate metastases; ii) they express the fatty acid translocase CD36, and are characterized by a unique lipid metabolic signature; iii) they are exquisitely sensitive to the levels of fat in circulation, and consequently, they relate the predisposition of metastasis directly to the content of dietary fat; iv) they are highly sensitive to CD36 inhibition, which almost completely abolishes their metastatic potential. However, we still do not know the mechanism of action of CD36+ metastatic-initiating cells. In particular, why are they sensitive to dietary lipids? Are they equally responsive to all types of fatty acids? What are the molecular and cellular mechanisms of action underlying pro-metastatic lipids? Can dietary lipids have long-term (epigenetic) effects over the predisposition to develop metastasis? Based on this, we propose to identify which dietary fatty acids promote metastasis, and their mechanism of action. We believe this is relevant, considering the high concentration of saturated fatty acids present in the diet consumed in industrialized countries. We will combine metastatic orthotopic models using modified diets, with state-of-the-art quantitative metabolomics, proteomics, epigenetic studies, and bioinformatic analyses, using preclinical models and patient-derived samples of oral carcinoma. We will also test clinical grade CD36 neutralizing antibodies we are generating in collaboration with a company (UK), in preclinical models of human oral carcinoma, and possibly other tumors, all of which are sensitive to CD36-based metastatic inhibition. We aim to identify candidate clinical-grade antibodies to subsequently test in clinical trials.	Worldwide Cancer Research	Project Grant	208334.0	GBP

Affected patients suffer from progressive muscle weakness and degeneration. To date there is no effective cure for DMD, although promising cellular, viral, and pharmacological approaches are under investigation for successful therapies. A newly emerged strategy to alleviate the symptoms of DMD is to increase of muscle mass (muscle hypertrophy) by inhibition of myostatin, a protein that limits muscle growth. Mice lacking myostatin show distinct muscle hypertrophy, known as “double muscling phenotype”. Myostatin blockade leads to an increase in muscle size and may ameliorate the function of the dystrophic muscle. Several research groups are attempting to reduce myostatin levels by different approaches. Our data show that a protein called BRD4 activates transcription of the myostatin gene. Recently, the BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 was developed to block BRD4 function. JQ1 treatment determines an increase in myotubes size and a decrease in myostatin levels, in a cell culture model. We will study the effect of JQ1 in a mouse model of DMD, the mdx mouse. We will evaluate whether JQ1 treatment results in an increase in myofibers size and whether JQ1 helps the restoration of muscle function in the mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. JQ1 is currently considered an anti-tumoral drug, but it may become a promising therapeutic agent to contrast muscle loss in diseases associated to muscle degeneration and wasting, as DMD.

When the host immune system is impaired, the obligatory diploid C. albicans fungus can switch from a commensal colonizer to a serious invasive human pathogen, causing mucosal infections, as well as life-threatening invasive diseases. With the increase of susceptible immunocompromised populations, C. albicans infections constitute a global healthcare problem. Given its public health importance, it is vital to study the pathogenesis of C. albicans and their interaction with the host immune system. C. albicans can switch between several different growth morphologies, which enable them to better adapt to fluctuating host environments and promote or favour infections and invasive diseases. Recently, we have demonstrated that the ability to switch from white (W) to the opaque (O) morphology phase is a common characteristic of C. albicans in all the three known mating type loci (MTL) types. The two phases vary greatly in morphology, gene expression and virulence. However, we have very limited knowledge about why the MTL heterozygous strains can undergo white-opaque (W/O) switching, since they are otherwise mating incompetent. Therefore, the major aim of this project is to decipher the role of W/O switching in the interaction between C. albicans and innate immune phagocytes at the cellular and molecular level. Innate immune cells including macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils are the first line of host defense against invasive candidiasis. We hypothesize that the W and O cells of C. albicans interact differently with these phagocytes, leading to a distinct output driving T cell polarization and thus adaptive immunity. The W and O cells of a/? isolates express a number of different genes including cell wall components, metabolism and stress response genes, which are implicated in the recognition, engulfment and elimination by immune cells. So we hypothesize that the intrinsic differences between morphogenetic phases of C. albicans are attributed to the different interactions with host immune cells. Since the genomes of W cells and O cells are identical, epigenetic regulation of gene expression by modified and remodeled chromatin may account for the different phenotypes seen in W and O cells. Thus, we believe that chromatin alterations induced by host interaction may affect cell wall structure and homeostasis in different morphologies of C. albicans, leading to different responses to the host, which may even promote immune evasion. Furthermore, chromatin proteins associated with virulence are promising alternative targets for new anti-fungal drugs. Therefore, our work will shed new light on the molecular principles governing host-fungal interactions and virulence of C. albicans, and may possibly pave the way for new antifungal strategies against this important human fungal pathogen.

This progress has established the view that gametes are hyper-differentiated cell types with highly specific transcriptional profiles. Advances in microscopy based on fluorescent reporters and live cell imaging have also transformed research capability and provided insights into the mechanisms involved in gamete delivery, interaction and the reprogramming of chromatin. Yet, our understanding of the complexity of double fertilization that characterises flowering plants is far from complete. Importantly, we lack any knowledge on the origin of mechanisms that predate double fertilization. Here, we propose to use emerging models, representing key stages in plant evolution, to provide insight into the ancestral mechanisms of gamete differentiation and fertilization. We will establish gene co-function networks by generating expression atlases for the liverwort Marchantia, the moss Physcomitrella and the extant basal flowering plant Amborella. These will be complemented with cofunction networks from Arabidopsis and the important crops maize, tomato and rice. The green alga Chlamydomonas will serve as an outgroup. These networks will be used to study the conservation of gene co-function networks governing male and female gametogenesis, pollen tube growth and fertilization mechanisms in flowering plants. Moreover, these investigations will provide novel molecular markers of fertility in crops. We aim to identify, for example, fertilization factors which were lost from ancient angiosperms during the evolution of monocots (grasses) and eudicots and those which have evolved de novo in the angiosperm lineage. We will also directly test the function of established regulators required for male gamete development, as well as those newly identified from our network analyses, to assess the extent of evolutionary conservation of these regulatory networks. The expected findings will allow the identification of specific mechanisms that are targeted by environmental stresses during sexual reproduction in crops and will assist in the selection of stressresistant cultivars. Finally, the reprogramming of chromatin modifications is an established feature of sexual reproduction in animals. Data generated in this project will provide the first comprehensive map of the occurrence of chromatin reprogramming in plant gametes and fertilization products. A better understanding of the epigenetic reprogramming events is pivotal for understanding transgenerational inheritance of epigenetic marks following exposure to biotic and abiotic stress and thus is an essential component for the improvement of crop productivity under environmental changes. In summary, the outputs of the EVOREPRO project will provide a deeper understanding of the evolution of sexual reproduction of economically important plant species.

There are many unmet clinical needs regarding the management of prostate cancer including more specific tests to identify individuals who need to undergo prostate biopsy and improved risk stratifying of patients with early prostate cancer needing direct therapy. Epigenetic changes play a more significant role in early tumour development than previously thought. Hypermethylation patterns, a marker of epigenetic change, of tumour suppressor genes may provide useful risk stratification for patients with early tumours. Hypermethylation of secreted Wnt antagonist genes has been demonstrated in a wide range of tumours, indicating that silencing is a common feature of solid tumourigenesis. Silencing of the Wnt antagonists has been reported in prostate cancer as well. Aims: The purpose of this project is to analyse epigenetic changes in secreted Wnt antagonist genes that occur in prostate cancer and to determine whether these events can be exploited to provide supplementary biomarkers for prostate cancer staging and prognosis. How the results of this project will be used: If this preliminary study shows promising evidence, the data will be used to expand our research into the role of epigenetic changes in prostate cancer with a follow-up project.

In the intestine and stomach, organs with extensive self-renewal, Lgr5 marks adult stem cell populations that are constantly cycling. In the liver, an organ with limited cellular turnover but huge regenerative capacity, Lgr5 is not detected under physiological conditions. However, marks a new stem/progenitor cell population that gets activated upon damage and contributes to restore the tissue and reinstall homeostasis. The main goal of this proposal is to understand the molecular mechanisms, t hat following tissue damage, regulates the transition of adult liver cells from a quiescent to an activated state, from the role of the niche during this transition to the epigenetic changes triggering this activation. The main focus of this research plan will be: Plan1) Identify the quiescent cell/s that become activated cells during damage-regeneration; Plan2) Elucidate the niche for activated stem cells; Plan3) Identify the gene regulation mechanisms (epigenetic) involved in liver stem cell activation following damage. As liver disease and liver cancer are highly associated to liver damage, understanding the mechanism regulating stem cell activation holds promise to extend our knowledge not only of liver regeneration but also of liver disease and cancer.

It not only serves to condense the genomic content into restricted space, but mainly to encode epigenetic traits ensuring temporally controlled and balanced transcription of genes and coordinated DNA replication and repair. The non-random three-dimensional chromatin architecture including looped structures between genomic control elements relies on the action of architectural proteins. However, despite increasing interest in spatio-temporal chromatin organization, mechanistic details of their contributions are not well understood. With this proposal I aim at unveiling molecular mechanisms of protein-mediated chromatin organization by in vivo single molecule tracking and quantitative super-resolution imaging of architectural proteins using reflected light sheet microscopy (RLSM). I will measure the interaction dynamics, the spatial distribution and the stoichiometry of architectural proteins throughout the nucleus and at specific chromatin loci within single cells. In complement single molecule force spectroscopy experiments using magnetic tweezers (MT), I will study mechanisms of DNA loop formation in vitro by structure-mediating proteins. Integrating these spatio-temporal and mechanical single molecule information, I will in the third sup-project measure the dynamics of relative end-to-end movements and the forces acting within a looped chromatin structure in living cells. Taken together, my experiments will greatly enhance our mechanistic understanding of three-dimensional chromatin architecture and inspire future experiments on its regulatory effects on nuclear functions and potential therapeutic utility upon controlled modification.

Within a tumor, cancer cells may present different histological features, proliferation, invasion, metastatic potential, as well as differences in their sensitivity to medical therapy. The phenotypic and functional heterogeneity is thought to depend on genetic and non-genetic changes occurring in tumor initiating cells. In this project, using state of the art genetic and lineage tracing approaches in mice, we will define how the cellular origin, the genetic, epigenetic and transcriptional changes control the heterogeneity of skin squamous cell carcinoma, and its importance for tumor maintenance, progression, metastasis, and response to medical therapy. The results of this project will be fundamentally important for our understanding of the basic mechanisms regulating tumor heterogeneity and will have important implications for cancer therapy and personalized medicine.

Cancer is a clonal disease originating from a single cell. Yet, most human cancers are characterized by astounding intra-tumour heterogeneity and comprise various subpopulations of cells with distinct phenotypes and biological properties. Even neighbouring cells within a tumour may have different morphologies, express differential transcriptional programs and display specific repertoires of surface molecules. Most importantly, not all cancer cells possess the same proliferative potential and in most cancers only a subset of cells is truly immortal. These cells act as CSCs and are responsible for maintaining the long-term growth of the tumour. This group is interested in understanding how epigenetic mechanisms involving histone modifications, higher-order chromatin structure and DNA methylation contribute to intra-tumour heterogeneity and how they affect CSC function. State-of-the-art molecular and cell biological methods in combination with advanced light microscopy techniques and in vivo approaches are used to characterize functionally important epigenetic traits of CSCs, with the ultimate goal of identifying novel therapeutic targets.

Despite tremendous advances on PRC2 function, many open questions remain that hamper a full understanding of its role in controlling gene expression. Particularly, the effects of the histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) mark placed by PRC2 remain largely elusive, with but few exceptions. My recent work further demonstrated that H3K27me3 occurs in both symmetric and asymmetric conformations within nucleosomes, providing a novel, virtually unexplored parameter for its function. Building on these findings, I will analyse how symmetric and asymmetric H3K27me3 affects the placement of active histone marks and how H3K27me3 functions and contributes to plasticity at the so-called bivalent domains, chromatin domains that poise expression of developmental genes. Moreover, to address whether H3K27me3 can function to maintain chromatin and thus gene expression states through replication and cell division, I will chart the asymmetry of this mark throughout the cell cycle to gain insig ht into loss and gain of this mark during replication. I will further employ fluorescence microscopy approaches to trace the fate of PRC2 during mitosis and to resolve whether it is instructive to gene expression patterns or secondary to the action of transcription factors in restarting gene expression.

The knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis of T21 is poor (even after 50 years from the discovery of T21 by Jerome Lejeune), and does not yet allow effective treatment of this common genomic abnormality. Many advances of the last 10 years, however, provide a reasonable enthusiasm for the understanding of this common, and yet “orphan” disease. These advances include the i) completion of the high quality DNA sequence of the 33,5 Mb long arm of chromosome 21 (HSA21), ii) the sequence of additional mammalian genomes that allows the description of the various evolutionary conserved and functional components of the genome; iii) the description of the common polymorphic variability of the human genomes and the appreciation of the individuality of gene expression variation, iv) the development of high throughput methods for genome analysis, v) the recent advances in high throughput sequencing, vi) the advances in computational biology, vii) the capability of producing induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS), viii) and the use of mouse and other models. The elucidation of the molecular pathogenesis of the multiple, heterogeneous, and variable T21 phenotypes will also be of importance in the understanding of many other genetic disorders due to genomic dosage imbalance.In this grant application we propose to continue the functional genome analysis of HSA21, characterize the molecular basis of one of the most characteristic and tractable phenotypes of T21, and explore the power of stem cell biology to understand the cellular specificity of the genome dysfunction due to the supernumerary HSA21.The specific aims of the proposal are to:1) Discover the molecular basis of the Congenital Heart Defects in Trisomy 21.2) Determine the functional genomic connectivity of Conserved Non-Coding Sequences (CNCS) of HSA21.3) Assess the transcriptome dysregulation of T21 by RNAseq.4) Study the epigenetic modifications related to HSA21 and T21.5) Establish and study T21 iPS (induced pluripotent stem cells).6) Study the somatic mutations in the Leukemia of Down syndromeThe results of this research will contribute to the elucidation of the complex mechanisms of the phenotypic consequences of genomic dosage imbalance, which is likely to be related to the variability of the functional components of the genome.

Thymic epithelial cells (TEC) avert autoimmunity through their ability to promiscuously express virtually the entire protein-coding gene repertoire as a molecular library against which immature T cells are selected. An integrative analysis of the transcriptome, epigenome and proteome of distinct TEC subpopulations will be used to attain an unparalleled systems-level understanding of the molecular conditions that select a tolerant T cell repertoire under normal physiological conditions. Establish ing the molecular mirror of tissue specific self-antigen expression by single TEC has implications for understanding autoimmunity, the design of vaccines and the formation of a repertoire of tissue-specific regulatory T cells that can be co-opted by tumours to escape from immunological detection. Our findings will also be relevant for other areas of biology where stochasticity in gene expression of individual cells (e.g. stem cells) influences the establishment and maintenance of cell fate and function, and where gene silencing is overcome either as part of regular developmental programmes or in the context of malignant transformation. To achieve these aims we will develop generally useful new proteomic and microfluidic methods, single cell genomic and epigenetic technologies, novel mathematical models of cellular interaction, and new statistical approaches for understanding biology at single cell resolution.

We propose to utilise this technology to sample the methylome and gene expression profile simultaneously from single cells of individual founder embryos before, during and after generation of HNES cell lines using the recently published scM&T-seq technology. The data generated will be used to explore the variation of gene expression and associated epigenetic modification, particularly of imprinted genes, between cells at each stage and during the process. In additional experiments, we will expand individual clones arising from cells separated from the same embryo to exploit the possibility to obtain a proportion of clones carrying chromosomal defects of potential medical interest that frequently occur intermixed with normal cells during assisted conception. HNES cells will be used as a model of the implanting human embryo to study the biomechanical changes associated with the transition from apolar inner cell mass to polarised epithelial epiblast. We will examine the expression and distribution of key cytoskeletal proteins during the transition from naïve to primed pluripotency and differentiation, primarily using immunocytochemistry and confocal analysis. For example, we will utilise specific small molecules affecting the actin cytoskeleton, such as Cytochalasin or Jasplokinolide. The readout from these experiments will dictate candidates that will be knocked down to confirm their specific activity and utilised to optimise future culture regimes. Use of compliant hydrogels to which specific extracellular matrix proteins can be tethered will enhance naïve pluripotency and reduce variables in the regime currently imposed by the fibroblast feeder cells currently required.

Although thousands exist, only few of these large intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) have been characterized. The few that have, show powerful biological roles as regulators of gene expression by diverse epigenetic and non-epigenetic mechanisms. Significantly, their expression patterns suggest that some lincRNAs are involved in cellular pathways critical in cancer, like the p53 pathway. I explored this association demonstrating that p53 induces the expression of many lincRNAs. One them, named lincRNA-p21, is directly induced by p53 to play a critical role in the p53 response, being required for the global repression of genes that interfere with p53 induction of apoptosis. My results, together with the emerging evidence in the field, suggest that lincRNAs may play key roles in numerous tumor-suppressor and oncogenic pathways, representing an unknown paradigm in cellular transformation. However, their mechanisms of function and biological roles remain largely unexplored. The goal of this project is to decipher the functional and biological roles of lincRNAs in the context of oncogenic pathways to better understand the cellular mechanisms of gene regulation at the epigenetic and non-epigenetic levels, and be able to implement lincRNA use for diagnostics and therapies. In order to accomplish these goals we will integrate molecular and cell biology techniques with functional genomics approaches and in vivo studies. Importantly, the profiling of patient samples will reveal the relevance of our findings in human disease. Together, the functional study of lincRNAs will not only be crucial for developing improved diagnostics and therapies, but also will help a better understanding of the mechanisms that govern cellular network.

For cells to assume their correct fate is essential for development, epistasis and regeneration of any tissue, organ or organism. Elucidating the principles and molecular pathways underlying cell fate decisions is crucial for understanding how cells become corrupted in disease. The recent discovery of a large conserved class of small RNA genes, through the study of the control of developmental timing in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, opened up a new and unexpected dimension of gene regulation. Although we know very little about the biology of these small RNAs, the few examples that have been studied suggest that these genes are likely to have a major impact in many areas of biology. My laboratory will concentrate on basic questions on how microRNAs control gene expression. Specifically, I would like to address the following questions: 1. Where and when are microRNAs expressed? 2. What are the direct targets of microRNAs? 3. How do microRNAs interface with known pathways that regulate cell division, death and differentiation? 4. What are the mechanisms of microRNA action? Our approach will be multi-facetted, combining molecular genetics in C. elegans, microarray expression analysis, bioinformatics and functional studies in mammalian cell lines.

Polycomb protein complexes modify chromatin to repress developmental regulator genes and are emerging as key drivers of the epigenetic changes that occur in cancer. One of the clearest links between disruption to polycomb function and tumourigenesis is found in endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS). ESS can arise from the waves of proliferation and differentiation that stromal cells undergo as they differentiate into decidual cells during each menstrual cycle. Women with ESS are most often treated by hysterectomy but many patients have late recurrence or metastases, which are not responsive to chemotherapy. ESS commonly displays translocation of chromosomes 7 and 17, fusing JAZF1 in place of the N-terminus of the polycomb protein SUZ12/JJAZ1. This JAZF1-SUZ12 fusion protein promotes proliferation and inhibits apoptosis, indicating a role in cell transformation. How this fusion event regulates polycomb function during decidualisation and how it contributes to ESS tumourigenesis is unknown. We have found that JAZF1-SUZ12 fusion removes SUZ12 non-coding RNA binding activity, which functions in targeting polycomb to chromatin. We hypothesise that this alters polycomb targeting, leading to changes in epigenetic modification and to cell transformation. To test this, we will use genome-wide measurements of protein-DNA interaction (ChIP-Seq) to identify the changes in epigenetic modifications caused by JAZF1 fusion in endometrial stromal cells. We will then determine whether these chromatin changes are associated with cell transformation and seek to identify the genes disregulated by JAZF1-SUZ12 that are driving this process.

Despite the progress in metastasis research of the past years, we still lack sufficient insights into how cancer cells leave the primary tumor, disseminate throughout the organism and initiate metastatic outgrowth in a distant organ. Obviously, the migratory and invasive capabilities of cancer cells are critical parameters in the metastatic cascade. 90% of all cancers originate from epithelial tissues, and to leave the primary tumor and to invade into the surrounding tissue tumor cells dissolve their cell-cell contacts and adjust their cell-matrix adhesion sites to a more transient, migratory and invasive mode. Such temporary and reversible phenomenon is known as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a multistage process that involves distinct genetic and epigenetic alterations and leads to metastasizing, tumor-seeding cells with stem cell-like capabilities, potentially cancer stem cells. Disseminating cancer cells also acquire the ability to overcome the loss of substrate adhesion and immune surveillance in the blood stream. Moreover, experimental and clinical data indicate that metastatic cancer cells are highly refractory to chemotherapy. The molecular events underlying the transition from a benign tumor to a malignant cancer and the subsequent formation of metastases are a major focus in our laboratory. During the past ~20 years, we have delineated several molecular processes underlying an EMT and malignant tumor progression. However, the knowledge about the hierarchical organization of the regulatory networks of EMT at a comprehensive level, i.e. the functional interplay between transcription factor activities, miRNA targeting and signaling pathway activities, is still sparse. Recently, we have also reported that EMT promotes cancer cell drug resistance and tumorigenicity, both hallmarks of cancer stem cells, and we are now eager to find out how the regulatory networks of EMT functionally connect to cancer stemness, drug resistance and metastasis formation. We have recently established a long list of protein encoding genes, miRNAs and lncRNAs that change in their expression during the consecutive morphological states of an EMT by RNA sequencing. In addition, we have performed a high-content microscopy screen with siRNAs libraries targeting all annotated transcription factors, kinases, and phosphatases in murine mammary epithelial cells undergoing a TGFß-induced EMT. These and subsequent validation experiments have identified most of the transcription factors and signaling molecules already known to play a role in EMT but also a substantial number of additional transcription factors, kinases and phosphatases and also miRNAs not previously implicated in an EMT. We have already reported on the detailed functions of some of the unexplored transcription factors and signaling pathways during an EMT and metastasis formation (Sox4, Klf4, Lhx2. Dlx2, Tead2, PI3K and PDGFR signaling). Here, we propose to establish a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory networks underlying an EMT. Employing a combination of cell biology, biochemistry, high-content microscopy screening, mouse genetics, histopathological and computational approaches, we will address specific questions that range from an early characterization and correlation of potential pathways connecting EMT, cancer stemness, and drug resistance in vitro to the functional testing of some of these regulatory pathways during the metastatic process in vivo. We will focus on three subprojects that will 1. delineate the functional interconnection between a number of transcription factors, kinases and phosphatases and miRNAs and establish a comprehensive picture of the regulatory circuits of EMT and metastasis, 2. investigate the functional contribution of an EMT process to chemo-resistance of cancer cells and identify the underlying molecular mechanisms, and 3. assess how epigenetic modifications are affecting the reversibility and irreversibility of an EMT and of metastasis formation. Together, the multipronged approaches proposed here will provide many independent insights into the functional connection of EMT, drug resistance and cancer stemness and their contribution to cancer metastasis. The combination of these results will enable us to pinpoint specific signaling pathways and transcriptional regulatory circuits that are critical for the development of drug resistance and/or for metastasis formation.

Among the most common clinical abnormalities patients may experience a characteristic facial appearance , postnatal growth deficiency , visceral and skeletal abnormalities , mental retardation, moderate and immunological dysfunction . Mutations of the genes MLL2 and KDM6A have been identified as the main cause of the onset of Kabuki Syndrome . Both genes code for proteins that are part of the chromatin regulatory complex named MLL4 . The main objective of this project is to investigate the pathological role of the mutated MLL4 complex in the etiology of the Kabuki Syndrome (KS). The lack of cellular and animal models has limited the study of the molecular mechanisms underlying the Kabuki Syndrome. To overcome these limitations, we will develop an experimental model that will allow us to assess the effects of these mutations on cellular events that modulated by MLL2 and KDM6A in mesenchymal stem cells. This experimental approach will allow to better understand the molecular mechanism underlying the Kabuki Syndrome and thus promote the development of new therapeutic strategies for patients with this disease.

Most children exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis show no signs of infection, whilst others become latently infected. I have shown that Highly TB-Exposed Uninfected (HEU) children have higher levels of 6-keto-PGF1-alpha , a metabolite of prostacyclin, than their exposure-matched Highly TB-Exposed Infected (HEI) peers, and that BCG-specific levels at 24 hours following stimulation are also higher. In vitro infection of macrophages with M. abscessus and M. tuberculosis demonstrates that prostacyclin agonists increase host mycobacterial control. Prostacyclin production is mediated by vitamin D, which is associated with latent infection. It acts upon innate and adaptive immune cells, including via microRNA-155, which is implicated in trained innate immunity. I therefore aim to test: Hypothesis 1: mRNA levels of the prostacyclin pathway are differentially expressed in HEU children compared with HEI children. Hypothesis 2: microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs differ in whole blood from HEU children compared with HEI children reflecting epigenetic mechanisms of trained innate immunity Hypothesis 3: HEU children have higher levels of 25(OH) Vitamin D than HEI children. Hypothesis 4: MTB-specific antibodies have enhanced effector functions in HEU children compared with HEI children. To do this I will: 1. sequence RNA to measure levels of mRNA of proteins involved in the prostacyclin pathway and of regulatory miRNAs and long non-coding RNAs 2. quantify 25(OH) Vitamin D levels 3. evaluate MTB-specific antibody effector functions using stored samples from Gambian HEI and HEU children.

702	Mr Stuart Robinson	Newcastle University	None	2015-08-01	2014-09-30	Epigenetic cross talk between tumour and the innate immune system in colorectal liver metastases	Normally the immune system is able to seek out and destroy abnormal cells within the body. One of the mechanisms of cancer survival is their ability to modify the behaviour of immune cells surrounding them so that rather than seeking to destroy the cancer they encourage its growth and protect it from the rest of the immune system. The process through which this happens is poorly understood but is likely to be multifactorial. Exosomes are small membrane bound envelopes actively secreted from cancer cells and taken up by cells surrounding them. They contain a number of molecules, known as micro RNA’s (miRNA), which are able to alter the pattern of gene expression within these cells. At present it is not known what role exosomes play in the behaviour of colorectal liver metastases or how they alter the type of immune cells present in the tumour environment. By comparing the miRNA expression of exosomes in patients with colorectal liver metastases who have early disease recurrence following surgery with those who do not we hope to identify those miRNA’s that are associated with an aggressive tumour behaviour. In addition we intend to characterise the immune cell populations around those tumours and determine how this is affected by the pattern of exosome miRNA expression.

While environmental and genetic factors conveying risk for AUD and related externalizing disorders have been identified it is not established if these factors are dependent on the socio-cultural and psychosocial context, or whether they are influenced by epigenetic and genetic factors specific for certain ethnicities. Furthermore, some environmental risk factors are specific to emerging societies, including exposure to nutritional stress, environmental neurotoxins and culturally dependent forms of psychosocial stress. We will investigate in collaboration with the National Institute for Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bangalore and partners from Bangalore, Mysore, Calcutta, Chandigarh and Pune if environmental and genetic risk factors in industrialised countries and emerging societies shape brain function and behaviour in distinct ways, thus leading to different risk constellations and neurobehavioural trajectories for substance misuse and externalising disorders. Our objectives are: (1)Establishment of an accelerated longitudinal cohort of >10.000 individuals in India aged 6-23 years. (2)Assessment of addictive behaviour and detailed behavioural and clinical characterisation, with emphasis on externalising behaviour. (3)Assessment of environmental exposures to risk and resilience factors impacting gene expression, brain development, temperaments and behaviours. (4)Collection of biological samples in all participants. (5)Assessing neural processes using functional and structural neuroimaging in a subgroup of 1000 individuals. (6)Investigation of gene x environment modulation of brain development, and externalising and addictive behaviour through genetic and epigenetic studies. (7)Establishment of a bioresource with integrated database and biobank. (8)Capacity building through joint UK-Indian research activities.

First discovered in Drosophila, where they are required for silencing of homeotic gene expression, polycomb proteins have since been found to play a key role in mammalian development and the maintenance of stem cell identity. Their disregulation is associated with aberrant gene experssion in a range of malignancies. The general aim of the project is to study the function of Polycomb group proteins at a well defined mammalian locus, the alpha globin gene cluster, in order to establish general principles of Polycomb function in mammals. In embryonic stem cells several hundred genes are bound by Polycomb. During development, removal of Polycomb is essential for activation of lineage-specific genes. The mechanisms governing this removal in mammals remain obscure. The specific goal of the project is to study this process at the alpha globin gene locus. This locus has been the subject of intense investigation by the host laboratory and is consequently amongst the best characterised mammalian gene clusters. The host laboratory has shown that Polycomb proteins bind to regions of the alpha globin cluster silencing expression in embryonic stem and non-erythroid cells but in differentiated erythroid cells binding is absent. The first aim of the project is to establish the timing of Polycomb removal during erythroid differentiation. We will isolate by FACS populations enriched in haematopoietic stem cells and various progenitor populations from primary bone marrow samples. The presence of Polycomb at the alpha globin locus will be determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and real time PCR. Current ChIP protocols require a minimum of 106 cells, however only 103 to 105 cells of each progenitor population can be obtained from a single bone marrow sample. Therefore we will employ a novel ChIP method in which Drosophila cells are added as a ?Carrier?. This technique can reliably analyse as few as 100-1000 cells. The second aim of the project is to determine the sequences required for Polycomb recruitment and for removal during differentiation. We will employ mononucleosomal ChIP and a tiled array to determine Polycomb binding at single nucleosome resolution across the alpha globin locus. We will also characterise Polycomb binding in erythroid cell lines (interspecies hybrids) containing deletions of previously identified cis-regulatory regions and of the alpha globin promotors. We hope to discover general principles governing removal of Polycomb during mammalian development.	Medical Research Council	Fellowship	110609.0	GBP

Poor maternal diet, maternal obesity and gestational diabetes directly influence offspring growth and lead to prevalent health problems including obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Developmental programming of offspring health is well recognised but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Progress through human studies is hampered by the long time-scales involved and the obvious ethical barriers to experimental interventions. A number of useful animal models have been developed involving manipulation of offspring growth, typically through manipulation of maternal diet, but rapid further progress will require a genetic model of developmental programming. We have produced such a model using a knockout of the imprinted Grb10 gene. Grb10 knockout mice are large at birth and as adults are lean with enhanced insulin signalling and improved ability to clear a glucose load. Cross-fostering experiments allowed us to separate effects of Grb10 acting in offspring from those of maternal Grb10. Our findings indicate that Grb10 has evolved coadapted functions in mother and offspring in order to optimize offspring growth and physiology. These properties indicate a role for Grb10 as a developmental programming gene. In support of this, in recent studies of two different maternal dietary restriction models Grb10 was found to be up-regulated in the liver of affected offspring. Here, we propose to directly test the role of Grb10 as a developmental programming gene by combining our genetic model with an established maternal dietary restriction model. This will be the first functional validation of a developmental programming gene. We will also use our combined model to identify further developmental programming genes as well as signature epigenetic changes (DNA methylation and histone modifications) associated with them.

The pathogenesis of these diseases is still unresolved. Recent evidence supports the notion that T helper (Th)1 and Th17 cells are among the major drivers of autoimmune diseases. Nevertheless, T cell targeted therapies are still not effective in a large majority of patients. This is likely due to the fact that these compounds act in a non-specific manner. Therefore it has become increasingly necessary to understand differentiation pathways of T cell lineages under pathogenic in vivo conditions in order to develop more targeted therapies. To date, still little is known about the epigenetic modifications that govern effector T cells differentiation. New high-throughput, comprehensive approaches, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation with massive parallel sequencing, allow quantitative, genome-wide analysis of epigenetic modifications, transcription factor binding and RNA expression. These analyses have provided a detailed picture of T cell “lineages”, but have also led to the surprising finding of “bivalent” epigenetic marks of master regulator transcription factors. This provides the opportunity for unexpected flexible expression and raises the possibility that T cell lineages could be reprogrammed under certain conditions. Present studies have focused their analysis on in vitro generated murine T cell subsets whereas little is known in regard to the regulation of T cell plasticity in vivo. Therefore the aim of the present study is to analyze epigenetic modifications of effector T cells in order to determine their commitment versus flexibility under in vitro and under pathogenic in vivo conditions. In the first part of this study we plan to analyze the epigenetic modifications of in vitro differentiated Th1 and Th17 cells after several differentiation time-points. Thereby we expect to gain a detailed epigenetic profile of differentially generated effector T cells. In the second part of this study we plan to analyze epigenetic modifications of effector T cells that develop under pathogenic conditions, in an autoimmune and an infectious model. In particular the experimental autoimmune encephalitis model and an infectious model with Helicobacter pylori and Toxoplasma gondii will be used. This will enable comparative analyses of epigenetic modifications of T cells that derive in vitro and under pathogenic in vivo conditions. Thereby we expect to identify changes in the epigenetic signature that occur along their differentiation pathway. This detailed road map of T cell differentiation might ultimately serve to develop strategies for targeted therapies to reprogram pathogenic T cells.

At the same time a sophisticated multi-layered regulatory system is required to fine-tune and resolve the immune response to prevent immunopathology or autoimmunity. Based on a quantitative proteomics approach with lung tissue of influenza A virus-infected mice we previously had identified genes with conserved epigenetic domains but yet still undefined function in the immune response. One of the genes, a chromatin modifying enzyme has been genetically mapped to increased susceptibility to asthma. Our preliminary data reveal that these genes are significantly up-regulated upon toll-like receptor stimulation and viral infection. Interferon receptor signaling was found to be indispensable for the transcriptional induction and as such we consider them bona fide interferon-stimulated genes. Our unpublished data from gene-targeted mice suggest that the gene is involved in the regulation of both innate and adaptive antiviral immune responses. In this project proposal we aim to mechanistically dissect the molecular contributions of these chromatin-modifying modulators to the immune system. A complementary approach of molecular cell biology, proteomics, biochemistry and immunology will be employed to delineate how these genes are regulated and which substrates are modified. We also aim to elucidate the individual roles of these genes in the regulation of the immune response using cell culture systems as well as available gene – targeted mice. We hypothesize that these genes form a novel regulatory node that ensures appropriate control of the immune response. A better understanding of the underlying molecular processes in the context of immunoregulation may pave the way for improved therapies for infectious and sterile inflammatory diseases.

Although major advances in the treatment of MPN have been made in recent years, most MPN are incurable chronic disorders with substantial morbidity and mortality. The only curative treatment approach that can be offered at present is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Unfortunately, this procedure can only be performed in a small group of patients (young and fit). In all other patients, management is largely based on symptom-control and the use of growth-inhibitory drugs. However, most drugs used thus far in MPN, including the recently developed tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), have little if any curative potential. In addition, resistance to growth-inhibitory drugs is often seen in advanced MPN. So far, little is known about molecules, signaling networks, and mechanisms underlying disease evolution, progression, and resistance in various MPN. The situation is complicated by the fact that neoplastic stem cells (SC) exhibit intrinsic resistance, have multiple interactions with the SC-protective microenvironment, the so-called ?stem cell niche?, and acquire resistance in multiple subclones during disease evolution. Finally, the genetic background as well as epigenetic mechanisms are considered to play a role in disease evolution and progression in MPN. The general aim of this research program is to address the cellular, biochemical and functional complexity in various MPN by an integrated multidisciplinary approach, to exploit network analyses and resulting concepts to define critical target profiles in neoplastic (stem) cells, and to develop targeted treatment-strategies. The specific long-term aim of the SFB is to develop novel SC-eradicating treatment approaches in Ph+ and Ph- MPN. Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) will serve as a paradigmatic disease model in this SFB. In addition, the SFB will focus on JAK2 V617F-mutated MPN, KIT D816V-mutated systemic mastocytosis (SM) and mast cell leukemia (MCL), and FIP1L1/PDGFRA+ chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL). It can be expected that the SFB will substantially contribute to a better understanding of molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the etiology, progression, and resistance of neoplastic cells in these MPN. Furthermore, data generated in this SFB should provide a solid basis for the development of improved diagnostic and therapeutic concepts in these neoplasms.

Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), is the most prevalent acute leukaemia in adults and remains a disease with a dismal outlook. Uniform hallmarks of AML include abnormal transcriptional programmes and recurrent mutations of epigenetic regulators. Recently, links between aberrant epigenetic regulation and disordered metabolism, another suggested feature of AML, have also been demonstrated. I aim to study mechanisms of altered metabolite generation and their role in establishment/maintenance of AM L by: 1)Performing an unbiased metabolomic screen in fully characterised AML leukaemia cell lines (already underway), with extension to AML mouse models and primary AML samples. 2)Based on the results of this screen, we are generating specific hypothesis on connections between altered signalling/transcription and specific metabolic patterns. 3)Functional validation of these hypothesis in different models including cell lines, AML patient samples and mouse models of AML generated by relevan t mutations. Alterations of cellular phenotype, gene expression, epigenetic marks and intracellular signalling will be assessed following perturbation of specific metabolic pathways. This will form the main part of my proposed fellowship work. 4)Testing the sensitivity of different subtypes of leukaemia to alterations in relevant metabolic pathways, aiming to identify novel therapeutic vulnerabilities in AML that could be exploited pharmacologically.

711	Dr Pascal Lefevre	University of Leeds	None	None	2019-04-01	Role of noncoding RNA in changes in epigenetic states during inflammatory response	With 98 percent of the transcriptional activity along the genome not related to protein coding regions, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play central roles in regulating gene expression. Moreover, transcriptional activity itself is known to impact on chromatin structure, with several chromatin remodelling complexes identified as part of the transcription elongation machinery. However, little is known about the impact of this transcription machinery on the chromatin of intergenic regions, the reason being that once transcripts are detected, chromatin alterations have already happened. Such studies therefore require an inducible model. Using such a system, our recent work uncovered a novel mechanism of chromatin remodelling that involves non-coding RNA transcription. The enhancer blocker protein CTCF binds to the chicken lysozyme - 2.4 kb cis-regulatory element and represses lysozyme gene expression. LPS stimulation induces the transient expression of non-coding RNA transcribing through the CTCF binding site. This event drives the repositioning of a nucleosome located upstream of the silencer over the CTCF binding site and leads to CTCF eviction. The purpose of this proposal is to identify the molecular details of this transcription elongation dependent chromatin reorganisation associated with abrogation of gene silencing activity.

712	Dr Rakyan	Queen Mary, University of London	None	2010-04-19	2012-10-18	A human genome-wide screen for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance	In recent years, several studies have reported inter- individual phenotypic differences that cannot be explained by genetic or environmental heterogeneity, and yet are transmitted to the offspring. We are now beginning to realize that the molecular mechanisms at the heart of these phenomena are epigenetic. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation or histone marks, play key roles in genome function, and thus it is not surprising that the epigenetic landscape is under tight developmental regulation. However, recent evidence suggests that epigenetic profiles in mammals can be perturbed by environmental or stochastic factors. But could such epigenetic variants, or epialleles, be transmitted to subsequent generations? From a teleological perspective, epialleles should not be passed on to the next generation as they might interfere with key developmental programs. However, studies in mouse models show that epialleles occasionally escape the reprogramming events that occur during normal development, and thus persist in the cells of the offspring. If common, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance could have a significant impact on phenotypic outcomes. However, conclusive evidence of this phenomenon in humans is still lacking. To date, only three single-locus studies have claimed transgenerational epigenetic inheritance-like effects in humans, and even these have been controversial. We intend to perform the first-ever systematic genome-wide screen for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in humans. The experimental design builds on substantial pilot data, and uses a systems-level approach that integrates a cohort of monozygotic twins and their offspring, genome-wide DNA methylation profiling, high- throughput sequencing, and bioinformatics. The results will yield crucial insights into the phenomenon of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, thereby significantly impacting on our understanding of the biological basis of heritable phenotypes.

There is a large and growing population of patients with greatly increased incidence of skin cancer, this is a particular problem for transplant recipients and other patients receiving long term immunosuppression or patients with a range of genetic syndromes. These patients can develop multiple skin cancers per year requiring frequent and often mutilating surgeries. Whilst individual skin cancers can be treated surgically, there are few effective methods for reducing the rate of new skin cancer development. The goal of this research is to identify pathways that will lead to the development of new drugs that can achieve this. We will use new whole-genome analysis methods to study the mutations and alterations in gene regulation that occur at the very earliest stages of cancer formation. We hope that these findings will have application not only to skin cancer but also to a wide range of other human malignancies.

We then will derive the extent of causality between altered metabolism and macrophage phenotype and aim at dissecting the molecular signal that actually translates metabolism into phenotype upon compound treatment. We will mainly rely on primary murine macrophages (M0, M1 and M2) as model in vitro test system. Upon respective treatment, markers for macrophage polarization, rates of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, mitochondrial function, redox load as well as the metabolite profiles will be assessed. Causal contexts will be derived by integrated data analysis and/or corroborated by overexpression/knockdown or depletion /supplementation approaches. When deciphering the molecular link between significantly altered metabolites and macrophage polarization, special attention will be given to epigenetic gene regulation. In vitro findings will be corroborated in an appropriate in vivo model. The proposed work is located at the interface between pharmacognosy, immunology, metabolomics and molecular biology. Likewise, it will employ multiple techniques including aseptic cell culture and manipulation (differentiation/polarization) of monocytes/macrophages, expression analyses on the protein (e.g. flow cytometry, western blot, proteomics) and mRNA level (qPCR (arrays)), mass spectrometric analyses of metabolites, live assessment of the cellular energy phenotype by extracellular flux analysis, overexpression and knockdown experiments, in vivo studies as well as bioinformatic data integration. For this, appropriate senior experts, i.e. Elke Heiss (PI; Department of Pharmacognosy, University of Vienna), Wolfram Weckwerth (Department of Molecular Systems Biology+ Vienna Metabolomics Center, University of Vienna), and Thomas Weichhart (Institute of Medical Genetics, Medical University of Vienna), as well as two graduate students (hired upon granted project) collaborate in order to successfully accomplish this interdisciplinary project. Obtained results will foster the understanding if and to what extent cellular metabolism drives pro-or anti-inflammatory activities of natural products in macrophages and how metabolic cues are translated into distinct macrophage phenotypes. Findings can inspire and merge into different research areas including drug discovery and appreciation of bioenergetics as effective target of bioactive natural products for manifestation of cellular phenotypes.

Nuclear receptors (NRs) are promising pharmaceutical targets for NAFLD. NRs bind to distinct DNA binding sites and thereby regulate gene transcription. However, recent findings indicate that NR binding sites and regulated genes are not consistently retained across species and are profoundly affected by the metabolic background such as by NAFLD. These findings present a significant obstacle to efforts to translate basic NR functional studies from animal models into effective pharmacological approaches in diseased patients. Therefore, the central goal of this project is to generate the first genome-wide DNA binding profile of FXR, the most promising pharmacological NR target for NAFLD, in human liver tissue from NAFLD patients with and without pharmacological FXR stimulation. More specifically, we will test the hepatic FXR cistrome and transcriptome in normal and morbidly obese human subjects with NAFLD enrolled in clinical trials with the FXR agonist obeticholic acid (OCA). The outcome of these genomic studies will be matched to the metabolic and histological profile of those patients. In addition, we will investigate FXR interactions with the chromatin landscape in more detail using steatotic primary human hepatocytes treated with the FXR ligand OCA and novel non-steroidal FXR ligands. With this study, we hope to identify more individualized and more targeted treatment options for NAFLD. This proposal consists of three specific aims: 1. Determine NR binding motifs in regions of open chromatin in liver tissue from normal patients and patients with NAFLD. We will isolate and analyze open chromatin using the FAIRE-Seq method. We will perform motif analysis for unknown transcription factor binding sites first, followed by a specific motif analysis using established binding motifs of the metabolic active NRs FXR, LRH-1, LXRs and PPARs. 2. Determine the specific FXR cistrome in liver tissue of normal patients and patients with NAFLD treated with and without the FXR ligand OCA. We will analyze the FXR cistrome by FXR ChIP-Seq and the transcriptional profile by RNA-Seq. The genetic profile of the cistrome and transcriptome will then be matched to the metabolic profile of those patients. 3. Determine the chromatin landscape for FXR binding and transcriptional activity under steatotic conditions. For in-depth analysis of the epigenetic requirements for FXR binding we will use human primary hepatocytes, which will be treated with fatty acids to induce macrosteatosis and different FXR agonists. Experiments will include genome wide analysis of histone modifications which positively and negatively affect NR action and analysis of polymerase II binding as marker for transcriptional activity.

Heritable variation was traditionally thought to occur exclusively as a result of DNA sequence polymorphisms, but it is now clear that a significant portion of heritable variation occurs by other means, among which epigenetic processes appear to play a major role (Madlung and Comai, 2004; Richards, 2006; Richards, 2008; Bossdorf et al., 2008). Understanding the degree of epigenetic diversity and its influence on the relationship between environment, genotype and phenotype should improve our ability to predict the effect of environmental changes on performance and potential of plants and their progeny. To reach this goal this project aims to: • quantify the amount of epigenetic variation that occurs as a result of DNA sequence polymorphisms, and identify which epigenetic marks are involved, • quantify the amount of epigenetic variation that occurs as a result of environmental variation, and detect which environmental changes and which marks are involved, • investigate the interplay of genetic, epigenetic and environmental variation on phenotype. To date, a major stumbling block in the field has been the sheer complexity of, and the interplay between, the many factors that control the phenotype. We propose to overcome this by integrating methodologies from the fields of both population genetics and classical epigenetics. Specifically, we will extend genome-wide association studies by using whole genome approaches such as sequencing after chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) and after bisulfite conversion (BS-seq) to map the epigenome, and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to investigate the transcriptome. In this approach, a set of Arabidopsis accessions, selected to be both genetically and potentially epigenetically most divergent, will be subject to epigenomic profiling for DNA methylation, histone modifications and nucleosome occupancy. The differences in distribution of chromatin marks between the accessions will then be used as “epi-phenotypes” for genome-wide association mapping. They will also be used as “epi-polymorphisms” for epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). These experiments will be repeated on plants that have been grown for multiple generations under a variety of conditions favoring slow or fast growth, in extreme habitats or under different climatic conditions, nutrition or light regimes. This will enable us to understand the relationship between genetic, environmental and chromatin variation, to address which biotic and abiotic factors induce epigenetic variation, and to explore the link between genetic and epigenetic variation, phenotypic plasticity and environmental adaption. The inheritance of chromatin marks over multiple generations and their effect on phenotype will be used to examine the role of epigenetics in transgenerational memory and environmental adaption.

The zinc finger protein MAZR has been identified as an important negative regulator of the activation of the Cd8 gene complex during the early stages of thymocyte development. Recently, we revealed that MAZR is part of the transcription network that controls cell fate decision. We demonstrated that MAZR represses ThPOK expression in MHC class I-signaled thymocytes, possibly via binding to the Thpok silencer, and thereby preventing redirected differentiation of these thymocytes into the helper lineage. However, the detailed mechanism of how MAZR regulates ThPOK expression during T cell development remains to be elucidated. Furthermore, the role of MAZR in peripheral CD8+ T cells is largely unexplored. In this application, I will investigate the role of potential MAZR/Runx1 interaction in ThPOK repression and cell fate decision of DP thymocytes. In addition, I will elucidate the role of MAZR in ThPOK repression in peripheral CD8+ T cells, particularly from an epigenetic point of view, and will perform a comprehensive analysis of function of MAZR-deficient CD8+ T cells. I anticipate that these studies will further clarify how MAZR is integrated in the transcriptional program of cytotoxic T cell differentiation, and that thereby will advance our understanding of T cell development at a molecular level.

Abstract Strain degradation is an often-observed phenomenon in eukaryotic microorganisms and spans from the loss of pathogenicity to the degeneration of production strains used in biotechnology. Nonetheless such phenomenon hampers various basic research approaches as well as biotechnological applications, it is only poorly understood. One possible explanation for such phenomenon could be genetic imprinting. In the proposed study it is intended to investigate epigenetic effects on the expression of two closely related regulons (cellulase and xylanase) in the industrially important ascomycete Trichoderma reesei. The study will focus on strain- and growth condition-dependent differences in expression of both regulons. It will include wild type, production, and degenerated production strains as well as inducing and repressing conditions for both regulons. Enzymes resulting from the expression of both regulons are key players in the second-generation biofuel production. Both during strain improvement attempts as well as in biofuel production processes strain degeneration can be observed. The project will aid in a better understanding of such degeneration processes consequently leading to avoiding strategies.	Austrian Science Fund FWF	Elise Richter Programme	341439.0	EUR
719	Professor Cosimo De Bari	University of Aberdeen	Institute of Medical Sciences	2018-06-01	2021-05-31	Unlocking the Joint Morphogenetic Code in Mesenchymal Stem Cells from Human Synovium	This discovery project aims to identify the epigenetic code and associated gene expression profile underpinning the joint-morphogenetic ability of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs), with the ultimate goal to preserve, or reinstate, this ability in adult MSCs to safeguard joints from damage, arthritis or ageing. Our work has identified the synovium as an important MSC niche, and has shown in mice that a sub-population of synovial MSCs deriving from the Gdf5-expressing embryonic joint interzone has properties that make them ideally suited for joint maintenance and repair throughout life. In parallel, we have made the exciting discovery that adult human synovial MSCs, culture-expanded and adenovirally modified to overexpress Bmp7, can give rise to a new joint-like organ upon nude mouse intramuscular injection. Since the epigenetic status of cells determines their gene-expression landscape and functional abilities, we hypothesise that the joint-morphogenetic ability of synovial MSCs is laid down during embryonic joint development as an epigenetic code that is preserved in adult life. MSCs descending from the joint interzone, present in synovium, would carry this code, while MSCs with distinct ontogeny, in periosteum and bone marrow, would not. We speculate that an efficient tissue regenerative capacity, necessary for joint homeostasis, is dependent on this code, with loss of the code through ageing or disease resulting in inefficient stem cell-mediated tissue regeneration/repair. To discover this epigenetic code, we will 1) identify the human MSC populations that display joint-morphogenetic ability; 2) perform epigenetic and gene-expression analyses; 3) methodologically validate differentially expressed genes and methylated loci. We will employ our unique in vivo model of ectopic joint formation to investigate whether the joint-morphogenetic ability is specific to human MSCs from synovium by comparing them with MSCs from bone marrow and periosteum. In mouse, we will use our Gdf5-Cre;Tom;Pdgfr&#945;-H2BGFP transgenic model to purify the Gdf5-lineage MSCs (marked by tdTomato), which maintain and repair joints in adulthood, and the remaining synovial MSC lineage(s) marked by Pdgfr&#945;-promoter-driven expression of H2B-GFP. We will carry out genome-wide DNA methylation and RNA-sequencing analyses, comparing for human the MSC populations with/without joint-morphogenetic ability, and for mouse the Gdf5-lineage MSCs with the remaining Pdgfr&#945;+ MSCs. Cells isolated from developing joints of human and mouse embryos will be included for reference as holders of the code. Unique and common DNA-methylation signatures will be identified and mapped against gene expression profiles. The analyses will be conducted separately in human and mouse cells, and differentially expressed genes and methylated loci that are common to human and mouse will be taken forward. Gene-ontology analysis will determine the nature of differentially methylated loci and related transcript networks. Identified differentially methylated loci will be methodologically validated using pyrosequencing, while differentially expressed genes will be validated by quantitative RT-PCR and immunostaining on tissue sections. This work will lead to the identification of epigenetic and gene-expression signatures associated with the joint-morphogenetic ability of MSC populations that can be exploited for therapeutic approaches aimed at preserving or reinstating the joint morphogenetic code in MSCs to maintain healthy joints and prevent or cure early osteoarthritis.

720	Dr Bending	University of Cambridge	None	2011-10-10	2014-10-09	Does the failure of mechanisms to maintain FOXP3 expression in T regulatory cells contribute to the development of severe disease in childhood arthritis?	Childhood arthritis has a wide spectrum of outcomes, ranging from complete remission, through to severe destructive joint inflammation. One factor which has been shown to correlate with clinical severity is the number of FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) at the inflamed site and their relationship to Th17 cells. I hypothesise that bioavailability of key factors in the joint can contribute to the stability of Treg. Such factors include the cytokine TGF?, and the vitamin A derivative all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), which may be lacking in children destined to develop severe disease. If so, these two pathways could offer novel avenues for drug intervention, through signaling pathway modulation, and/or vitamin supplementation. The key goals of this fellowship are four-fold: 1. To define availability of bioactive TGF? and all-trans retinoic acid in the joint in JIA and relate these data to clinical severity, 2. To determine the epigenetic profile of synovial Treg and how TGF? and retinoic acid affect these marks, 3. To investigate whether Treg stability can be manipulated in vitro in order to model the possible effects of therapeutic intervention eg with Vitamin A, 4 To establish my own career as an independent scientist and translational immunologist.

The challenge of propagating genetic and epigenetic information is met in S phase and entails genome-wide disruption and restoration of chromatin coupled to faithful copying of DNA. How specific chromatin structures are restored on new DNA and transmitted through mitotic cell division remains a fundamental question in biology central to understand cell fate and identity.Chromatin restoration on new DNA involves a complex set of events including nucleosome assembly and remodelling, restoration of marks on DNA and histones, deposition of histone variants and establishment of higher order chromosomal structures including sister-chromatid cohesion. To dissect these fundamental processes and their coordination in time and space with DNA replication, we have developed a novel technology termed nascent chromatin capture (NCC) that provides unique possibility for biochemical and proteomic analysis of chromatin replication in human cells. I propose to apply this innovative cutting-edge technique for a comprehensive characterization of chromatin restoration during DNA replication and to reveal how replication timing and genotoxic stress impact on final chromatin state. This highly topical project brings together the fields of chromatin biology, DNA replication, epigenetics and genome stability and we expect to make groundbreaking discoveries that will improve our understanding of human development, somatic cell reprogramming and complex diseases like cancer. The proposed research will 1) identify and characterize novel mechanisms in chromatin restoration and 2) address molecularly how replication timing and genotoxic insults influence chromatin maturation and final chromatin state.

722	Dr Matthew Fuchter	Imperial College London	None	2008-10-01	2011-09-30	Design and Synthesis of Novel Epigenetic Therapeutic Agents	Every cell in our body contains thousands of genes that carry the information essential for life, packaged up into what is known as the genome. Our genomes are therefore often compared to an instruction manual or recipe book. While the recipe book (or gene) contains the information needed to make the dishes (the proteins in our cells), how, where, and when this information is used is controlled by the chef (the processing machinery in the cell). Mistakes can happen if there is a typo in the recipe (a mistake in the gene) or if the information is not followed correctly by the chef (the processing machinery) leading to an incorrect final dish (a faulty protein). Faults like these are common in many cancers and some anti-cancer drugs work by blocking the processing machinery in cancer cells which prevents them from growing and dividing. Dr Fuchter is investigating a naturally occurring chemical found in a sea sponge, which is reported to strongly block several components of the processing machinery. The first part of this project is to dissect the naturally-occurring compound to determine what chemical features are necessary for it to work. The second goal is to use this knowledge to develop new anti-cancer drugs.	Worldwide Cancer Research	Project Grant	101258.77	GBP

Using a specific EZH2 inhibitor, which reverses H3K27me3 repressive marks, and an EHMT1/2 inhibitor, which reverses H3K9me3 repressive marks, as well as targeted SiRNA approaches, we have shown that induction of gene expression and inhibition of cancer cell growth are markedly increased when both EZH2 and EHMT1/2 are inhibited, rather than either independently. Thus, our hypothesis is that both H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 repressive marks need to be simultaneously reduced at epigenetically silenced loci in order to induce gene re-expression of specific gene sets. This can most readily be achieved pharmacologically using a dual EZH2 and EHMT1/2 inhibitor, rather than through the challenging of delivery of independent selective inhibitors, and we therefore sought to identify such a compound. Based on the EHMT2 inhibitor BIX-01294, we have identified compounds that re-express select silenced genes, while chromatin immunoprecipitation verified a decrease in silencing marks (H3K27me3, H3K9me3) and an increase in active marks (H3K4me2/3, H3K27ac) at the promoter of re-expressed genes. Biochemically, we show that these inhibitors directly inhibit both EZH2 and EHMT1/2 as substrate competitive inhibitors and are therefore mechanistically distinct from the current candidate EZH2 inhibitors. Treatment of breast tumour cells with these dual inhibitors activates expression of EZH2-silenced and apoptosis-related genes, induces apoptosis and reduces xenograft growth at tolerated doses. In addition, these dual inhibitors reduce viability of mammospheres and ovarian spheroids, consistent with targeting a tumour stem or sustaining cell. The hit compounds we have identified represent starting points for the further optimisation of dual EZH2/EHMT2 inhibitors. While this scaffold has been extensively pursued in academic studies for selective EHMT1/2 inhibition, further studies are needed to confirm whether it is possible to simultaneously increase potency against both EZH2 and EHMT1/2. Our expression analysis has identified key loci (SPINK1) whose expression is only induced by dual inhibition and can serve as a sensitive cell-based assay for further optimizing dual inhibitory activity. One of the current hit compounds identified has reasonable ADME properties, inhibits cell growth at low micromolar concentrations and is well tolerated by mice. This will be a useful starting point for further optimization. Thus we are proposing further validation and development of our current hits into leads for in vivo evaluation.

Specifically, we uncovered a narrow window of epigenetic sensitivity in gliomagenesis, during which tumor development is dependent on the role of Ezh2, the main enzyme responsible for H3K27 trimethylation within Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). Following the establishment of bona-fide glioma initiating cells (GICs), we found in fact that the Polycomb axis becomes dispensable for tumor self-renewal, an unexpected result that invites a revision of the current model of Polycomb action in tumorigenesis and affords the opportunity to characterize the establishment and maintenance of cancer stem cell compartments in terms of functionally relevant epigenetic changes. Our objective is thus to dissect the epigenetic basis of glioma recurrence, using the regulatory networks we are uncovering in our epigenetically modulated murine models to interrogate a uniquely rare cohort of human GBM samples, in which we can analyse for the first time in the same patient the progression of epigenetic changes during GBM recurrence. As surgery at GBM relapse is exceedingly rare, this cohort of well-established samples represent a unique opportunity to relate disease progression to epigenetic changes. Setting itself apart from the wealth of largely descriptive studies however, our approach interrogates the transcriptomic and epigenomic deregulation of human glioma recurrence through an innovative combination of experimental and computational approaches that is based on the reverse engineering of gene networks emerging from our functional validation of disease stages upon epigenetic modulation.

Somatic cell reprogramming is overcoming this limitation through the derivation of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) that can be differentiated into disease-relevant cell-types. Despite these tantalizing possibilities, there are critical issues to be addressed in order to secure iPSC-modeling as a robust platform for the interrogation of disease aetiology and the development of new therapies. These concern the taming of human genetic variation, the identification of differentiation stages in which to uncover and validate phenotypes, and finally their translational into drug discovery assays. This project confronts these challenges focusing on the paradigmatic case of two rare but uniquely informative disorders caused by symmetric gene dosage imbalances at 7q11.23: Williams Beuren Syndrome and the subset of autism spectrum disorders associated to 7q11.23 microduplication. The hallmark of WBS is a unique behavioral-cognitive profile characterized by hypersociability and intellectual disability in the face of comparatively well-preserved language abilities. Hence, the striking symmetry in genotype and phenotype between WBS and 7dupASD points to the 7q11.23 cluster as a surprisingly small subset of dosage-sensitive genes affecting social behaviour and cognition. We build on a large panel of iPSC lines that we already reprogrammed from a unique cohort of WBS and 7dupASD patients and whose characterization points to specific derangements at the level of transcriptional/epigenetic control, protein synthesis and synaptic dysfunction. Through the integration of transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling with targeted mass spectrometry and gene network prediction we propose an innovative drug discovery pipeline for the identification of new therapeutic leads.

Yet, resolving these questions will be essential to fill the current gaps in understanding the molecular basis of epigenetic programming of cell identity.In this regard, the recent discovery of active DNA demethylation revolutionized our thinking about the epigenetic role of cytosine methylation (5mC). We and others were able to show that gene regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers undergo cyclic methylation and de-methylation through an enzymatic process involving oxidation, excision and repair of methylated DNA bases (5mC). This clashes with the classical view of 5mC as a stable epigenetic mark, a concept that hence fails to provide a rationale for a function of dynamic methylation changes.The overarching goal of this project is therefore to clarify the epigenetic function of such, apparently futile, active DNA demethylation. On the basis of a substantial body of preliminary evidence, we postulate that cyclic methylation-demethylation is targeted to genomic sites to trigger epigenetic plasticity at the nucleosomal level, via induction of DNA repair processes. The research proposed here thus focuses on the following objectives: 1: Establishing a functional and mechanistic link between active DNA demethylation and dynamic nucleosome states2: Determining the implicated role of RNA and DNA/RNA hybrid molecules in cyclic active DNA demethylation and the maintenance of epigenetic plasticityThis research program introduces a novel conceptual approach to address the epigenetic function of active DNA demethylation. A successful completion of the proposed research will provide a mechanistic link between DNA methylation and nucleosomal behavior, a fundamental question of epigenetics.

Therefore, it is important to further explore germline DNA methylation alterations as a mechanism for cancer predisposition. Previous work showed that germline DNA methylation differences can be detected between breast cancer patients and healthy controls in peripheral blood DNA. This proposal aims to validate previously identified methylation differences and discover novel differences that may be useful for predicting breast cancer risk. Secondly, this project will investigate the mechanism of gene regulation by the germline methylation differences and how this may confer cancer risk. This work will improve our ability to identify those at high risk" of breast cancer and may help in understanding the molecular eitiology of carcinogenesis.

However, there is a growing need to perform molecular epidemiology studies on tissue specific cell types that are relevant to the disease, particularly for epigenetic biomarkers and gene expression where tissue specific differences may be expected. For breast cancer, it is not feasible to collect breast epithelial cells (BECs) from large cohorts. However, we propose to initiate a prospective cohort collecting exfoliated BECs collected from expressed breast milk (EBM) stored in a hospital milk bank. The Milk Bank at Queen Charlotte’s and Chelsea Hospital routinely collects EBM samples, some of which are made available for research purposes. While lactating BECs are highly differentiated, they are specific in a very important and relevant function, which is that they are at their most ER responsive state. We hypothesise that these are very relevant for studying normal ER function and breast cancer risk factors for ER-positive disease. This pilot study aims firstly to continue to improve the recruitment, quality control and standard operating procedures for collecting fresh and frozen milk samples for a research cohort. Secondly, we aim to perform preliminary experiments to generate a comprehensive characterisation of these cells to address their suitability for the experimental aims of such a cohort. Specifically, we will investigate gene expression, DNA methylation and the chromatin states of these cells in comparison to publically available data, explore candidate epigenetic risk biomarkers and, finally, assess the degree of inter-individual variability in the potentially anti-tumorigenic HAMLET complex, which could be a novel breast cancer risk biomarker.

Germline mutations in BRCA1 strongly predispose individuals to breast and ovarian cancer. Somatic mutations in BRCA1 are very rare but a significant proportion of sporadic triple negative breast cancers are phenotypically and molecularly similar to BRCA1 -mutant cancers. The loss of BRCA1 expression in these sporadic cases is proposed to be central to their biology, but the mechanism responsible for this loss is unknown. Patients with sporadic BRCA1 -deficient tumours may benefit from PARP inhibitor therapy which exploits the deficiency in homologous-repair mechanisms caused by the loss of BRCA1 , but their clinical identification is currently difficult. In a small percentage of sporadic breast tumours, BRCA1 is subject to epigenetic repression in association with promoter DNA hypermethylation. Repression by polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) frequently precedes DNA hypermethylation in both normal and cancerous cells and EZH2 , a component of the PRC2 complex, is highly expressed in sporadic BRCA1-deficient cancers. We will determine whether PRCs cause BRCA1 repression in pre-clinical cell line models of sporadic BRCA1 -deficient breast cancer to determine the potential utility of epigenetic biomarkers for the identification of sporadic BRCA1 -deficient cases in the clinic. In particular, PRC repression in normal cells is accompanied by chromatin compaction that is detectable by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH). We will evaluate whether BRCA1 repression by PRCs in breast cancer is also accompanied by chromatin compaction and, therefore, whether FISH can be used to identify sporadic BRCA1 -deficient breast cancer cases in the clinic.

730	Dr Luca Magnani	Imperial College London	None	2013-10-01	2014-09-30	Identification of novel drivers of endocrine therapy resistance	Over 70% of all breast cancers are guided by the nuclear receptor ERα. ERα drive proliferation by binding regulatory elements and regulate transcription of hundreds of genes. Approximately 50% of ERα positive patients respond to first line anti-ERα endocrine therapies. However, 50% of tumors are or become resistant to such treatments resulting in poor outcome for these patients. While several hypotheses have been put forward, resistance to endocrine therapy is still not understood. More specifically, resistance to aromatase inhibitors (AI) and fulvestrant (F) has not been yet tackled. Aromatase inhibitors and fulvestrant prevent ERα binding to regulatory elements, while tamoxifen blocks co-activation but does not impede binding suggesting that AI and F resistant tumors use alternative transcription factors to promote growth. Indeed, our data indicate that the chromatin of AI resistant cell lines is not permissive to ERα binding even in case of strong ERα expression. This pilot grant want to test the hypothesis that epigenetic reprogramming occurs during the development of AI and F resistance. More precisely, we propose that chromatin accessibility is rewired to allow binding of a diverse array of transcription factors not yet characterized as important for breast cancer progression. Almost all transcription factors require accessible chromatin identified using DNaseI hypersensitivity. We will profile several AI and F resistant cell lines and their parental AI and F sensitive clones using DNaseI hypersensitivity coupled with next generation sequencing. This technique has been recently used by ENCODE and is the state of the art approach to define putative regulatory elements and identify all transcription factors potentially interacting with them. We will then determine the expression status of top candidates in resistant and sensitive cells, silence them and test proliferation. We expect to uncover several novel transcription factors involved in the proliferation of AI and F resistant tumors.	Breast Cancer Now	Pilot	None	None

Background: The dramatic phenotypic changes that define most solid cancers are the consequences of profound transcriptional aberrations. Transcriptional anomalies are often ascribed to somatic changes (mutations) occurring in 2% of the human genome, i.e. protein-coding genes (oncogenes2 and/or onco-suppressor genes). However, an important paradigm shift has occurred in the last few years revealing the importance of non-coding regulatory DNA in coordinating transcription and cell identity. Conservative estimates indicate that regulatory regions account for nearly 50% of the genome where they are organized within defined 3D structures (topological associated domains: TADs). Regulatory regions are associated with precise epigenetic states involving histone modifications, chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) data demonstrate that the majority of mutations occur in non-coding regions, however a critical question remains unsolved: what is the contribution of somatic regulatory mutations (SRMs) in altering the information stored at critical regulatory regions? Aims: This proposal is divided in three main aims (systematic characterization, evolutionary profile and functional manipulation of SRMs). Our first aim is to identify and prioritize SRMs targeting the regulatory landscape of ERa BCa patients. Our second aim is study how SRMs emerge and expand during cancer progression. Our last aim is to investigate the functional consequences of SRMs and how they can be exploited in the clinic. By aim3 we will have focused on 5-10 recurring functional SRMs. Methods: Using my epigenetic expertise, I have generated important preliminary data and developed a sensitive and cost-effective targeted strategy to identify potential SRMs drivers. My approach allows for longitudinal analysis of clinically treated patients to study tumor progression and the evolution of drug-resistance. The main hypothesis is that SRMs target regulatory regions and alter gene expression by: 1) altering TFs binding and epigenetic states of oncogenic regulatory regions 2) disrupting the binding sites of TFs involved in chromatin organization and insulation (CTCF). I will use ERa positive breast cancer (BCa) as a model considering that: 1- 97.4% of somatic mutations target non-coding DNA 2- ERa positive BCa is driven by a restricted number of enhancer specific TFs 3- ~3% of patients relapse each year with endocrine therapy resistant disease suggesting progressive tumor evolution. 4- I have access to the most appropriate longitudinal, patient-derived samples with extensive clinical annotations. Impact:- I will identify new potential drivers to improve personalized medicine in a cancer population with unmet need (metastatic BCa) using the most appropriate clinically annotated material.

732	Dr Olivier Binda	Newcastle University	None	2013-08-12	2014-08-11	The role of the lysine methyltransferase SETD6 in breast carcinomas development and metastasis	Epigenetic mechanisms are major contributors to chemo-resistance of breast cancer (BC) patients. I have recently described the post-translational modification of the histone variant H2AZ[1], a key player in BC cellular proliferation[2] and regulation of ER-dependent transcription[3], by the epigenetic factor SETD6, a lysine methyltransferase (KMT). Preliminary experiments indicate that estrogen-responsive genes are downregulated in SETD6-depleted mammary cells. Since SETD6 is required for the self-renewal of embryonic stem (ES) cells[1] and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which facilitates BC metastasis, generates poorly differentiated cells with stem-like features, I thus propose to further investigate SETD6-associated proteins and develop cellular models to study the role of SETD6 in BC metastasis. Aims The main objective is to initiate studies of the role of SETD6 in BC, develop the cellular systems required for those studies, and assemble a comprehensive grant proposal with the following aims: Characterize the SETD6-MTA2 complex Define the role of SETD6 in BC metastasis Investigate the potential role of SETD6 and H2AZ in the EMT Identify KMTs involved in the EMT Techniques and Methodology SETD6 will be purified from stably expressing FLAG-SETD6 BC cell lines. The immunoprecipitates will be analyzed by immunoblotting using commercially available antibodies. The role of SETD6 in BC metastasis will be assessed by standard migration assays in vitro in control cells and SETD6-silenced cells. EMT will be induced in mammary epithelial cells as described[4, 5]. The transition efficiency will be assessed by measuring the expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers. These cells will be used to investigate the role of SETD6 and identify other KMTs during EMT. Impact on breast cancer research Potentially, I will establish a role for SETD6 in BC development and metastasis. This knowledge could eventually be translated in the development of novel epigenetic-based therapies or diagnostics.	Breast Cancer Now	Pilot	19023.0	GBP

The treatment of this disease is critically reliant on the inhibition of androgen receptor (AR) signalling. Current approaches for achieving this are inadequate with most patients becoming resistant to initial systemic depletion of gonadal androgens. Targeting the mechanisms of persistent AR signalling is of intense interest currently. One potential means to achieve this is to target epigenetic modification of AR signalling. Lysine (K)-specific demethylase 1A (LSD1), is an epigenetic AR co-activator which modifies chromatin structure at AR responsive target genes. It’s over expression is a poor prognostic factor in prostate cancer. LSD1 inhibition is achievable with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors which exploits MAO/LSD1 sequence homology. We have synthesised novel analogues of the MAO inhibitor tranylcypromine designed as LSD1 inhibitors. Pilot data show that these analogues inhibit prostate cancer cell growth and AR signalling. We also found synergy with established AR antagonists. The similarity of these novel structures to established drugs would hopefully allow rapid translation of this approach. This project will develop our understanding of the biological consequences of LSD1 inhibition on AR signalling and how this might be incorporated into conventional therapeutic strategies for prostate cancer.

The most common leukaemic disruptions of the MLL1 gene are chromosome translocations that fuse the N terminus of MLL1 in frame with over 40 different partner genes creating novel fusion proteins. Recent work has suggested that wild type MLL1 and MLL1 fusion proteins cooperate in leukaemogenesis by together causing aberrant epigenetic profiles at target genes in vivo. Epigenetic changes are often defined as heritable changes in gene expression or chromosome stability that don’t alter the underlying DNA sequence. We are interested in identifying the key molecular events in MLL1 mediated leukaemogenesis in order to fully understand the epigenetic basis for this disease. This major goal has been divided into three key questions: 1) What key downstream gene targets are essential for MLL1 mediated leukaemogenesis?; 2) how do MLL1 and MLL1 fusion proteins control epigenetic gene regulation on a molecular level?; and 3) how are MLL1 and MLL1 fusion proteins recruited to important gene targets in the cell? To answer these questions, we are using xenograft transplant assays to identify Leukaemic Stem Cells (LSCs) in MLL1 patient samples, ChIP-seq to identify and characterise direct gene targets in specific haematopoietic cell populations, small molecular inhibitors and siRNA combined with ChIP and ChIP-seq to determine how MLL1 fusion proteins regulate gene targets in the cell and MLL1 domain analysis coupled with genome wide techniques to determine how MLL1 is recruited to gene targets in the cell. Answering these questions may not only be useful for future therapeutic strategies, but will also inform our basic understanding of epigenetic gene regulation during normal stem and progenitor cell development.

735	Dr Timothy Hardy	Newcastle University	Institute of Cellular Medicine	2013-09-02	2016-09-01	The role of DNA Methylation as an epigenetic modifier of hepatic fibrosis progression in Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a spectrum encompassing steatosis, steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. It is the commonest cause of liver dysfunction worldwide; the fastest rising in the UK. Whilst the majority of patients with the metabolic syndrome develop steatosis, only a minority go on to develop cirrhosis. Therefore, advances in understanding the pathogenesis and risk factors of progressive disease are urgently needed. I recently reported data suggesting an association between epigenetic remodelling of Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor Gamma (PPARg) by DNA Methylation and disease progression in human NAFLD. I now aim to determine the mechanism by which epigenetic remodelling may influence disease progression. Methods Pyrosequencing for quantitative DNA Methylation analysis:- Tissue from animals with dietary induced NAFLD, >100 serial liver biopsies of patients with steatosis or progressive NAFLD, and laser dissection microscopy to assess whether DNA Methylation of PPARg is pre-set before disease, whether it changes as a consequence of disease progression and in which other genes and liver cells it occurs. I will assess whether these changes are seen in blood. Scientific/Medical opportunities This project is clinically relevant because it will further our understanding of the molecular events that lead to disease progression in NAFLD. Greater understanding of the nature of epigenetic gene changes may in the future outwith this project help to identify novel markers of NAFLD disease progression risk that could be used as part of stratified medicine to individualise patient assessment for importance of lifestyle modification, need for follow up and future anti-fibrotic drug development and trial enrichment.

736	Dr Jaya Krishnan	MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences	None	2012-10-01	2015-11-30	Epigenetic Regulation of Metabolism	The oxygen regulated transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha (Hif1alpha) plays a key role in development and maintenance of pathologic cardiac hypertrophy through regulation of growth and energetic pathways. Genomic enhancers are implicated in tissue- and context-dependent gene expression. To date, it remains unclear how Hif1alpha imposes context- and tissue-specific patterns of gene expression. Our recent data suggests that, in addition to its established role in the direct regulation of coding gene expression, Hif1alpha regulates enhancer-templated non-coding RNA (eRNA) expression in response to pathologic stress. eRNAs are transcribed from intergenic enhancer regions and directly contribute to the control of flanking gene expression, thereby imposing a novel regulatory layer of coding gene control. Using a combination of bioinformatics and experimental validation, we have identified Hif1alpha-dependent eRNAs that exhibit augmented expression in human and mouse cardiomyopathies. Inhibition of these eRNAs during pathologic stress induction alters flanking coding gene expression, leading to resolution of maladaptive metabolic, growth and contractile responses associated with pathologic cardiomyopathy. Based on these findings, our research program aims to extend these findings through systematic identification of novel Hif1alpha-regulated eRNAs in murine surgical and genetic models of cardiomyopathy by genome-wide epigenetic and transcriptomic analysis. Following which, a lentiviral short hairpin RNA (shRNA) library targeting newly identified eRNAs will be established and assessed for their capacity to inhibit in vitro pathologic-stress induced metabolic reprogramming, cardiac hypertrophy and contractile dysfunction. The functional relevance of newly identified eRNAs in mouse models of human heart disease will be studied through application of a novel adeno-associated virus 9-based long-term, inducible and cardiac-specific method of adult mouse transgenesis. The mechanistic basis of eRNA-mediated coding gene regulation will be assessed, and complemented with correlative and associative studies of human cardiomyopathies, with the ultimate goal being the understanding of the role of the non-coding eRNA network in human heart biology and disease. These studies will advance the current understanding of the impact of oxygen-sensitive signalling pathways on eRNA expression and their role in mediating key aspects of cardiac physiology, metabolism and function, thereby laying the foundation for the development of clinically-relevant antisense RNA-based strategies.

The scientific goal of this proposal is to contribute to our understanding of RNA-mediated epigenetic mechanisms of genome regulation in eukaryotes. Choosing ciliated protozoa as model organisms gives a wonderful opportunity to study the incredibly complex epigenetic mechanism of programming large-scale developmental rearrangements of the genome. This involves extensive rearrangements of the germline DNA, including elimination of up to 95% of the genome. The massive DNA rearrangement makes ciliates the perfect model organism to study this aspect of germline-soma differentiation. This process is proposed to be regulated by an RNA-mediated homology-dependent comparison of the germline and somatic genomes. Ciliate's genomic subtraction is one of the most fascinating examples of the use of RNA-mediated epigenetic regulation, and of a specialized RNA interference pathway, to convey non-Mendelian inheritance in eukaryotes. The ?genome scanning' model raises many interesting questions, which are also relevant to other RNA-mediated regulation systems. One of the most intriguing is a ?thermodynamic' problem: the model assumes that a very complex population of small RNAs representing the entire germline genome can be compared to longer transcripts representing the entire rearranged maternal genome, resulting in the efficient selection of germline-specific scnRNAs, which are able to target DNA deletions in the developing nucleus. How is it possible that the truly enormous number of pairing interactions implied can occur in such a short time, just a few hours? RNA-RNA pairing interactions would probably have to be assisted by a dedicated molecular machinery.

Ciliated protozoa offer a fantastic opportunity to investigate the complex process of trans-generational programming of chromosomal rearrangements, which is thought to serve as a form of immune defense against invasive DNA. Developmental processes in ciliates include extensive rearrangements of the germline DNA, including elimination of transposons and the precise excision of numerous single-copy elements derived from transposons. This process is considered to be maternally controlled because the maternal genome provides essential information in the form of RNA that determines the offspring's genome content and organization. This programmed DNA subtraction, the so-called ‘RNA scanning’ process, is mediated by trans-generational comparison between the germline and the maternal somatic genome. One of the most intriguing questions is how a complex population of small RNAs representing the entire germline genome can be compared to the entire rearranged maternal genome, resulting in the efficient selection of germline-specific RNAs, which are able to target DNA deletions in the developing genome. All this occurs in a very short time and involves a massively coordinated transport of all the components between three types of nuclei. This project focuses on characterizing the molecular machinery that can orchestrate the massive genome rearrangements in ciliates through nucleic acids and protein interactions. It also addresses the question how RNA targets DNA cleavage at the right place. In addition, this project aims to investigate the role of RNA in guiding chromosomal rearrangements in other eukaryotic systems, particularly in human cancer cells where genome editing often occurs on a large scale. This work may be the first step in providing novel insights into the process of programmed DNA rearrangements in higher eukaryotes.	European Research Council	Consolidator Grant	1953000.0	EUR
739	Mariusz Nowacki	University of Berne	Institut für Zellbiologie Departement Biologie Universität Bern	2016-07-01	2019-06-30	Understanding Epigenetic Mechanisms of Developmental Genome Rearrangements.	The scientific goal of this proposal is to contribute to our understanding of RNA-mediated epigenetic mechanisms of genome regulation in eukaryotes. Probably one of the most wonderful epigenetic phenomena known to researchers are those accompanying the whole-genome-scale developmental DNA rearrangements in ciliated protozoans. This involves a comparison of the developing zygotic genome with the maternal somatic genome, via RNA molecules, in an extraordinarily massive and precise manner. One of the most intriguing questions is how a complex population of small RNAs representing the entire germline genome can be compared to the entire rearranged maternal genome, resulting in the efficient selection of germline-specific RNAs, which are able to target DNA deletions in the developing genome. All this occurs in a very short time and involves a massively coordinated transport of all the components between three types of nuclei.Paramecium presents an original model to study RNAi-related proteins involved in targeted DNA deletion. Many of these proteins have been generated through gene duplication and functional diversification from RNAi progenitors that produce and use small interfering RNAs. The ability to analyze tens of thousands of deleted DNA regions and sRNAs that match them as well as the protein machinery involved allows us to gain better understanding of the mechanism behind the genome reorganization which so far remains largely enigmatic. The first part of the project aims at in-depth characterization of Dicer and Piwi proteins. It tries to address the question how RNA targets DNA cleavage at the right place, and whether changes in chromatin are playing important role in targeting DNA excision. The second part of the project aims to investigate possible role of RNA in guiding chromosomal rearrangements in non-ciliate systems, particularly in human cancer cells where genome editing often occurs on a large scale. This work may be the first step in providing novel insights into process of programmed DNA rearrangements in higher eukaryotes.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div.

My scientific goal is to contribute to our understanding of RNA-mediated epigenetic mechanisms of genome regulation in eukaryotes. Choosing the ciliated protozoan Paramecium as a model organism gives a wonderful opportunity to study the incredibly complex epigenetic mechanism of programming large-scale developmental rearrangements of the genome. In ciliates, germline and somatic functions are ensured by two different kinds of nuclei, the diploid micronucleus and a DNA rich macronucleus. Sexual events are initiated by meiosis of the micronucleus, and following fertilization, the parental macronucleus is lost and replaced by a new one that develops, like the new micronucleus, from the zygotic nucleus. Macronuclear development involves extensive rearrangements of the germline genome, including elimination of transposons and other repeated sequences and the precise excision of numerous single-copy Internal Eliminated Sequences (IESs). The massive DNA rearrangement makes ciliates the perfect model organism to study this aspect of germline-soma differentiation. This process is proposed to be regulated by an RNA-mediated homology-dependent comparison of the germline and somatic genomes contained in different nuclei. This massive genomic subtraction is one of the most fascinating examples of the use of RNA-mediated epigenetic regulation, and of a specialized RNA interference pathway, to convey non-Mendelian inheritance in eukaryotes. The ‘genome scanning’ model raises many interesting questions, which are also relevant to other RNA-mediated regulation systems. One of the most intriguing is a ‘thermodynamic’ problem: the model assumes that a very complex population of small RNAs representing the entire germline genome (possibly of the order of 10 million different scnRNAs) can be compared to longer transcripts representing the entire rearranged genome of the maternal macronucleus (72 Mb), resulting in the efficient selection of germline-specific scnRNAs. How is it possible that the truly enormous number of pairing interactions implied can occur in such a short time, just a few hours? RNA-RNA pairing interactions would probably have to be assisted by dedicated molecular machinery. Unfortunately, our current knowledge of the mechanism involved is very limited. My proposed research focuses on studying proteins involved in RNA-mediated epigenetic programming of genome rearrangements and identifying novel candidates that may be implicated in this process. The goal is to build a comprehensive model that would explain the extraordinarily complex system. My previous work has identified the two paralogous and nearly identical RNA-binding proteins Nowa1 and 2 as being essential for programmed DNA deletions by playing a central role in the RNA scanning process. I plan to investigate the thermodynamic aspect of the massive genomic subtraction that is facilitate by Nowa and Piwi proteins, that allow compare and eliminate millions of RNA molecules in a very fast and accurate manner. Since our understanding of epigenetic processes in ciliates is limited by the number of characterized genes, I plan to apply different methods in order to identify novel candidates to be involved in developmental genome rearrangements. This step seems crucial to fully understand such a complex biological phenomenon.Another important questions addressed in this proposal is whether whole-genome reorganization process has an influence on changes in gene expression, whether environmental changes can induce epigenetic modifications that affect gene expression, and whether these modifications can be transmitted across sexual generations. Although it is now clear that experimentally induced epigenetic changes can be transmitted to sexual progeny, it remains to be determined how prevalent such processes are in nature. The question is whether the presence of the epigenetic control of genome content has any evolutionary or adaptive significance. In other words: how ciliates benefit from having such a complicated development? The objective is to find a link between non-Mendelian inheritance and environmental adaptation.

741	Dr SUSAN RHODES	University of Glasgow	None	2013-09-01	2016-07-31	Investigation of JAK2 targets in haematological malignancy	The myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are haematological disorders with significant complications, particularly vascular events and inflammatory responses linked to increased risk of thrombosis. The JAK/STAT pathway is important for normal haemopoiesis and inflammatory responses. Activation of JAK2, especially via the V617F mutation, is a common occurrence in MPN. This laboratory-based, in vitro study will use CD34+ cells to generate induced pluripotent stem cells to investigate how V617F JAK2 affects primitive HSC and more differentiated haemopoietic progenitors. To complement this, FDCP Mix progenitor cell models expressing wild-type and V617F JAK2 will also be generated. This will enable detailed gene expression studies (Fluidigm technology) and protein activity (Western blotting, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence), of transcription factors involved in the maintenance of MPN. Of particular interest will be the effects of V617F JAK2 on the inflammatory response, especially alterations in IFN response genes and the transcriptional regulator PML, which forms transcriptionally active centres in nuclear bodies. These cell models will provide sufficient material to investigate epigenetic (ChIPSeq), nuclear proteins (Western blotting) and protein-protein interactions (co-immunoprecipitation). Using these models, the effects of pharmacological inhibition of JAK2 (AT9283, TG101209 and ruxolitinib) can be evaluated through changes in gene expression, metabolic activity, cell viability/apoptosis, cell cycle analysis and colony forming cell assays. Overall this study will identify new targets involved in MPN and determine why current small molecules inhibitors of JAK2 are ineffective in controlling MPN. If new therapeutic targets can be identified these patients could benefit hugely from reduction of disease burden, the associated symptoms and complications.

742	Dr. Sophie POLO	CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS	None	2019-03-01	2024-02-29	Epigenome maintenance in response to DNA damage	Cell viability and homeostasis rely on the stable maintenance of the epigenetic information conveyed by chromatin, which associates DNA and histone proteins in the cell nucleus and governs gene expression programs. Yet, epigenome integrity is challenged during all DNA transactions, including DNA damage repair. While much effort has been devoted to characterizing chromatin alterations in response to DNA damage and how they contribute to the repair response, our knowledge of this fundamental process is largely incomplete, and whether and how epigenetic features are re-established following a genotoxic stress challenge is still unexplored. Thus, a comprehensive framework of the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of epigenome integrity in response to DNA damage is lacking. The present project aims to fill this important gap by profiling the epigenome of repair patches following UVC damage in human cells and by characterizing the molecular players contributing to chromatin restoration/plasticity. I propose an integrated approach that tackles this question at different levels of chromatin organization, from histone and DNA modifications up to higher-order chromatin folding. Building on our unique expertise and through the development of powerful novel methodologies, combining cutting-edge imaging, proteomics and epigenomic technologies, we will elucidate mechanisms for (1) histone modification re-establishment and maintenance and (2) DNA methylation inheritance at repair sites. We will also investigate how repair-associated changes in DNA and histone modifications reflect at the level of (3) higher-order chromatin organization in the tridimensional nuclear space, and dissect (4) functional crosstalks between the epigenetic changes that arise in damaged chromatin. This ambitious research project represents an unprecedented effort towards a comprehensive and integrated understanding of epigenome maintenance mechanisms in response to genotoxic stress.

743	Dr Sarah Daniels	University of Sheffield	None	2013-08-01	2014-04-30	Epigenetic modification of the BRCA1 promoter and breast cancer phenotype	Background Tumours associated with mutations in the Breast Cancer susceptibility 1 gene, BRCA1, are associated with a higher rate of particularly aggressive, overlapping subtypes of breast cancers called the Triple Negative (TN) and basal phenotypes. TN cancers do not express oestrogen, progesterone or ERBB-2 (HER-2) receptors and are associated with a poor prognosis compared with many of the other subtypes. Overall the TN subtype accounts for around 16% of all breast cancers whereas in BRCA1 carriers it accounts for over 50% (Rummel, Varner et al. 2012). It has also been noted that the BRCA1 associated TN phenotype is common in women with a family history of breast cancer where no genetic mutation has been identified (Wong, Southey et al. 2011). This has led to the hypothesis that other mechanisms of inactivation of the BRCA1 gene may be important, with a particular focus on epigenetic gene silencing through aberrant methylation of the BRCA1 promoter. A number of small studies suggest that methylation of the BRCA1 promoter, detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) DNA is associated with TN phenotype cancers (Snell, Krypuy et al. 2008) and that the level of methylation correlates with number of BRCA1 morphological features (Wong, Southey et al 2011). We have preliminary data from 310 women with breast cancer, including 52 with TN breast cancer, that hypermethylation of two individual CpG sites within the BRCA1 promoter in PMBC DNA may distinguish TN from non-TN tumours. Aims Our aims are firstly to determine the relationships between lymphocyte DNA methylation of the BRCA1 gene and (a) BRCA1 methylation in the tumour, (b) BRCA1 protein levels in the tumour, (c) tumour phenotype and behaviour. Secondly we aim to characterise the distribution of BRCA1 methylation in healthy control subjects. Methods Pyrosequencing of bisulphite treated DNA will be used to determine methylation levels at distinct methylation sites (CpGs) using PBMC DNA from 500 cases and 500 control subjects, and matched FFPE tumour samples. Immunohistochemistry will be used to look for BRCA1 protein expression in the tumour specimens. Tumours will also be scored for the presence of BRCA1-like morphological features. Further questions arising from the work that could be addressed as part of a PhD project include development of PBMC methylation levels as biomarkers and mechanistic studies to investigate how BRCA1 is inactivated and how this leads to particular tumour phenotype.

744	Dr Hayley Davis	University of Oxford	None	2013-10-01	2013-10-31	Implementation of an ex-vivo epithelial and myofibroblast co-culture technique to explore epithelial-mesenchymal interaction in intestinal tumorigenesis	Intestinal cells have an extremely high turnover rate, with proliferative capacity and differentiation status regulated by complex interacting networks of morphogenetic signalling pathways including Wnt and Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signalling. Intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts (ISEMFs) are believed to contribute to these signalling networks by expressing secreted BMP ligands and antagonists. Recent work using ex vivo intestinal cell culture has questioned the role of the mesenchymal cell component in the formation of the epithelial crypt-villus axis, as asymmetric, self organising epithelial cell structures can form in vitro using media morphogen supplementation in the absence of a mesenchymal niche. Our lab have shown that dysregulation of tissue compartmental morphogen signalling promotes tumourigenesis in both humans and mice as aberrant epithelial expression of the BMP antagonist GREM1 is the cause of Hereditary Mixed Polyposis Syndrome (HMPS) and a recently developed mouse model expressing Grem1 ectopically throughout the epithelial crypt-villus axis developed a profound intestinal polyposis. Despite epithelial Grem1 expression occurring throughout the intestine in this model, the majority of crypts were morphologically normal and polyps found as discrete entities. My hypothesis is that the intestinal mesenchymal compartment is actively involved in stem-cell homeostasis and may act as a homeostatic brake in human and mouse polyposis syndromes by limiting clonogenic growth to initiated cells that undergo somatic epigenetic and genetic transformation. I plan to test this using a number of unique tools developed in the Wang lab in New york. These include a novel transgenic reporter mice in which Grem1 expressing ISEMF are fluorescently labelled, allowing the identifiation and separation of Grem1 expressing (putative stem cell niche ISMEF) and non expressing (non niche derived) intestinal myofibroblasts, and an epithelial-myofibroblast organoid co-culture technique. This will allow me to address the following questions: 1. Is there functional heterogeneity among ISEMFs that contributes to morphogen gradient polarity along the intestinal crypt-villus axis? 2. Can adherent ISMEF provide the secreted ligands necessary for epithelial organoid growth in the absence of media supplementation? 3. Can ISEMF (niche and non-niche derived) act as a homeostatic brake on initiated epithelial cell clonogenic growth? This travel grant would help me with my career development by expanding my academic horizons, learning a valuable co-culture technique for our future work on epithelial-mesenchymal interaction and cementing a developing collaboration between ours and Dr Wang's laboratory.

745	Professor Simon Ward	University of Sussex	None	2012-11-01	2014-10-31	Identification and characterisation of novel, small molecule inhibitors of TDP1 by fragment screening	Background- Topoisomerases regulate DNA topology and are fundamental to many aspects of chromosome metabolism. Topoisomerase-1-poisons (topotecan, irinotecan) are used in the treatment of lung, ovarian, and colorectal cancers; however, tumour drug resistance is common, limiting the clinical efficacy of this type of therapy. One potential cause of tumour drug resistance could be the over-expression of activities that repair Topoisomerase-1 (Top1)-linked DNA breaks, such as tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) which can cleave the Top1 peptide from DNA termini. Data from in house studies suggest that TDP1 expression or activity may directly correlate with the tumour cell response to Top1 poisons and so TDP1 activity in tumours may determine the extent of response to Top1 poisons. Importantly, data mining suggests that expression of TDP1 varies greatly in cancer cell lines and primary tumours. We propose that a TDP1 inhibitor could have broad clinical utility as both a single agent in tumour genetic/epigenetic backgrounds sensitive to TDP1 inhibition and also as a combination agent with established Top1 poisons. Aims- Identification of novel small molecule hit series as TDP1 inhibitors with evidence for cellular modulation of TDP1 and confidence of suitability for lead optimisation. Methods- Biophysical screening techniques (thermal shift, NMR, X-ray crysallography) will be used to identify low molecular weight molecules that bind to TDP1. Medicinal chemistry driven optimisation of these compounds will improve binding potency, to be evaluated in our biochemical assays (TDP-1 activity assay, Alkaline Comet and Clonogenic Survival assays). Mode of action work will focus on mechanisms of enzyme inhibition, characterisation of binding sites and evaluation of cellular markers. Access to a well annotated clinical sample collection will allow evaluation of TDP1 inhibitors vs. clinical samples (e.g. colorectal, breast, lung, and head-and-neck). How the results of this research will be used- The results from this research will initiate a lead optimisation program to identify a pre-clinical candidate molecule. Such molecules would allow exploration of the translational and therapeutic relevance of TDP1 and its impact on Top1 function.	Cancer Research UK	Project Award	None	None
746	Dr Matthew Fuchter	Imperial College London	None	2017-03-01	2020-02-29	Profiling the ‘Methylome’ Targets of the Histone Lysine Methyltransferases: DOT1L	Background: The histone lysine methyltransferases (HKMTs) are epigenetic enzymes that catalyse methylation of target lysine residues. Aberrant histone methylation has central importance in cancer development and maintenance. The histone 3 lysine 79 (H379) HKMT DOT1L has become a major epigenetic target in acute leukemia with MLL translocations; which has led to the clinical development of EPZ-5676, a DOT1L inhibitor for use in this disease. Despite this, there are still important questions surrounding DOT1L (cancer) biology. Aims: To date, no suitable technologies exist for defining the specific contribution of a single HKMT to the global protein "methylome". We aim to develop a novel chemical biological technology, using a traceable HKMT-cofactor system, that will enable single HKMT methylome profiling, in this case, DOT1L methylome profiling. We will then apply this approach to understanding DOT1L biology, particularly in MLL-rearranged leukaemia. Methods: WPI will concern the development of the core technology. We will design and employ a synthetic ("bumped") co-factor that is selectively utilised by DOT1L; selectivity derived from a naturally-occurring structural pocket ("hole") in the active site. This synthetic co-factor will contain an isotopically "heavy" labelled methyl group (CD3), so newly (and selectively) deposited marks can be distinguished from endogenous methylation using mass spectrometry. Building on preliminary (unpublished) data, we will fully develop and optimise this technology for profiling of DOT1L substrates. WPII will employ our technology to identify and validate new DOT1L substrates and characterise their functional role in cancer development and maintenance. Given the dependence of MLL-rearranged leukaemia on DOT1L, and the clinical progression of DOT1L inhibitors for patients with MLL-rearranged leukaemia, initial focus will be placed on understanding such substrates in models of this disease. Longer term, other cancer models will be employed, including breast cancer. How the results of this research will be used: Once validated, the developed technology should lead to highly significant insight into DOT1L cancer biology. It may lead to the discovery of other DOT1L substrates or other DOT1L dependent events in cancer, which may help define further cancer subtypes/treatment regimes suitable for application of a specific DOT1L inhibitor.

Still, we are lacking insight into the functional interplay between different types of chromatin modifications and the mechanisms assuring their stable inheritance. Resolving these problems will be essential for a better understanding of the molecular basis of cell identity, i.e. the cellular resistance against reprogramming towards pluripotency or other cell fates, and the significance of epigenetic change in ageing and age-related disease.Studying the complex phenotype of a Tdg disruption in mouse, we learned that processes involving this DNA repair protein stabilize epigenetic signatures at promoters of developmentally important genes 1. More recently, we found that TDG associates with and controls CGI methylation genome-wide, and that it might also be involved in demethylation of non-CpG sequences in differentiating cells. These and other observations strongly suggest that a TDG dependent DNA repair pathway has evolved to maintain epigenetic rather than genetic stability. TDG is targeted to specific genomic loci, where controls DNA methylation, apparently by initiating excision repair of erroneously methylated cytosine bases. This is a highly attractive model, providing for the first time a mechanistic concept for the surveillance and maintenance of epigenetic landscapes in genomes. It is well-supported by genetic evidence but now needs to be explored in greater detail by addressing underlying molecular pathways and mechanisms. The research proposed here focuses on the most important questions that arise at this point, the evidence based, underlying hypothesis being: “TDG controls epigenetic stability at the level of DNA methylation and histone modifications. It contributes structurally, together with long non-coding RNAs, to the targeted assembly of histone modifying protein complexes, and its catalytic activity is required to initiate DNA repair to correct irregularly methylated cytosine bases at such sites. To investigate this hypothesis, I am proposing a research plan with the following objectives:Objective 1: Defining pathway(s) and mechanisms of TDG-mediated control of epigenetic states at CpG islands.Objective 2: Exploring the role of TDG in DNA strand-specific methylation at non-CpG sequences in differentiating cells.Objective 3: Clarifying the role of RNAs in the epigenetic function of TDG.These objectives will be addressed in three lines of experimental approaches. The expected outcome will provide novel insight (i) into the molecular pathways and functions associated with the genome-wide TDG-dependent maintenance of epigenetic and genetic stability of CpG islands, (ii) into a newly discovered role of the same pathway in the clearance of non-CpG methylation during cell lineage commitment, and (iii) into the role of long non-coding RNAs in these processes. A successful completion of the project will significantly advance knowledge about basic epigenetic mechanisms, which will be of high relevance for stems cell- and cancer biology, as well as for the booming research field of cellular reprogramming.

The loss of structural brush border proteins is generally believed to be a consequence, rather than a cause, of the loss of differentiation and polarization occurring during tumor progression. We have recently demonstrated that the loss of MYO1A, a brush border structural protein, drives the tumorigenic process in colorectal cancer (PNAS 2012;109(5):1530). The loss of MYO5B, another brush border myosin, has recently been shown to disrupt the epithelial brush border. Moreover, MYO5B is located in chromosome 18q21, the genomic region most frequently deleted in colorectal tumors, and the loss of MYO5B expression or promoter methylation contribute to the oncogenic process of gastric tumors and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, respectively. Here we propose to use isogenic in vitro systems, animal models and the screening of large human tumor collections to investigate the role of MYO5B in colorectal cancer progression. We will investigate genetic/epigenetic mechanisms of MYO5B inactivation. we will also investigate the mechanisms of tumor suppression of MYO5B. In addition, we will use a murine animal model to investigate Myo5b tumor suppression in vivo and high through-put screening to dissect the underlying molecular mechanisms. Finally, we will investigate the association between MYO5B and survival of patients with different tumor stages. Collectively, these experiments will significantly contribute to elucidate the novel role of the loss of polarization/differentiation in the early stages of colorectal tumorigenesis, and may validate MYO5B as a novel prognostic marker for colorectal cancer patients.

TBX2 is an oncogenic transcription factor known to drive breast cancer proliferation. We have identified Cystatin 6 (CST6) as a consistently repressed TBX2 target. CST6 is a proposed tumour suppressor gene (TSG) and expression of CST6 in TBX2-expressing breast cancer cells induced apoptosis whilst non-tumorigenic breast cells remained unaffected. Functionally, CST6 is a protease inhibitor with extremely high affinity for the cancer-associated enzyme Legumain (LGMN). We have developed a series of small compound LGMN inhibitors (LGMNi's) which selectively kill TBX2/LGMN expressing breast cancer cell lines. Aims To define the TBX2 transcriptional repression complex To characterise TBX2/KAP1/HP1 epigenetic events in breast cancers To develop genetic screens of CST6 biology and LGMNi responses Techniques and Methodology Aim 1: Cell signalling methodologies (RqPCR, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, apoptosis/senescence assays, cell cycle analyses) will investigate the cellular effects of CST6 knockdown in non-tumorigenic cells. Lentiviral generation of CST6-promoter luciferase reporter cell lines and esiRNA screens will be used to identify epigenetic events occurring at the CST6 promoter. Aim 2: ChIP-seq for TBX2 and known interactors (HP1,KAP1) and DNA Methylation array analyses will be overlapped with a TBX2 microarray differential genelist to identify markers (e.g. CST6) co-ordinately regulated by this complex and pyrosequencing will validate candidate methylated genomic regions. Aim 3: Genome-wide screening using a CRISPR (GeCKO) library to look for (i) events promoting emergence of CST6-deficient breast cancers, and (ii) genes whose loss-of-function contributes to resistance to LGMNi's. Both screens will be validated in vitro (si/shRNA) and in vivo modelling (orthotopic implantation of luciferase-labelled lines) used to evaluate efficacy of LGMNi's using IVIS. Post mortem examination of mice will test utilities of selected PD biomarkers for LGMNi's. Impact on breast cancer research This proposal highlights a novel breast cancer pathway linked to poor outcomes which we will target with new anti-cancer (LGMNi) drugs.

750	Dr Duncan Sproul	University of Edinburgh	None	2016-09-01	2022-08-31	The impact of genetic interactions on DNA methylation in breast cancer	Background:Epigenetic dysfunction is a near universal feature of carcinogenesis. DNA methylation alterations affect key breast cancer genes such as BRCA1 suggesting their importance to carcinogenesis and progression. However, the mechanisms underpinning such alterations in DNA methylation are unknown, so their significance remains unclear.My recent work suggests epigenetic marks are strongly programmed by the underlying DNA sequence. This means that sequence variants are likely to be an important and underexplored influence on breast cancer epigenomes.Aims:This project aims to understand the role of the genome in programming the epigenetic mark DNA methylation in breast cancer through two aims.1. Define the extent to which germ-line and somatic DNA sequence variants modulate local levels of DNA methylation in breast tumours in vivo.2. Understand how the effects of regulatory variants on DNA methylation and gene expression interact and how such variants impact on clinical phenotypes.Methods:I will elucidate the frequency to which germ-line and somatic sequence variants affect DNA methylation in breast cancer through machine-learning analyses of HER2-driven mouse mammary tumours and clinical high-grade luminal breast tumours. The interaction between variant-modulated alterations in DNA methylation and gene expression will be tested using genome editing technologies and the promoter of BRCA1 as a paradigm. The phenotypic impact of BRCA1 regulatory mutations will be assessed through engineering into mice. These synergistic approaches reinforce one another to uncover the global impact of sequence variation on DNA methylation, the mechanistic details underlying these effects and their clinical relevance. How the results of this research will be used:This project uses state-of-the-art computational and laboratory approaches to leverage genetics towards tackling our lack of understanding regarding the impact of DNA sequence variation on epigenetic alterations in cancer. In doing so, it impacts on our understanding of the regulation of a key breast and ovarian cancer risk gene, BRCA1, and provides new approaches to delineate the contribution of regulatory variants to carcinogenesis and progression.

New technologies are driving an explosion of high-dimensional datasets that will sustain a continuing need for new methods, theory and computationally efficient software. My proposal has two parts that will address the statistical challenges and creation of resources at the frontier of the science in this area. The methods development will be driven by, and applied to, several cutting-edge datasets in the fields of human disease genetics, population genetics and plant and animal breeding, guaranteeing impact on exciting scientific questions. The first part concerns a wide circle of ideas around haplotype estimation, genotype imputation and analysis of sequencing data. The overarching aim is to provide a suite of methods that can estimate haplotypes and impute genotypes in a unified and computationally efficient manner. The methodological development will allow analysis of tens or hundreds of thousands of subjects, be able to estimate haplotypes in related samples and general pedigrees and be applicable to next-generation sequence data. In addition, we will work to create a reference set of haplotypes from tens of thousands of European and worldwide samples that will form a central resource for human disease and population genetic studies. The second part concerns the development of models for high-dimensional phenotypic data in genome-wide association studies. This is poorly developed area of human disease genetics with great potential for methods development and wide ranging applications. Specific goals will be (a) development of sparse Bayesian methods for multiple correlated phenotypes in related samples, (b) imputation of missing phenotype data (c) extension to directed acyclic models (DAGs) of phenotype association (d) causal inference in observational studies in genetics (e) Bayesian models for integration of high-dimensional genetic, epigenetic, exposure and phenotypic data.

While vascular inflammation can be visualised using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), as a glucose analogue this method lacks cell specificity and is unreliable for coronary imaging owing to myocardial signal overspill. My research has shown that 68Ga-DOTATATE, a somatostatin receptor-2 PET ligand, provides a more accurate readout of macrophage-related atherosclerotic inflammation than 18F-FDG, with superior ability to distinguish high-risk versus lower-risk coronary lesions. In three parallel studies, I will test the clinical utility of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET to: i) quantify treatment response to high-intensity lipid-lowering with statins and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors in patients with stable cardiovascular disease and familial hypercholesterolaemia; ii) predict disease progression post-myocardial infarction by identifying individuals with “residual” on-treatment coronary arterial inflammation; and iii) diagnose large-vessel vasculitis and monitor treatment response. 68Ga-DOTATATE imaging will also be compared to established MRI, CT, and intravascular imaging markers of atherosclerotic disease severity; and validated in vasculitis using autoradiography, histology and gene expression analyses. Moreover, transcriptomic and epigenetic profiling of monocyte-derived macrophages will be performed to better understand mechanisms underlying residual inflammatory risk defined by 68Ga-DOTATATE. This research will accelerate translation of 68Ga-DOTATATE inflammation imaging to the clinic.	Wellcome Trust	Clinical Research Career Development Fellowship	716938.0	GBP

Process compartmentalization and spatial location of genes modulate the transcriptional output of the genomes. However, how the interplay between genome structure and gene regulation is established and maintained is still unclear. The aim of this project is to explore whether the genome 3D structure acts as an information source for modulating transcription in response to external stimuli. With a genuine interdisciplinary team effort, we will study the conformation of the genome at various integrated levels, from the nucleosome fiber to the distribution of chromosomes territories in the nuclear space. We will generate high-resolution 3D models of the spatial organization of the genomes of distinct eukaryotic cell types in interphase to identify differences in the chromatin landscape. We will follow the time course of structural changes in response to cues that affect gene expression either permanently or transiently. We will analyze the changes in genome structure during the stable trans-differentiation of immortalized B cells to macrophages and during the transient hormonal responses of differentiated cells. We plan to establish novel functional strategies, based on targeted and high-throughput reporter assays, to assess the relevance of the spatial environment on gene regulation. Using sophisticated modeling and computational approaches, we will combine high-resolution data from chromosome interactions, super-resolution images and omics information. Our long-term plan is to implement a 3D browser for the comprehensive mapping of chromatin properties and genomic features, to better understand how external signals are integrated at the genomic, epigenetic and structural level to orchestrate changes in gene expression that are cell specific and dynamic.

They are mostly based on DNA methylation and post-transcriptional histone modifications associated with transcriptional suppression that are self-sustaining once they have been deposited on a chromatin domain. Current research is unraveling the composition and function of the molecular machineries recruited to chromatin to induce these repressive states, and the mechanisms that once established support their stability and conservation through cell generations. We are interested in developing a new approach to exogenously induce the assembly of such complexes at a predetermined locus of the genome and usurp its transcription suppressive activity to permanently silence gene with a negative role in human disease. The advantage of such “epigenetic” therapy would be that it does not require introducing mutations or breaks in the DNA, as it occurs with current approaches based on integrating vectors or engineered nucleases, thus potentially providing for a much safer strategy. Moreover, the hit and run nature of an epigenetic silencing induction complex lends itself to transient delivery of Artificial Transcriptional Repressors (ATRs), engineered protein made up of an effector repressive domain fused with an artificially redirected DNA binding domain specific for the target gene. We will model this approach in human cell lines and test its feasibility in clinically relevant human primary Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor cells carrying within the genome reporter cassettes engineered with multiple binding sites for ATRs. Once we have establishes a proof-ofprinciple of the approach we will explore its efficiency on a human genetic disease.	Telethon Italy	HSR-TIGET Grant Award	297358.28	EUR

758	Mariusz Nowacki	University of Berne	Institut für Zellbiologie Departement Biologie Universität Bern	2010-04-01	2013-03-31	Understanding Epigenetic Mechanisms of Developmental Genome Rearrangements.	The scientific goal of this proposal is to contribute to our understanding of RNA-mediated epigenetic mechanisms of genome regulation in eukaryotes. Choosing ciliated protozoa as model organisms gives a wonderful opportunity to study the incredibly complex epigenetic mechanism of programming large-scale developmental rearrangements of the genome. In ciliates, germline and somatic functions are ensured by two different kinds of nuclei, the diploid micronucleus and a DNA rich macronucleus. Sexual events are initiated by meiosis of the micronucleus, and following fertilization, the parental macronucleus is lost and replaced by a new one that develops, like the new micronucleus, from the zygotic nucleus. Macronuclear development involves extensive rearrangements of the germline genome, including elimination of transposons and other repeated sequences and the precise excision of numerous single-copy Internal Eliminated Sequences (IESs). The massive DNA rearrangement makes ciliates the perfect model organism to study this aspect of germline-soma differentiation. This process is proposed to be regulated by an RNA-mediated homology-dependent comparison of the germline and somatic genomes contained in different nuclei. If it is confirmed to occur at the scale of the whole genome, such a genomic subtraction would be one of the most fascinating examples of the use of RNA-mediated epigenetic regulation, and of a specialized RNA interference pathway, to convey non-Mendelian inheritance in eukaryotes. The Paramecium ‘genome scanning’ model raises many interesting questions, which are also relevant to other RNA-mediated regulation systems. One of the most intriguing is a ‘thermodynamic’ problem: the model assumes that a very complex population of small RNAs representing the entire germline genome (possibly of the order of 10 million different scnRNAs) can be compared to longer transcripts representing the entire rearranged genome of the maternal macronucleus (72 Mb), resulting in the efficient selection of germline-specific scnRNAs, which are able to target DNA deletions in the developing nucleus. How is it possible that the truly enormous number of pairing interactions implied can occur in such a short time, just a few hours? RNA-RNA pairing interactions would probably have to be assisted by a dedicated molecular machinery. Unfortunately, our current knowledge of the mechanism involved is very limited. Nevertheless, my previous work (Nowacki et al. 2005, Curr Biol) has identified the two RNA-binding proteins Nowa1 and 2 as being essential for programmed DNA deletions in Paramecium, and the available evidence suggests that they play a central role in the genome scanning mechanism. Therefore, the first part of this proposal focuses on characterizing the function of these proteins. The specific aims are: (i) Investigating possible protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions of Nowa in the parental macronucleus, where they may be implicated in the pairing between the scnRNA and the maternal “protective” transcripts.(ii) Studying trans-nuclear transport of Nowa to determine the exact role of the C-terminal domain.(iii) Molecular interactions of Nowa at the last step of the scanning process taking place in the developing macronucleus. Here I would like to determine how the selected scnRNA find their targets and what proteins accompany Nowa during this process.(iv) Characterizing new Nowa family members: Nowa3, Nowa4 and Nowa5.My recent study (Nowacki et al. 2008, Nature) demonstrates that maternal RNA templates can orchestrate massive genome rearrangements in another ciliate, Oxytricha, supporting an epigenetic model for sequence-dependent comparison between germline and somatic genomes. The work shows the existence of maternal RNA that could guide DNA assembly, and that disruption of specific RNA molecules disables rearrangement of the corresponding gene. Injection of artificial templates reprograms the DNA rearrangement pathway, suggesting that RNA molecules guide genome rearrangement. The results suggest that the entire somatic genome might be equally transcribed during a narrow window of development, and the resulting RNA copy of the genome must then be transported to the developing somatic nucleus of the sexual progeny to guide rearrangement. This implies the existence of a new system of inheritance, independent of the germline genome, where somatic genetic information is inherited through a transient RNA genome. The new system of inheritance discovered in Oxytricha, although closely related, appears to be different from the one described in Paramecium and Tetrahymena. These two developed a different, RNAi-like mechanism. Second part of this proposal consists of two projects that continue the studies on genome unscrambling in the ciliate Oxytricha trifallax. The specific aims are: (v) Identifying and testing candidate genes involved in Oxytricha genome rearrangement. I recently used RNAi to identify a group of TBE transposases with a role in genome rearrangement (Nowacki et al., 2009, Science). Other candidate genes with expression during development will be identified via parallel cDNA sequencing and tested similarly via RNAi.(vi) Characterizing the recently discovered developmentally regulated small RNAs in Oxytricha. Most of the small RNAs can be mapped onto the macronuclear genome. This makes them ‘orthogonally’ different from predicted scnRNAs, which should derive from micronuclear sequences that are eliminated during development of the macronucleus. Large-scale sequencing and sequence analysis of this novel class of developmental small RNA may help understanding the extraordinarily complex genome processing in Oxytricha.

Pluripotent cells can both self-renew and differentiate into cells of all three germ layers making them the focus of much recent research in light of their promise for future stem cell therapies. These cells are enriched in certain factors and pathways compared to differentiated cells, including in the KAP1 (kr ppel-associated box domain-(KRAB)-associated protein 1) and KRAB-containing zinc finger protein system, which we recently identified to bind to and repress endogenous retroviral (ERV) seq uences. There are some three hundred KRAB-ZFPs encoded by mammalian genomes, most of which are uncharacterized. I found this pathway to impact on the expression of bivalent genes, with ERV sequences that escape repression acting as enhancers. This illustrates that ERV sequences, widespread in mammalian genomes, can regulate developmental genes through KAP1. Finally, I showed that KAP1 is responsible for the establishment of de novo DNA methylation at ERV-containing loci through KRAB-ZFPs and the histone methyltransferase ESET. Altogether, this work places the KAP1 / ESET pathway at the heart of pluripotency. My focus is now to identify the factors (notably KRAB-ZFPs) that target KAP1 to specific genomic loci and to dissect the epigenetic pathways through which histone and DNA methylation marks are induced at ERVs and nearby genes.

Among these are changes in circadian rhythms, the endogenous 24 hour cycles governing nearly all aspects of mammalian physiology and behavior, including sleep-wake cycle. During ageing, one of the most common and troublesome events are sleep disorders, implying fundamental changes within the circadian pacemakers that gate sleep patterns. It is unclear how ageing impacts on the molecular clockworks and what the underpinning mechanisms are. Epigenetic modifications have recently been implicated in the regulation of circadian clocks. Epigenetic processes are also recognized as a hallmark of ageing. Remarkably, sirtuins are implicated in both processes through their actions on the interface between energy metabolism and cellular senescence. These findings implicate common epigenetic changes in ageing process and altered circadian pacemaker function. The primary aims of the proposal are: 1) To define how ageing affects the overall organization of the molecular clock machinery in animals and man. 2) To test the hypothesis that ageing may impact on the balance of acetylation/deacetylation activity or histone methylation state in pacemaker cells, which leads to alterations in overt output rhythms. 3) To probe the possibility that pharmacological/genetic manipulation of the epigenetic-regulated pathways may counteract age-related changes in circadian rhythms. In this proposal, I will use young and aged transgenic reporter mice to define changes within circadian clocks, including period, amplitude, resetting response and clock gene activity in neural and peripheral pacemaker cells using real-time bioluminescent imaging and biochemical approaches over multiple circadian cycles. I will study age-related changes in expression and activity of CLOCK and SIRT1, acetylation or methylation state of histones and key clock proteins in tissues and primary cells, complemented by the use of an oxidative stress-induced cellular ageing model. The impact of manipulating SIRT1 activity on circadian clocks will also be examined. Translational studies using human fibroblasts isolated from young and elderly subjects will be undertaken using clock gene reporter technologies. The molecular rhythms thereby revealed will be correlated with age and chronotype, as assessed by standard questionnaire. Circadian clocks have pleiotropic effects and disrupted circadian rhythms correlate with age-associated sleep disorders and other pathologies. This project aims to define the mechanisms underlying age-associated changes within circadian system in animals and man. Long term, outcomes from this work could aid therapeutic drug design against age-related ailments, for which targeting SIRT1 is already an appealing candidate.

This process leads to major shifts in gene expression profile and can lead to a change in cell fate. In mammals, under physiological conditions epigenetic reprogramming occurs in the course of development and potentially to some extent also as a part of the regenerative processes during wound healing. Aberrantly, similar processes that reverse cell fate decisions might be partially recapitulated during cellular dedifferentiation observed in cancer. In vitro, several reprogramming systems have been described that could be used to revert somatic cell phenotype and to regenerate pluripotency: somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), generation of induced pluripotent cells (iPS), cell fusion or permeabilisation of cells followed by incubation with protein extracts - amongst others. However, these in vitro reprogramming systems are very inefficient, show high degree of variability, and often generate cells with intermediate phenotypes. In order to gain deep mechanistic insights into the molecular processes underlying epigenetic reprogramming we decided to focus on the naturally occurring reprogramming that operates efficiently in the course of embryonic development. |Our laboratory uses mouse zygotes and developing germ line (primordial germ cells, PGCs) as models where epigenetic reprogramming occurs naturally in vivo. In order to decipher molecular mechanisms underlying these reprogramming processes we concentrate on 2 main areas:1) Mechanisms underlying DNA demethylation and erasure of genomic imprints. |2) Interplay between DNA demethylation and chromatin dynamics Detailed understanding of the naturally occurring reprogramming processes will add to our ability to efficiently reprogram cells in vitro.

Through series of cell divisions and differentiation processes this cell will eventually give rise to the whole organism containing hundreds of specialised cell. While the cells at the onset of development have the capacity to generate all cell types (ie are toti-or pluripotent), this developmental capacity is progressively lost as the cells undertake cell fate decisions. At the molecular level, the memory of these events is laid down in a complex layer of epigenetic modifications at both the DNA and the chromatin level. Unidirectional character of the developmental progress dictates that the key acquired epigenetic modifications are stable and inherited through subsequent cell divisions. This paradigm is, however, challenged during cellular reprogramming that requires de-differentiation (nuclear transfer, induced pluripotent stem cells, wound healing and regeneration in lower organisms) or a change in cell fate (transdifferentiation). Despite intense efforts of numerous research teams, the molecular mechanisms of these processes remain enigmatic. In order to understand cellular reprogramming at the molecular level, this proposal takes advantage of epigenetic reprogramming processes that occur naturally during mouse development. By using mouse fertilised zygote and mouse developing primordial germ cells we will investigate novel molecular components implicated in the genome-wide erasure of DNA methylation. Additionally, by using a unique combination of the developmental models with the state of the art ultra-sensitive LC/MS and genomics approaches we propose to investigate the dynamics and the interplay between DNA and RNA modifications during these key periods of embryonic development characterised by genome-wide epigenetic changes .

Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that affects an increasing number of people in the United Kingdom. In comparison to many cancers, melanoma disproportionately affects younger individuals and, whilst readily treatable when caught early, melanoma is incurable when it has spread from its original site. Melanomas develop from melanocytes: specialised skin cells that give colour to skin and hair and are responsible for moles and freckles. We know that melanoma development is strongly linked to exposure to sunlight – especially that which leads to sunburn. We also know that there are inherited tendencies to melanoma. Large genetic studies of melanoma patients have identified many differences within the genetic DNA code, known as SNPs (‘snips’), that are more common in melanoma patients and account for some of this inherited risk. It is not clear how these changes actually increase the risk of developing melanoma however. We know from studies of other diseases that genetic risk regions can often control the ‘switching on and off’ of genes in cell types and parts of the body relevant to developing the disease. In this study I will look at how genes are turned on and off in melanocytes after exposure to light. I will explore how this varies between individuals and whether exposure to light can cause more permanent, so called epigenetic, alterations to how genes are activated. This work has the potential to help us understands how melanocytes normally respond to light exposure and how genetic variation increases the risk of developing melanoma.

It is the third largest cause of death worldwide and has a direct NHS cost of >£800m/year. It is characterized by progressive airflow limitation, with fibrosis and obstruction of the small airways, loss of lung elasticity and emphysema. Thickening of small airways is caused by fibrosis and an increase in airway smooth muscle (ASM) mass and airway wall inflammation. No treatments halt this progressive airflow limitation. Airway remodelling is regulated through changes in oxidative stress and epigenetic reprogramming particularly histone acetylation. We hypothesize that lysine acetylation controls the oxidant-antioxidant enzyme balance of ASM and fibroblasts and that this, in turn, determines their activation, proliferation and differentiation status leading to increased ASM mass and fibrosis. Inhibition of lysine acetylation will reverse the proliferation and phenotypic changes of lung fibroblasts and ASM cells in COPD and will arrest disease progression.

Current views of eukaryotic gene regulation emphasize structural and epigenetic characteristics of chromatin itself as well as the spatial disposition of chromatin domains in the three-dimensional (3D) space of the nucleus. A major challenge is to elucidate not only the 3D architecture of interphase chromatin but also to integrate this spatial information with epigenetic modifications and chromatin mobility in vivo. The purpose of the work proposed here is to study how epigenetic processes impact 3D interphase chromosome disposition, dynamics and expression in living plant cells. The experiments will be performed using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, for which the necessary tools are available: (1) transgenic lines with fluorescent tags at different chromosomal sites, which can be viewed in interphase nuclei of living plants; and (2) mutants impaired in various types of epigenetic gene silencing. Results from these investigations will help to integrate epigenetic modifications into a comprehensive picture of the the 3D organization and dynamic nature of interphase chromatin in living cells.

Prof.Dr. Peter VALENT	Medical University of Vienna	None	2013-03-01	2021-02-28	Myeloproliferative Neoplasms	Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are the most frequent myeloid malignancies, with an incidence of 20-30 patients/100,000/year. Although major advances in the treatment of MPN have been achieved in recent years, most MPN are still incurable disorders with substantial morbidity and mortality. An emerging problem in the management of MPN is drug-resistance. During the past 4 years, SFB F47 (www.sfb-mpn.at) has contributed substantially to the development of new markers and targets in various MPN, including JAK2 V617F-mutated MPN, CALR-mutated MPN, KIT D816V+ mastocytosis, and Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Novel targets, like STAT5, BRD4, CDK6, or CD52, were studied and validated in animal models as well as in patient-derived cells using functional read-outs, specific targeted drugs, and various iRNA-approaches. The consortium also defined target expression-profiles and functional roles of individual targets in leukemic stem cells (LSC) in various MPN. F47 established a number of complementary technologies and core-platforms through which individual projects and efforts were bundled and highly effective collaborations with synergistic outcomes were installed. The F47-network also includes a robust biobank connected to a clinical dataset-platform through which the diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic potentials of candidate-genes were validated. In the next project-period (2017-2021), F47 will further develop these concepts and target-specific approaches, following the basic hypothesis that deeper understanding of the function and role of molecular targets and target-networks should lead to the development of improved anti-neoplastic (LSC-eradicating) treatment concepts. The consortium includes six institutions: The Medical University of Vienna (PI: Sabine Zoechbauer-Mueller and Peter Valent) provides translational concepts and facilities, and has a focus on LSC, LSC-niche interactions, and epigenetic regulation in MPN cells. The Institute for Molecular Pathology (PI: Johannes Zuber) has a major interest in epigenetic targets and focuses on BET bromodomain-inhibition. The Center for Molecular Medicine (PI: Robert Kralovics and Giulio Superti-Furga) explores mutation-profiles and drug-target interaction-profiles in MPN cells and provides advanced drug-screen and proteomic-facilities. The University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna (PI: Veronika Sexl) and the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research (PI: Richard Moriggl) provide robust mouse-models and concentrate on STAT5, CDK6, and other drug-targets in MPN. The Children´s Cancer Research Institute (PI: Thomas Lion) has a strong focus on markers and targets in CML and PDGFR-mutated MPN. All F47-groups work closely together and are interconnected via several core-platforms. Each individual project depends on the strong scientific network of F47 which provides a great environment for young researchers and their career, and for those who collaborate in order to establish future clinical trials or robust diagnostic tools. It can be expected that F47 will continue to contribute substantially to a better understanding of mechanisms underlying the etiology, progression, and resistance of MPN, with the ultimate aim to improve therapy and survival in these patients.

Prof. Dr. Stefan GRÄSSLE	Medical University of Innsbruck	None	2007-06-15	2012-06-14	Fungal specific roles of histone deacetylases	Along with other histone modifying enzymes, histone deacetylases (HDACs) are generally accepted as key players in the epigenetic regulation of eukaryotic gene expression removing acetyl groups from specific lysine residues in the amino-terminal tails of the histones. In general, acetylation of histones interferes with the higher order packing of chromatin allowing transcriptional regulators to gain access to the DNA. In addition, acetylation may act as a highly specific signal that enables or at least facilitates the binding of enzymes responsible for replication or transcriptional processes. In recent years we have identified and partly characterized HDACs of different classes in the model organism and filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans. These analyses revealed that some of these enzymes exhibit fungal specific motifs and targets that make them clearly distinguishable from homologous proteins of other eukaryotic species (e.g. yeast or mammalia). Moreover, inactivation of two of these enzymes, the class 2 HDAC HdaA and the class 1 enzyme RpdA, led to a retardation of growth under certain growth conditions or turned out to be essential for the survival of the fungal strains. Interestingly, there is strong evidence that homologous enzymes in related fungal species play similar important roles. The characteristic features and their significance for growth and development of filamentous fungi turn these enzymes into potentially interesting targets for fungal specific HDAC inhibitors - an attractive aspect with respect to the development of new antifungal drugs. Since several Aspergillus strains are not only well known for infection of food and feed crops but have been also reported as causative agents of infections in (immuno-compromised) patients, development of novel antimycotic drugs is highly desirable. The long-term goal of this project is to understand the biological function of HDACs, their mode of action, necessary cofactors and potential target genes in A. nidulans and in filamentous fungi in general.

As the avian embryo develops in a sealed environment, eggs provide an excellent model to study these non-genetic effects. Recent studies on hormone-mediated maternal effects in birds have highlighted the influence of variable yolk steroid hormone concentrations on offspring phenotype (morphology, physiology and behaviour). The concentrations of steroid hormones in egg yolk are modulated by various environmental conditions. Despite numerous studies on these so-called epigenetic effects, the underlying physiological mechanism allowing the female to manipulate yolk hormone concentrations has hardly been elucidated so far. In birds, interactions between stress and reproductive hormones are well-investigated, however, a possible influence of glucocorticoids (GCs) on the follicular synthesis of gonadal steroids and their deposition into the egg has not been explored yet. We hypothesise that elevated plasma GC concentrations of the mother trigger changes in phenotypic properties of her offspring and that this effect is mediated via maternally derived steroid hormones of gonadal origin, which are deposited into the yolk. In the presented study, the consequences of experimentally elevated maternal plasma corticosterone concentrations on yolk steroid hormone concentration and offspring development (physiology and behaviour) will be elucidated. Insight into the underlying physiological mechanism of hormone deposition would greatly benefit the functional and evolutionary approach to the quickly expanding research field. The combination of stress physiology and hormone mediated maternal effects and the analyses of both the causal mechanism and functional consequences will have a broad impact as the field of hormone mediated maternal effects in birds urgently requires input about its underlying physiological mechanisms. This would greatly support the understanding of proximate and ultimate causes of hormone mediated maternal effects in birds.	Austrian Science Fund FWF	Stand-Alone Project	None	None

This rearrangement of the genome is mediated by the product of two genes called recombination activating genes 1 and 2 (RAG1 and RAG2). Rearrangement of the genome is a dangerous process for an organism and is, therefore, strictly regulated at all levels of cellular activity, starting with the regulation of expression of the RAGs themselves. The subject of this application is the study of the regulation of the transcription of these genes during lymphocyte development. The two genes are closely linked and conserved in evolution. Several elements in cis, in the areas of the DNA surrounding the genes, act in concert to effect this regulation by silencing and anti-silencing mechanisms that are still not well understood. Current research indicates that these mechanisms include secondary, epigenetic, regulation of the chromatin architecture of the locus of these genes over a large area. This may also be partly dependent on the action of regulatory RNA molecules, a general mechanism of gene regulation that has been a topic of intense scientific interest in recent years. Insight into the mechanisms involved in the complex regulation of the RAG locus will contribute to the study of gene regulation in general. This research is basic research aimed at improving our understanding of the immune system and our capacity to fight disease.	Austrian Science Fund FWF	Stand-Alone Project	None	None

Prof.Dr. Michael KRAINER	Medical University of Vienna	None	2008-05-01	2011-04-30	Deciphering the TRAIL pathway in Ovarian Cancer	The research of our lab focuses on the pathogenesis of human epithelial ovarian cancer. We want to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools based on a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind this disease. In a previous FWF project we have identified a major role for the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and its functional receptors in ovarian cancer. We could demonstrate, that a high percentage of cases shows a deregulation of the TRAIL induced apoptotic pathway, and that this may be caused by epigenetic downregulation of the TRAIL receptor 1 (DR4) and/or overexpression of an apoptosis inhibiting protein (c-FLIP). Moreover, we observed that ovarian cancers have high TRAIL expression in the tumor microenvironment and that high expression of TRAIL is associated with prolonged survival. Consequently, we want to investigate these important observations in more detail as well as in the broader context of tumor surveillance. Most human tumors eventually continue to grow independently of spontaneous or therapy induced immune responses, a process described as escape from tumor surveillance. There is ample evidence that this happens due to the ability of a fraction of cancer cells to continuously evade potentially effective immune recognition and destruction. Mechanisms include increased induction of thresholds for apoptosis, loss of antigen processing and presentation capabilities of tumor cells, antigenic-loss variants, enhanced negative signaling and decreased activation of NK-cells as well as antigen specific T-cells. All these various processes may act simultaneously making the overall tumor-host interaction extremely complex. In addition, cancer itself also suppresses host immunity by multiple mechanisms. We will set a spotlight on the development of apoptosis resistance in the course of ovarian carcinogenesis, as potential interface between immune system and cancer development. In the proposed experiments we will examine the importance of the TRAIL pathway in spontaneous metastasis of ovarian cancer. We will apply new techniques for co-culture of natural killer cells with ovarian cancer cells, and establish a syngeneic ovarian cancer model in immunocompetent mice, in order to decipher the role of TRAIL in host protection from ovarian tumor metastasis. These new techniques will enable us to provide a novel strategy to describe the critical role of TRAIL in innate immune surveillance of ovarian cancer. The results will have substantial implications for both, the development of spontaneous immunity of cancer cells - and consequently the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer in general - as well as various treatment approaches including immunotherapy, emerging therapeutic options like targeted and deacetylation therapies, and systemic chemotherapy, which continues to represent the standard treatment of advanced ovarian cancer.

This is a complex process that effectively amplifies incoming signals to prevent further damage while the body is repairing. These changes are supported by specific patterns of gene expression that are dynamic and evolve with time. Sometimes the pain persists after the injury has resolved and becomes a chronic pain state indicating maintained sensitization of spinal cord nociceptive networks. Could this be due to aberrant epigenetic modifications? Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and chromatin remodelling regulate high-order chromatin structure crucial to the regulation of gene expression. Epigenetic processes imprint environmental experiences such as social interactions onto the fixed genome and therefore provide a bridge between the genes and the environment by refining neural networks according to experience. These processes are dynamic and reversible but can also result in stable alterations. Their de-regulation has been associated with a broad spectrum of neurological disorders. I will investigate the epigenetic processes that contribute to gene repression and activation in dorsal horn neurons in a model of joint inflammation. 1) DNA methylation is known to inhibit gene transcription. I will investigate DNA methylation status of a small number of genes previously identified. 2) Post-translational modifications of histone proteins, specifically at residues known to modify neuronal network function, regulate access to DNA. These modifications will be mapped onto nociceptive pathways during different phases of joint inflammation. 3) Descending controls from the brain and early life injury modulate pain behaviour. I will look at how descending controls and early life injury can regulate DNA methylation and histone modifications and I will investigate the correlation between epigenetic changes and pain behaviour. 4) Finally, to strengthen this correlation, I will modulate the expression of selected genes under epigenetic controls during joint inflammation and analyse their contribution to the pain state. This will include the investigation of micro-RNAs predicted by gene expression analysis and thought to fine tune neural circuits. This investigation will provide insights into the complex roles of epigenetics in central nervous system plasticity and set the stage for a deeper understanding of the molecular changes that contribute to chronic pain, an area of immense unmet clinical needs.

We discovered several fundamental features of genes under developmental regulation and established the link between the type of core promoter and its responsiveness to long-range regulation, and developed a number of widely used computational methods and data resources for studying the regulatory content of genomes. Our current aim is to understand the molecular and mechanistic basis for different modes of gene regulation associated with the control of cell cycle, multicellular processes and regulation in terminally differentiated cells. In addition to our models of long-range regulation, the newly available epigenomic data contains crucial information for distinguishing these modes in development, differentiation and disease. Our core research program is to identify the features of genes under different modesand regimes of gene regulation. Different genes have regulatory territories that vastly differ in size, are often nested, and exhibit distinct patterns of epigenetic modifications, or succession of such patterns. By investigating genomic regulatory territories, we want to establish sequence features and epigenomic patterns and sequence features associated with different modes of gene regulation. We want to find out which properties of genes, are responsible for the correct sorting and assignment of inputs in complex, nonlinear gene loci. Among the most exciting hypotheses we are currently investigating are the fundamentally different modes of regulation of genes in dividing vs non-dividing, terminally differentiated cells, and time-sharing of core promoters. We plan to investigate how complex input from the cell environment is interpreted by megabase-sized cis-regulatory arrays of these genes to result in tightly coordinated development of complex multicellular structures. Our primary focus is biological insight. Nonetheless, we develop reusable methods for our analysis, to be shared by the community. This has proven to be a highly productive approach for subsequent analyses. In the forthcoming period our method development will focus on i) Transcription factor binding and transcription factor complexes: We are developing a computational toolbox for the analysis and visualisation of large sets of transcription factor binding sites and other regulatory elements and their integration with other types of genome-wide data; ii) Computational methodology for comparative epigenomics – The next several years will witness the rise of the need to analyse hundreds or thousands of epigenomes simultaneously - across tissues, time courses, epidemiological cohorts or different species. Computational capacity expertise and tools for the analysis of this scale are currently largely unavailable. Building on and inspired by methods for the segmentation of epigenomic regions, we plan to build methods for the characterisation of individual regulatory elements and their ensembles around genes under complex regulation.

Two key mechanisms known to regulate the functional state of chromatin in mammals are the methylation of DNA and the post-translational modification of histone proteins. Due to the large number of possible modifications, epigenetic information can be stored in chromatin modification patterns. Chromatin modifications have been shown to regulate all DNA-associated processes, such as transcription, replication, and DNA repair, and play an important role in cell proliferation and differentiation. These functions are intimately linked to the faithful interpretation and inheritance of genetic information and the memory of a cell’s identity. Deregulation of these modifications and their modifying enzymes are implicated in many types of diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders. Many chromatin-regulating factors have been identified that recognise methylated DNA or modified histones. Such effector molecules use a range of different binding domains in order to establish and orchestrate biological events. Since chromatin is a large macromolecular assembly, modifications most likely act in a concerted manner. However, it is still unclear how the information contained in combinatorial modification patterns on the DNA and histones is interpreted. Our aim is to understand how combinations of DNA and histone modifications regulate the activity of chromatin. We employ the tools of chemical biology, biochemistry and proteomics in conjunction with tissue culture and genomic technologies in order to study proteins that can recognise DNA and histone modification patterns in the context of chromatin. We have developed a technique called SILAC nucleosome affinity purification that allows us to identify proteins that bind DNA or histone modifications on in vitro assembled nucleosomes using high-resolution mass spectrometry. We will use this technique for identifying new factors that integrate information contained in multiple chromatin modifications on nucleosomes and chromatin, and for understanding how they operate at the molecular level. We are particularly interested in the molecular mechanisms that underlie epigenetic gene regulation events during DNA replication, tumour formation and differentiation processes. Our research will help elucidate how chromatin modifications regulate cellular processes and how deregulation of normal chromatin function leads to diseases. Our ultimate goal is to identify the critical factors and to understand their molecular and cellular functions in order to develop drugs for epigenetic therapies against diseases such as cancer.

Modifications on histones or on DNA play a central role in the control of gene expression and errors in their regulation often result in diseases such as cancer. These modifications can recruit proteins that regulate chromatin function. Since chromatin is a large macromolecular assembly, modifications most likely act in a concerted manner. However, it is still unclear how the information encoded in combinatorial modification patterns on the DNA and histones is translated into biological signals. My aim is to understand how combinations of DNA and histone modifications regulate the activity of chromatin. I will employ the tools of chemical biology, biochemistry and proteomics in conjunction with tissue culture models in order to identify proteins that can recognise DNA and histone modification patterns in the context of chromatin. I propose to use native chemical ligations to generate a library of histone proteins that carry combinations of modifications that are known to mark specific genomic loci. These histones will be assembled into chromatin together with methylated DNA in order to mimic functional genetic elements such as heterochromatin, promoters or enhancers. I will use the recombinantly defined chromatin in chromatin modification, chromatin remodelling and SILAC affinity purification assays in order to identify novel factors that recognise combinatorial modifications. The SILAC affinity purifications will be linked to a primary cell cancer model in order to identify factors that regulate central tumour suppressor genes. The identified factors will be further characterised in vivo, in vitro and in structural studies in order to understand their molecular function. These experiments will identify factors that can read epigenetic signatures contained in chromatin modification patterns. These constitute the primary targets for ?epigenetic drugs? that intervene at key stages in the development of cancer.	European Research Council	Starting Grant	1629630.0	EUR

Epigenetics also provides possible means to manipulate the complex interactions that occur in inflammatory disease, for example to suppress cytokine production, alter senescence behaviour, control differentiation and thereby understand and manipulate disease. Despite this progress a detailed picture and systematic understanding about which epigenetic factors are important are missing and we attempt to address this impasse in our program. Here we bring together leading academic researchers and a public-private partnership that will identify key epigenetic mechanisms in mesenchymal stem cell, bone and inflammation biology. We will systematically analyse epigenetic factors using targeted screening platforms consisting of antisense as well as unique small molecule inhibitors, animal and ex vivo model systems to understand stem cell ageing in relation to bone formation and inflammation. We propose that a more detailed understanding of the epigenetic inter-relationships within the bone environment, and the effects of ageing and the ability of mesenchymal stem cells to differentiate to osteoblasts in an inflammatory milieu will provide novel insights into disease mechanisms and identify innovative strategies for the development of unique anabolic and anti-inflammatory therapies needed in inflammatory arthritis.

Left unchecked, transposons pose a severe threat to genome integrity, thus organisms have evolved robust mechanisms in order to keep transposons in check. However, transposons are also an important source of genetic diversity, with many examples now documented of how transposon insertions lead to potentially beneficial genetic changes to organisms- indeed up to 40% of primate-specific gene regulatory elements are thought to have originated in this way. Thus the mechanisms that control transposons may themselves be regulated to ensure that they do not completely stifle transposon activity, thereby removing an important source of evolutionary novelty. We are interested in how this delicate balance is maintained, and whether it can be altered in order to facilitate adaptation of organisms to the environment. To address the question of how transposon silencing mechanisms are regulated to control the origin of evolutionary novelty we are using nematodes as a model system. Our main focus is piwi-interacting small RNAs (piRNAs), a transposon silencing pathway that is active in the germline and is conserved across metazoans. Just as in drosophila and mammal, piRNAs in the model nematode C. elegans are able to silence transposons and are important in maintaining the fertility of the animal over many generations. In addition, piRNAs are capable of establishing epigenetic changes that can be inherited for many generations independently of the presence of the initial piRNA trigger. However, we recently discovered that piRNAs are not found universally across the nematode phylum. In fact the entire piRNAs pathway is has been lost several times independently in different nematode lineages. Moreover, even in C. elegans, we showed in collaboration with Shawn Ahmed (University of North Carolina), that the loss of fertility that occurs in animals lacking the piRNA pathway can be completely suppressed by mutations compromising insulin signalling pathways. These two unusual aspects of the nematode piRNA system mean that nematodes offer a unique advantage to study what happens to genome evolution in the absence of the piRNA pathway. By using comparative genomics between different nematode species we are trying to decipher the effects of piRNAs on long-term genome evolution. Moreover, we are using in lab evolution in C. elegans to test in the short term what happens to genome evolution in the absence of the piRNA pathway. Together these two approaches will enable us to answer the fundamental questions of how transposons contribute to evolutionary novelty, and how cellular epigenetic pathways influence this process. Moreover, our work will give insight into the ways in which aberrant transposon silencing, as is known to occur in cancer, may contribute to the development of the disease.

We have clear preliminary data of an epigenetic phase variable regulatory system which has a major impact on virulence and upon the colony opacity phenotype. The mechanism of variation is based upon recombination within a restriction modification enzyme subunit gene which allows any pneumococcal population to separate into six coexisting genetically indistinguishable subpopulations. The overall aim of the project is the determination of the mechanisms of epigenetic regulation of S. pneumoniae by the phase variable type I restriction modification system SpnIII. To achieve this aim we will investigate both (i) the molecular mechanisms by which SpnIII modulates gene expression and variations of pneumococcal phenotypes, and (ii) the function of the SpnIII HsdM and HsdR enzymes and the mechanism which allows the re-assortment of the six HsdS variants. Technically we will use a series of mutant strains each expressing just one of the six possible HsdS hybrids, mine databases of target site conservation, exploit SMRT sequencing to define adenine methylation, use RNAseq to monitor gene expression and perform selective substitution of chromosomal methylation targets sites for validation. The functionality of SpnIII will be explored using gene-scan allele quantification, in vitro protein production, and modification and restriction of plasmids containing panels of synthetic SpnIII target sites. These two approaches should help to elucidate SpnIII epigenetic regulation and will allow mathematical modelling of the bistable regulatory circuit which is the basis of the pneumococcal colony opacity phenotype. The integration of biological data and modelling is expected to shed light on the significance of subpopulations in the virulence of this important human pathogen.

NDDs result in lifelong intellectual disability and behavioural alterations (anxiety, hyperactivity, social impairment, communication deficits) and have therefore extremely heavy socio-economical consequences. Neuroinflammation is one of the hallmarks shared by NDD, including Down syndrome (DS, 1:800), Fragile X syndrome (FXS, 1:6000) and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD, 1:100). Recent studies demonstrate the existence of a gut-brain axis through which the intestinal microbiota is able to modulate inflammation. The µNeuroINF project is driven by our hypothesis that the gut microbiome modulates neuroinflammation impacting metabolism and behaviour and contributing to NDD pathophysiology. By studying common effects across three mouse models of NDD: i) the Fmr1-KO mouse model of FXS, ii) the Ts65Dn trisomic mouse model of DS, and iii) the Maternal Immune Activation (MIA) ASD mouse model, we aim to unravel mechanisms by which gut microbial metabolites modulate neuroinflammation and contribute to NDD-related behavioural phenotypes. Our three specific objectives are: 1) to acquire complete metabolomic, metagenomic and metaproteomic neuroinflammatory signatures in three NDD mouse models, 2) to identify microbial metabolites modulating neuroinflammation in NDD, 3) to screen their pharmacological targets and test in vivo their effect on neuroinflammation and behaviour. Meta-"omics" will reveal microbial genes, proteins and metabolites associated with variations in brain cytokines, immune cell populations and behavioural phenotypes in NDD. Microbial metabolites will be screened for pharmacological targets such as receptors and kinases, and mechanisms will be validated in vivo to explore the modulatory role of the gut microbiome on immunity and behaviour. This will ultimately lead to ovel personalised medicine and therapeutic strategies for NDD and neuroinflammation, driven by the gut microbiome.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	348725.0	GBP

The results will inform type and timing of effective interventions to prevent the growing epidemic of metabolic disorders. We will leverage biological samples and anthropometric data available from a birth cohort in Vellore, Southern India, and extend follow-up into adulthood to answer the following questions: 1) Are growth trajectories in Indian children linked to their microbiome profiles, and do profile changes link with transitions between normal and stunted states? 2) Are enteric infections and changes in microbiota profile linked, and for how long do the profiles stay altered? 3) Do microbiota profiles and enteric infections define chronic inflammation, driving the risk of metabolic disease in later life? 4) Are changes in microbiota profile translated to metabolic alterations and do they indicate pathways for intervention? We will use archived stool samples to study the microbiome and frequency of infection with pathogens associated with malnutrition, among subjects with distinct growth trajectories. We will use plasma samples to measure markers of nutrition, inflammation, and development of cardiovascular disorders. Prospectively, we will quantify further metabolic markers and body composition parameters, familial, behavioural and life-style risk factors. In the development phase we will undertake: analysis of enteric infection data against growth trajectories in the cohort; analysis of existing infant microbiome data from a smaller cohort against inflammation and growth; review availability of host genetic control data, and the potential to include a epigenetic study in the prospectively.

These powerful tools are currently being developed and involve the CRISPR/Cas9 system with slight modifications whereby the Cas9 is inactive and fused to DNA methyltransferases or 5-methylcytosine TET oxidases. We are implementing this system in collaboration with the Jurkowski lab (Stuttgart University) to understand epigenetic processes that occur during cancer initiation. Selection of the genomic regions targeted for epimutations is based on the knowledge accumulated so far in cancer epigenetics research. Numerous promoters are hypermethylated in cancer but key is the identification of combinations of genes that have the potential to be drivers in the process of cancer initiation when no genetic mutation is required. The cell types to test these epimutations on were chosen based on the hypothesis that cancer stem cells can arise from adult stem cell compartments or through dedifferentiation/reprogramming of progenitors or differentiated cells. This is compatible with the knowledge that cancer stem cells harbour stem cell-like properties. Therefore we will start by using mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), neural stem cells (NS), mammary epithelial and myoepithelial cells. Cells harbouring the induced epimutations will be analysed for tumourigenic properties in vitro and injected in immune-compromised mice in order to measure tumour growth in vivo. Subsequently these tumours will be utilised to unravel the molecular analysis of cellular transformation. In Objective 2, we will use the embryonic stem cell model system where transition between two states (primed to ground) is accompanied by widespread DNA demethylation. The methodology involves use of shRNA libraries (whole genome and sub-libraries) to find proteins involved in the DNA demethylation pathway.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	679059.0	GBP

Objectives: 1. To build a unified graphical model that represents a broad range of important variables associated with asthma and allergic disease. 2. To use innovative computational statistical latent variable modelling methods to discover novel subtypes of childhood asthma and allergy across multiple cohorts. 3. To extend these graphical models to generate novel insights into a systems modelling framework that is able to upscale in order to integrate clinical data, immunological data, genetic data and epigenetic data. 5. To extend this unified graphical modelling framework to explore principled methods for using probabilistic latent variable models to deal with missing variables in the context where not all variables are available at every time-point. 6. To formally assess the strengths and weakness of Bayesian and Frequentist methods within a longitudinal birth cohort setting. Methods: The proposal will use data from the STELAR consortium for clinical endotype discovery and data from MAAS for extending graphical models to a systems biology framework. Current Bayesian machine learning and classical-statistical probabilistic modelling approaches will be extended to identify latent disease subtypes. Dimensionality reduction techniques will be developed and explored to understand the latent space which best describes high-dimensional clinical and immunological data - considering viral and bacterial stimuli-cytokine responses separately. Scientific and Medical Opportunities: It is hoped that more refined endotype discovery will lead to understanding their underlying biological mechanisms and therefore lead to more targeted treatment and management strategies. This is applicable not just to asthma and allergy, but is generalizable to other diseases.	Medical Research Council	Fellowship	260595.0	GBP

As the first wave of cancer genome sequencing efforts conclude, studying rare tumours has emerged as a fruitful endeavour. Rare cancers have provided remarkable insights into tumour biology, with potential to be translated into patient care. Scarcity of fresh frozen tumour material, however, has precluded the study of many types of rare tumours. As massively parallel sequencing of fixed formalin paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue is now technically feasible, sequencing rare tumours stored in p athology archives has become a tractable endeavour. I therefore propose to study rare solid childhood tumours. I intend to describe the landscape of cancer genes in 20 different tumour types (n = 200 tumours). In addition, I will define the methylome of each tumour to study whether it is a clinically useful diagnostic adjunct. A further question I propose will investigate the role of epigenetic mechanism to tumour development. In many cancers, including the bone sarcomas I studied previously, a cancer-causing (driver) variant remained elusive in some patients. A pertinent question is whether epigenetic mechanisms explain these tumours, which I will address in 25 tumours through integrative analyses of DNA, RNA, and DNA methylation sequences.

Gene transfer agents (GTAs) have been discovered in diverse prokaryotes, however, the prevalence of functional GTAs in pathogenic species is unknown. I have preliminary evidence that GTAs are present in numerous pathogens and experimental evidence of GTAs in Burkholderia. This project aims to understand the role of GTAs in the evolution of bacterial pathogens. Specifically: 1) To gain an understanding of the prevalence of GTAs in pathogenic bacteria by screening a bank of pathogenic bacteria for GTA production (e.g. Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, Neisseria, Clostridia). Discovery of a broader database of functional GTAs will allow robust identification of GTAs by bioinformatics. 2) To assess the impact of GTAs on the transfer of antibiotic and virulence genes between pathogenic bacteria using microcosms that approximate environmental and clinical conditions, and by exposing the producer bacteria to environmentally relevant stresses such as antibiotics or competitor species. 3) To understand the regulation of GTA induction using a bespoke flow cytometry cell sorting technique to separate GTA-producer cells from non-producers for analysis with transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses. 4) To determine the mechanism of random DNA packaging using in vitro and in vivo packaging assays based on established techniques from enterobacteria phage T4.

The var gene family is known to undergo epigenetic silencing and switching, involving sirtuin histone deacetylases. Var genes also recombine readily to generate new variants. However, the mechanisms underlying these virulence processes are not fully understood. G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structures may influence both transcription and recombination of var genes. G4-forming sequences are strikingly rare in the AT-rich P. falciparum genome, and are concentrated around var genes. In model systems, these structures can affect both transcription and recombination by stalling RNA or DNA polymerases. A special class of 'RecQ' helicases unwind G4s and a human RecQ helicase was recently shown to operate in concert with a sirtuin: cells lacking either of these proteins developed genome instability and chromosome fusions at G-rich telomeres. In P. falciparum, I have shown that similar phenotypes are seen in a sirtuin knockout, suggesting that G4s, RecQ helicases and sirtuins may also affect DNA metabolism in the parasite. Several complementary molecular-genetic approaches will address this hypothesis. Parasites will be treated with G4-stablizing drugs and tested for altered var gene transcription, telomere maintenance and karyotypic changes. G4 sequences will be cloned upstream of reporter genes, as integrated transgenes, and their effect on transcription and recombination will be examined. Putative RecQ helicases will be knocked out and the mutant parasites phenotyped, and ChIP studies of the helicases will be carried out in strains with or without a sirtuin. Together, these experiments will provide multiple lines of evidence for the role of G4s, RecQ helicases and sirtuins in controlling transcription and recombination of P. falciparum virulence genes, thus improving our understanding of a fundamental aspect of malaria biology.

The methodology involves fixation of DNA-bound proteins with a crosslinker (often formaldehyde), the fragmentation of chromatin into soluble particles of defined size, and the immunopurification of these particles using highly specific antibodies. Purified material can be analyzed for DNA sequence and protein content. In this R’Equip grant application we request funding for a dedicated ultrasonicator workstation for chromatin fragmentation. The apparatus utilizes ultrasonic focused acoustics and has distinct advantages over conventional laboratory sonicators. The high frequency (1 MHz) and low wavelength (1mm) prevent sample heating and denaturation. The extent of fragmentation is highly reproducible and particle size distribution is narrow. Therefore the comparison of experiments becomes more reliable than with currently available instruments.The new sonicator is expected to facilitate our studies on the transcriptional mechanisms during adipogenesis (Deplancke), the epigenetic regulation of endogenous retroviruses and mammalian homeostasis (Trono), the transcriptional rhythms that underlie the Circadian clock (Naef) and telomeric chromatin composition (Lingner).

Telomeres consist of tandem TTAGGG repeats bound to a 6-protein complex known as shelterin. More recently, telomeres have been also shown to contain long non-coding telomeric RNAs (TelRNAs or TERRAs), which are associated to the telomeric chromatin and have been proposed to be potential regulators of telomerase activity and telomere length. In addition, telomeric chromatin is enriched in epigenetic marks characteristic of constitutive heterochromatin, such as histone trimethylation (H3K9 and H4K20 tri-methylation) and DNA hypermethylation, which act as negative regulators of telomere length. Telomere length defects are associated to both cancer and aging processes, and have been recently shown to have a profound effect on stem cell behaviour. Here, we propose to determine the role of both genetic and epigenetic telomere regulators in cancer and aging by generating new mouse models. Finally, we will study the role of these factors in stem cell biology.	European Research Council	Advanced Grant	2000000.0	EUR

However, this requires development of new technology. Advancing state-of-the-art: We propose a paradigm shift in gene therapy for chronic ischemia by activating endogenous VEGF-A,-B and -C genes and angiogenic transcription programs from the native promoters instead of gene transfer of exogenous cDNA to target tissues. We will develop a new platform technology (endogenetherapy) based on our novel concept of the release of promoter pausing and new promoter-targeted upregulating short hairpinRNAs, tissue-specific superenhancerRNAs activating specific transcription centers involving gene clusters in different chromosomal regions, small circularRNAs formed from self-splicing exons-introns that can be regulated with oligonucleotides and small molecules such as metabolites, nuclear RNAi vectors and specific CRISPR/gRNAmutatedCas9-VP16 technology with an ability to target integration into genomic safe harbor sites. After preclinical studies in mice and in a newly developed chronic cardiac ischemia model in pigs with special emphasis on the analysis of clinically relevant blood flow, metabolic and functional outcomes based on MRI, ultrasound, photoacoustic and PET imaging, the best construct will be taken to a phase I clinical study in patients with severe myocardial ischemia. Since endogenetherapy also involves epigenetic changes, which are reversible and long-lasting, we expect to efficiently activate natural angiogenic programs. Significance: If successful, this approach will begin a new era in gene therapy. Since there is a clear lack of technology capable of targeted upregulation of endogenous genes, the novel endogenetherapy approach may become widely applicable beyond cardiovascular diseases also in other areas of medicine and biomedical research.

The ability to switch between diverse modes of migration enables tumors to adapt to micro-environmental conditions and to metastasize. The critical pathways and cellular processes underlying the plasticity of tumor cell motility have only begun to be identified. Endocytosis, originally thought of as a device to internalize nutrients and membrane-bound molecules, is emerging as a connectivity infrastructure (which we call ?the Endocytic Matrix?) of different cellular networks necessary for the execution of various cellular programs. A primary role of the Endocytic Matrix is the delivery of space- and time-resolved signals to the cell, and it is thus essential for the execution of polarized functions during cell migration. The molecular mechanisms it uses are, however, ill defined and likely to involve, in addition to extranuclear pathways, also transcriptional programs. In this respect, we have acquired evidence that components of the Endocytic Matrix require de novo gene expression to promote the transition in the mode of tumor cell motility. We propose to identify critical components of the Endocytic Matrix that by controlling the cellular location of actin remodellers promote the plasticity of tumor cell migration. We will also test whether, in addition to the immediate epigenetic/signalling-based control of migration, the Endocytic Matrix regulates transcriptional programs required for the acquisition or maintenance of diverse modes of motility. Finally, in view of the key role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in cancer, we will use miRNA profiling, together with endocytic cell migration and invasion assays in human cancer cells to test whether miRNAs mediate the relationship between endocytosis and motility programs	European Research Council	Advanced Grant	2232200.0	EUR

Even more recently, it has been recognized that microRNAs, small non-coding RNAs that are thought to regulate gene expression by sequence-specific base pairing in mRNA targets, also play a key role in the biology of the cell, and that they can also have an impact in the development of many diseases, including cancer (le Sage and Agami, 2006; Blenkiron and Miska, 2007). However, there is little understanding about epigenetic modifications that might regulate the activity of microRNAs and other non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs), transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs), small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), long interspersed ncRNAs (lincRNAs), promoter-associated RNAs (PASRs and PALRs) and terminator-associated sRNAs (TASRs) (Calin et al., 2007; Mercer, et al., 2009; Ghildiyal & Zamore, 2009; Jacquier, 2009). Our ignorance in this respect is even more significant if we consider these questions in the domain of cancer. Making best use of our expertise in several of these fields, my group will tackle the study of the epigenetic modifications that regulate ncRNA expression and how the DNA methylation and histone modifications profiles of these loci might become distorted in human cancer. These findings could have profound consequences not only in the understading of tumor biology, but in the design of better molecular staging, diagnosis and treatments of human malignancies.

Organ initiation requires tightly controlled cell division patterning and cell fate reprogramming. Auxin, a key plant hormone, plays a crucial role in these processes, ultimately through significantly altering the gene expression landscape. On the other hand, gene expression can also be defined by manipulating locus accessibility, both on protein- (i.e. nucleosomes, histones and their modifications) as well as on DNA level: methylation status of cytosines in coding genes, mainly in their promoter regions, severely affects their expression rate and regulation. The interplay between auxin signaling and DNA methylation is poorly understood and we are planning to address this question in our research. We will characterize “freak show” (fks), a novel missense mutant of NRPE5, a subunit of RNA Polymerase V (Pol V) involved in RNA-directed DNA Methylation (RdDM). We isolated fks in a forward genetic screen aimed at identifying auxin-dependent determinants of lateral root development. fks is absolutely unique among all known Pol V mutants as it shows a series of very strong phenotypic traits in its inbred progenies such as organogenesis defects, dwarfism, sterility, homeotic organ transformations or delayed flowering time. Several of these features had already been described as potentially caused by epialleles, i.e. alterations of DNA methylation at target loci. However, to our knowledge, this is the first example that a mutant in de novo DNA methylation displays such a diverse palette of epigenetic features. Characterization of fks will help us, besides gaining new knowledge about auxin action, to understand how Pol V functions and how RdDM can be directed or regulated on a general level, with insight into developmental and physiological processes regulated by this machinery. We will use next generation sequencing (NGS) for determining the transcriptome and methylome of fks. To couple auxin-dependent gene expression and DNA methylation, we will combine auxin treatment with the NGS analysis. Besides, we will identify epialleles causing aberrant lateral root development and other selected traits with physical mapping, when and where feasible. We will perform double mutant analyses to investigate genetically whether the fks mutation specifically affects any of the known RdDM sub-pathways and whether it interferes with DNA methylation maintenance too. We will obtain triple mutants of NRPE5 and its two homologs of unknown function to further elaborate their role in RdDM and development. Additionally, we will address the function of NRPE5 and its homologs biochemically: protein interaction assays with other RNA polymerase subunits will tell us about possible subunit composition and –affinity of Pol V. The proposed research will be conducted at IST Austria, led by Jirí Friml.	Austrian Science Fund FWF	Stand-Alone Project	351799.89	EUR

Intelligence and memory are usually associated with plastic neuronal connections in higher organisms. However, new discoveries hint that a rudimentary form of intelligence is rooted in networks that regulate gene expression in a wide range of organisms, including bacteria and yeasts. Specifically, we and others have shown that microbes show plastic behavioral responses to past experiences, such as previously available nutrients or stresses. This implies that information about the past is somehow retained and passed to next generations, where it influences cellular regulation. The goal of this project is to use a simple eukaryotic regulatory circuit as a model to obtain a comprehensive picture of the different genes and molecular mechanisms underlying history-dependence (hysteresis) in cellular regulation. Specifically, we will study maltose (MAL) regulation in budding yeast, because this signaling pathway serves as a model for gene regulation circuits in other organisms, including humans. We will use a combination of genetic screens, live-cell microscopy in custom-built microfluidic devices, and mathematical modeling to pursue four aims: 1. To provide a comprehensive quantitative analysis of hysteresis in MAL regulation 2. To unravel the molecular mechanisms contributing to hysteresis 3. To unravel the epigenetic mechanisms allowing hysteresis to extend over several generations 4. To characterize the ecological relevance of hysteresis This project will establish an innovative model for hysteresis and generate a genome-wide, systems-level view of how past influences can be stored in regulatory cascades to influence cellular decision-making. The results will contribute to a paradigm shift in our view of biological regulation and memory, with possible applications in fields as diverse as industrial microbiology, synthetic biology and medicine.

What we lack is an understanding of the underlying genetic mechanism and with it, the best model to explain the processes at work. Here we focus on discovering the genetic mechanisms underlying the host-parasite interactions because this knowledge will allow us to identify the model to best explain coevolution. The two most often discussed models are time lacked negative frequency dependent selection (the Red Queen hypothesis) and coevolution by selective sweeps. Knowing the genetics would allow us to pinpoint the appropriate coevolutionary model.The Pasteuria-Daphnia modelPasteruia ramosa is an endoparasitic bacterium infecting several Daphnia species as well as some other Cladocera. Despite of Pasteuria's seemingly low degree of specificity on the host species level, this bacterium shows a remarkable degree of host genotype specificity. The same clone of Pasteuria shows high specificity in infection for only certain clones of D. magna, but is also specific to certain clones of other species, e.g. D. longispina or D. pulex. I am proposing that one Ph.D. student project continues to work on the genetic interactions between Daphnia and parasite clones. The aims of this work would be 1) Conduct multiple crosses between Daphnia clones and elucidate the segregation patterns of resistance. 2) Test for linkage among resistance loci. 3) To determine whether resistance loci show epistasis, i.e., if combinations of alleles result in different phenotypes than their effects alone would suggest. The postdoc project proposed here focuses on the population genetic structure of Pasteuria ramosa. For this we plan to sample Pasteuria from different spatial and temporal scales and obtain sequence data on putative resistance loci and house-keeping genes. This project has three parts: 1) Global scale: With Pasteuria samples across Europe and North America. 2) Intermediate temporal scale: Using Pasteuria samples from the layered sediments of lakes (sediment cores), we plan to reconstruct the temporal changes of the Pasteuria populations over periods of about 30 years. 3) Short temporal scale: To link the changes in allele frequencies expected from the sediment cores with events during natural selection, we will collect time series of Pasteuria-infected Daphnia during epidemics in natural populations. These data will allow us to follow the microevolutionary changes during coevolution and to quantify the strength of selection acting on candidate genes. The Octosporea-Daphnia modelOctosporea bayeri is a microsporidian parasite with both vertical and horizontal transmission. Preliminary data suggest, that O. bayeri adapts by means of epigenetic genome modification. The second Ph.D. project for which I seek funding with this proposal is to verify or reject the epigenetics hypothesis for O. bayeri. First we will carry out detailed experiments to test for epigenetic adaptation. If these experiments suggest that epigenetic effects are likely to play a role for parasite adaptation, we will use 'bisulfite sequencing' to obtain methylation patterns of O. bayeri kept in different host environments. This would allow us to find candidate genes responsible for parasite adaptation to its host clones. The topic of parasite adaptation by means of epigenetics has received little attention by evolutionary biologists, but promises an exciting field for understanding host-parasite coevolution.

This notion is one of the basic tenants of systems science. In systems biology/medicine complex (disease) phenotypes arise from multiple interacting factors, specifically proteins. Yet, the biochemical and mechanistic base of complex phenotypes remain elusive. An array of powerful genomic technologies including GWAS, WGS, transcriptomics, epigenetic analyses and proteomics have identified numerous factors that contribute to complex phenotypes. It can be expected that over the next few years, genetic factors contributing to specific complex phenotypes will be comprehensively identified, while their interactions will remain elusive. The project "Proteomics 4D: The proteome in context "explores the concept, that complex phenotypes arise from the perturbation of modules of interacting proteins and that these modules integrate seemingly independent genomic variants into a single biochemical response. We will develop and apply a generic technology to directly measure the composition, topology and structure of wild type and genetically perturbed protein modules and relate structural changes to their functional output. This will be achieved by a the integration of quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic technologies determining molecular phenotypes, and hybrid structural methods consisting of chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry, cryoEM and computational data integration to probe structural perturbations. The project will focus initially on the structural and functional effects of cancer associated mutations in protein kinase modules and then generalize to study perturbed modules in any tissue and disease state. The resources supporting this technology will be disseminated to catalyze a broad transformation of biology and molecular medicine towards the analysis of the proteome as a modular entity, the proteome in context.

796	Prof. Amos TANAY	WEIZMANN INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE	None	2012-12-01	2017-12-01	Evolutionary mechanisms of epigenomic and chromosomal aberrations in cancer	Our working hypothesis is that tumorigenesis is an evolutionary process that fundamentally couples few major driving events (point mutations, rearrangements) with a complex flux of minor aberrations, many of which are epigenetic. We believe that these minor events are critical factors in the emergence of the cancer phenotype, and that understanding them is essential to the characterization of the disease. In particular, we hypothesize that a quantitative and principled evolutionary model for carcinogenesis is imperative for understanding the heterogeneity within tumor cell populations and predicting the effects of cancer therapies. We will therefore develop an interdisciplinary scheme that combines theoretical models of cancer evolution with in vitro evolutionary experiments and new methods for assaying the population heterogeneity of epigenomic organization. By developing techniques to interrogate DNA methylation and its interaction with other key epigenetic marks at the single-cell level, we will allow quantitative theoretical predictions to be scrutinized and refined. By combining models describing epigenetic aberrations with direct measurements of chromatin organization using Hi-C and 4C-seq, we shall revisit fundamental questions on the causative nature of epigenetic changes during carcinogenesis. Ultimately, we will apply both theoretical and experimental methodologies to assay and characterize the evolutionary histories of tumor cell populations from multiple mouse models and clinical patient samples.

Our aim is to understand how nuclear organization and chromatin dynamics impact on gene transcription and genome stability.To understand these fundamental processes, we are using yeast as a model system allowing to couple genetics and advanced live microscopy. In budding yeasts, repressed telomeric chromatin is found near the nuclear envelope in discrete foci in which telomeres cluster and silencing factors concentrate. On the other hand, others, and we recently reported that gene activation occur at the nuclear periphery, apparently requiring association with nuclear pore complexes. Thus, repressive and activating domains appear to both be positioned at the periphery of the nucleus.In order to understand the mechanisms underlying this nuclear sub-compartmentalization, we will address three complementary issues:-What are the mechanisms involved in the establishment and maintenance of silent compartments?-How and why are some activated genes recruited to the nuclear periphery?-What are the relationships between repressive and activating compartments?A final subject we wish to address concerns the impact of nuclear organization on common fragile sites which are large chromosomal regions that preferentially exhibit gaps or breaks after DNA synthesis is partially perturbed. This project will be done in collaboration with Jennifer Cobb (University of Calgary). We hope to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the formation of nuclear subcompartments and their importance for genome functions. These mechanisms are likely to be conserved and will be subsequently tested in higher eukaryotic cells.	European Research Council	Starting Grant	1000000.0	EUR

Gadd45a is activated by the tumor suppressor gene p53, which is mutated in >50% of human tumors. We found that Gadd45a is a negative regulator of T cell proliferation, and that lack of Gadd45a in mice leads to development of an autoimmune disease similar to systemic lupus erythematosus. The molecular mechanisms that cause autoimmunity are still poorly understood. T cells from Gadd45a-null mice show constitutive p38 activation and hyperproliferative responses, resulting in autoimmunity. Recent evidence suggests that activation of p38 signaling is involved in autoimmune development and tumor suppression. Gadd45a negatively regulates p38 activity in T cells by preventing phosphorylation on Tyr323. Inhibition of Tyr323p38 phosphorylation is a potential therapeutic target in several types of leukemia and autoimmune diseases, including lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. The main goals of this project are a) to study the in vivo function of the Gadd45 family and p38 in tumor suppression and autoimmunity, and b) to analyze their molecular mechanisms to identify targets for disease treatment. We will dissect the signaling pathways involved in development of autoimmunity and cancer using a multidisciplinary approach that combines mouse genetic, human epigenetic, biochemical, molecular biological and immunological techniques. Our project involves the generation of murine models deficient in each member of the Gadd45 family (Gadd45a, Gadd45b, Gadd45g), as well as double- and triple-knockout mice, development of a knock-in model for p38a, in vivo and in vitro analysis of T cell activation, proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation, epigenetic studies of potential targets, and finally, validation of these results in autoimmune disease and cancer patients. The results of this project will help identify new therapeutic targets for autoimmune diseases and/or cancer.	European Research Council	Starting Grant	1755805.0	EUR
799	Professor Friedman	The Hebrew University Of Jerusalem	None	2014-01-01	2019-01-01	Systematic Approach to Dissect the Interplay between Chromatin and Transcription	Epigenetic mechanisms play an important role in regulating and maintaining the functionality of cells and have been implicated in a wide range of human diseases. Histone proteins that form the protein core of nucleosomes are subject to a bewildering array of covalent and structural modifications, which can repress, permit, or promote transcription. These modifications can be added and removed by specialized complexes that are recruited by other covalent modifications, by transcription factors, or by the transcriptional machinery. Advances in genomics led to comprehensive mapping of the ''epigenome'' in a range of tissues and organisms. These maps established the tight connection between histone modifications and transcription programs. These static charts, however, are less successful at uncovering the underlying mechanisms, logic, and function of histone modifications in establishing and maintaining transcriptional programs. Our premise is that we can answer these basic questions by observing the effect of genetic perturbations on the dynamics of both chromatin state and transcriptional activity. We aim to dissect the chromatin-transcription system in a systematic manner by building on our extensive experience in modeling and analysis, and a unique high-throughput experimental system we established in my lab. We plan to use the budding yeast model organism, which allows for efficient genetic and experimental manipulations. We will combine two technologies: (1) high-throughput measurements of single-cell transcriptional output using fluorescence reporters; and (2) high-throughput immunoprecipitation sequencing assays to map chromatin state. Measuring with these the dynamics of response to stimuli under different genetic backgrounds and using advanced stochastic network models, we will chart detailed mechanisms that are opaque to current approaches and elucidate the general principles that govern the interplay between chromatin and transcription.

Changes in CIZ1 are similarly emerging as widespread early events in cellular transformation, again implicating both oncogenic and tumour suppressor activity. Our analysis of CIZ1 null murine somatic cells at early passage (before immortalization) revealed widespread deregulation of genes that are normally under the control of PRC2, including those located on the inactive X chromosome (Xi). However PRC2 subunit levels are not themselves changed. This project will investigate how CIZ1 determines PRC target gene selection, and build on our recent evidence which suggests that PRC2 is normally attached to the core nuclear matrix, and that CIZ1 supports transfer of repressed chromatin toward the interior of the nucleus (likely visiting PRC2 bodies) specifically during S phase. We will use early passage WT cells because our data show that immortalized cells and tumour-derived cells have already sustained changes in PRC2 (release from the nuclear matrix) that facilitate bypass of the process we wish to study. We will use the Xi as a model to study template transfer (TT) because we can follow its movement, during DNA replication, from its typical position at the nuclear periphery into the interior and back again within a 30 minute window. Thus, this project will address i) the contribution of spatial immobilization of PRC bodies and associated TT to fidelity of PRC target gene maintenance in primary somatic cells and ii) whether the process is bypassed by reversion to a less spatially restricted, embryonic-like, process in transformed cells, and iii) the extent to which our common cultured cell models fail to report on what appears to be an unstudied mechanism that helps to maintain epigenetic fidelity in the body.

A major challenge in stem cell biology is investigating these cells in their natural state in vivo, and obtaining highly pure and sufficient quantities for characterisation. Skeletal myogenesis provides an excellent paradigm to investigate stem cell function and regenerative biology because of its accessibility, and its striking ability to regenerate efficiently. Futhermore, the same individual can undergo multiple rounds of muscle injury thereby permitting the long term study of stem cell turnover and homeostasis after inflicted trauma without life threatening consequences or complex surgical procedures.The objective of this research programme is to identify mouse stem cell properties and understand how they regulate cell fate choice in different contexts by modulating their modes of cell divisions. Specifically, biased DNA segregation, which has been reported in diverse organisms from bacteria to vertebrates and is thus an evolutionary ancient phenomenon, will be investigated. Notably, we developed genetic tools that allow us to isolate prospectively those cells that execute asymmetric vs. symmetric cell divisions during regeneration, and directly linked cell fates with biased DNA segregation. The use of innovative nucleotides, micropatterns to mimic the niche, epigenetic, genetic and single cell transcriptomics strategies comprise a multi-pronged strategy to uncover the underlying mechanisms that govern asymmetric cell fates and biased DNA segregation. This knowledge will be projected to tissuegenesis using complementary clonal lineage tracing and live imaging of cell divisions in vivo. These studies aim to identify the diverse modes of stem cell divisions during tissuegenesis, information that can significantly impact on regenerative medicine.

Advances in targeted hormonal therapy (second generation anti-androgens) have led to more effective management of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Despite these highly potent drugs, disease recurs with new genomic and epigenetic alterations. In this ERC proposal, I will leverage my expertise in cancer genomics and a new computational methodology to unravel the landscape of lethal PCA, with a focus on determining the Achilles' heel of these aggressive tumours. In Aim 1, I will take advantage of DNA sequencing data from over 1000 patient-derived tumour samples and use highly innovative mathematical algorithms to create a detailed evolution chart for each tumour and identify driver events leading to CRPC. After nominating candidate drivers, we propose testing 10 using in vitro gain- and loss-of-function validations experiments (i. e. , CRISPR/Cas9, shRNA, and Tet-On assays) in PCA cell lines using migration, invasion, and cell cycle as readouts. In Aim 2, I will focus on genomic events that occur in recalcitrant CRPC, positing that genetic alterations occurring prior or secondary to treatment harbour clues into resistance. In vitro validations will be performed on the top 10 biomarkers. In Aim 3, I will nominate synthetic lethality combinations by mining CRPC genomic data taken from Stand Up 2 Cancer CRPC clinical trials. I will prioritize mutually exclusive genomic alterations in genes for which approved drugs exist. The top 5-10 candidates will be validated in a prostate lineage-specific manner. In summary, this ERC proposal will leverage my many years of expertise in PCA genomics and emerging public and private CRPC datasets to uncover driver mutations that will enhance our understanding of recalcitrant CRPC. Successful completion of this study should lead to novel treatment approaches for CRPC and to a computational model that may transform our approach to evaluating other cancers.

Environmental conditions, regenerative capacity and tissue architecture are likely to play important roles in this. In addition, organ-specific adult stem cells are the most likely cellular targets for successive accumulation of cancer-initiating oncogenic mutations. Our recent data indeed shows that mutations accumulate over time in adult stem cells from both liver and intestine. However, mutation frequencies, spectra and genomic distribution differ markedly between tissues and may thus contribute to organ-specific variation in cancer incidence. <strong>Here, I propose to follow up on these observations by systematic genome-wide characterization of somatic mutations in adult stem cells from a broad range of tissues within aged individuals. </strong>Organ-specific mutational and DNA repair processes leave characteristic footprints in the genome, which can only be properly characterized by whole genome sequencing. I have developed a unique approach for systematic identification of mutation patterns in individual human adult stem cells based on whole genome sequencing of clonally-derived organoid cultures. Computational analyses allow for the identification of mutational processes that may be linked to variation in organ-specific cancer incidence. Using this approach, I will generate and characterize a unique resource of clonal organoid cultures from organs that show high variability in cancer incidence, such as small intestine, pancreas and colon, derived from post-mortem tissue samples of individual donors. This will allow direct comparison of organ-specific mutation load within individuals and construction of a human somatic mutation bodymap. Finally, I will also generate transcriptional and epigenetic data for studying potential links with tissue-specific biological processes. This research is expected to result in fundamental insight into organ-specific mutational processes in relation to tumor initiation, which may ultimately benefit cancer prevention.</p>	Worldwide Cancer Research	Project Grant	242339.0	GBP

First, we have worked for the past 15 years on understanding the biological functions of non-coding RNAs and the mechanisms by which these RNAs act. Most recently, we have worked extensively on a small RNA based innate immune system, the piRNA pathway, and its role in protecting germline integrity in animals. Secondly, we attempt to tackle critical problems in cancer biology, with a major focus on breast and pancreatic cancer. We use mouse models, human tissues, and innovative approaches to understand aspects of disease ranging from the genetics of early, non-invasive cancers to critical pathways driving metastasis. We also work to understand the roles of long non-coding RNAs in normal development and how their functions might be disrupted in cancer. Building from our observations that small RNAs direct DNA methylation during germ cell development in animals, we have developed a broader interest in epigenetic regulation, both in normal cell and in cancer. Finally, have a long history of technological innovation, having developed approaches such as short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) and exome capture. Current technology development is occurring in several areas including mining information inherent in tumor heterogeneity, optimization of crispr-based strategies, and building general platforms for control of biological processes by light.

Identifying genes that are responsible for the development of TNBC is essential for the development of effective targeted therapies. We recently reported the finding of one such gene, called BCL11A . We analysed cancer genomics datasets and found that the transcription factor BCL11A was overexpressed in the majority of TNBC. Functional characterisation of BCL11A found it to be important for tumour initiation and maintenance. Over the past 2 years my lab has studied the BCL11A interactome in TNBC and B-cells and identified CHD8 as a TNBC-specific interacting partner for BCL11A. Aims In this project we aim to address three questions: 1) What are the epigenetic and transcriptomic consequences of the BCL11A-CHD8 interaction? 2) Which protein domains are important and responsible for the BCL11A-CHD8 interaction? 3) What is the function of the downstream target of BCL11A-CHD8, USP17L in TNBC? Techniques and Methodology To address these questions we will: 1) perform genome wide ATACseq, Chipseq and RNAseq analysis to identify the epigenetic and transcriptomic changes in the absence and presence of BCL11A and CHD8; 2) perform Co-IP and biophysical assays to identify and confirm the domains responsible for direct BCL11A and CHD8 interactions; and, 3) perform a loss of function and gain of function experiments to characterise the role of the USP17L family of deubiquitinating enzymes in TNBC. Impact on breast cancer research This grant would fund a project that will study how BCL11A interacts with other proteins specifically found in TNBC. Finding the means of disrupting those interactions could be used for the treatment of TNBC. Therefore, results of this project will form important foundations for deciding how to develop drugs that will specifically treat TNBC in the future.	Breast Cancer Now	Project	None	None

Parkinson's disease (PD), PD dementia (PDD) and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are Lewy body (LB) diseases, which are characterised by the cytoplasmic accumulation of a-synuclein in neurons, forming Lewy bodies (LBs). At present we do not know what molecular changes may be driving disease onset and progression and there are currently no disease-modifying treatments for these diseases. This study will represent the first systematic, epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of DNA methylation across multiple diseases characterised by synucleinopathy. We propose to analyse DNA methylation patterns using the Illumina EPIC array in 100 PD, 100 PDD, 100 DLB and 100 control donors in the substantia nigra (SN) as this is affected in the middle stages of disease, and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) as this is affected in the later stages of disease. We will identify DNA methylation signatures that can stratify individuals based on their diagnosis, genotype, pathology, symptoms and, in the case of PD, the presence of PDD. We will validate these patterns, and determine their cellular specificity using pyrosequencing and qRT-PCR on nucleic acid extracted from neurons and glia isolated from SN and PFC samples using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Loci that appear to be neuronal we will investigate further using laser capture microdissection (LCM) in PFC samples. We will collect LB-bearing neurons and neurons free of pathology and use pyrosequencing to determine which loci are specifically altered in LB-bearing neurons. These loci will be the focus of our functional characterisation experiments, where we propose to use CRISPR/Cas9 technology to alter DNA methylation at these loci, and establish the downstream consequence on cell phenotype. Taken together, we will be able to identify differentially methylated loci that are causal in LB disease pathology, which could ultimately deliver new pharmacological targets, potentially improving the lives of sufferers.

In our preliminary fMRI study, involving a small group of high risk alcohol naïve subjects, we found that a cingulo-fronto-parietal brain network underlying cognitive interference processing [error detection and resolution mediated by Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC)] was defective. In this research project, we will further characterize this endophenotype in 30 subjects at High Risk and compare it with 30 subjects at Low Risk by multimodal imaging (fMRI & fMRS) and followed by preliminary genetic analysis to study if this deficits is due to variations in few key dopaminergic and glutamatergic genes that are thought to be involved in cognitive control and learning or the epigenetic changes in these systems following early life environmental stress.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive histological subtype characterized by poor clinical outcome and a shortage of targeted treatment options. The hypoxia is considered as a major hallmark of TNBC, and it offers an environment which promotes selection of more aggressive and chemoresistant cells by altering the gene expression program. The alternative splicing generates transcriptome diversity and may contribute to hypoxia-induced gene expression program in TNBC. The interplay between hypoxia and alternative splicing in TNBC in largely unexplored area and needs further investigation. As epigenetics plays a crucial role in cellular response to hypoxia and alternative splicing is also regulated by epigenetic changes, it is possible that hypoxia-induced pathway regulates alternative splicing due to epigenetic modifications. We will utilize TNBC cell lines, clinical samples as well as cell line model of step-wise transformation to investigate how hypoxia-induced epigenetic changes modulate alternative splicing in TNBC. The overall aim of this proposal is to understand the hypoxia-mediated regulation of alternative pre-mRNA splicing which may contribute to tumorigenesis and chemoresistance bolstered by hypoxia in TNBC. It will help us to understand how certain individuals are more resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs than others and how hypoxia-associated alternative splicing contributes to tumorigenesis in TNBC.

However, while it has been shown that the genetic background of the donor individual has an effect on molecular phenotypes measured from iPSCs, it is currently not known how much the genetic background influences studies that use iPSCs to model rare disease mutations, making interpretation of results challenging. In this project, I will use CRISPR-Cas9 technology to study specific rare disease mutations in different genetic backgrounds. Specifically, I will focus on loss-of-function mutations causing Kabuki syndrome, a disorder of the epigenetic machinery, and use patient-derived iPSCs together with engineered mutant and control lines to quantify the contribution of the genetic background on the transcriptome and epigenome of the iPSCs as well as neuronal precursor cells derived from them. This project will establish the value of using patient-derived iPSCs over generic iPSC lines with engineered mutations. This information is critical for the design of any subsequent studies in which iPSCs serve as the baseline, such as directed differentiation experiments and therapeutic targeting of the mutation.

Whether chemically induced pluripotent stem cells (ciPSCs) can be generated from human somatic cells remains unknown. One of the key factors that facilitate ciPSC generation is the inhibition of histone H3 K79 methyltransferase Dot1L, which the applicant had previously shown to increase reprogramming efficiency and substitute for two of the exogenous factors used in reprogramming. To uncover chromatin-related pathways that work in parallel with Dot1L in suppressing reprogramming, we (the applicant and the UK-based Coapplicant) carried out a pilot screen of small molecule inhibitors of chromatin modifiers on human fibroblasts in combination with Dot1L inhibition. Through this screen, we identified two independent acetyl-lysine competitive inhibitors targeting the bromodomains of co-activators P300 and CBP as potent enhancers of reprogramming. Inhibition of p300/CBP bromodomain-mediated interactions has the most effect during early stages of reprogramming and significantly accelerates the emergence of iPSCs. Using functional assays and genomics-based approaches, the first aim of this project will be to understand the mechanism by which inhibition of p300/CBP facilitates reprogramming. In the second aim, we will perform a large-scale screen with additional novel probes for epigenetic modifiers to identify novel compounds that will enable the generation of ciPSCs from human somatic cells.

They can inactivate genes, provide novel coding functions, sprinkle chromosomes with recombination-prone repetitive sequences, and modulate cellular gene expression through a wide variety of transcriptional and posttranscriptional influences. As a consequence, TEs are considered as essential motors of evolution yet they are occasionally associated with disease, causing about one hundred Mendelian disorders and possibly contributing to several human cancers. As expected for such genomic threats, TEs are subjected to tight epigenetic control imposed from the very first days of embryogenesis, in part owing to their recognition by sequence-specific RNA- and protein-based repressors. It is generally considered that the evolutionary selection of these TE controllers reflects a simple host-pathogen arms race, and that their action results in the early and permanent silencing of their targets. We have recently uncovered new evolutionary evidence and obtained genomic and functional data that invalidate this dual assumption, and suggest instead that transposable elements and their epigenetic controllers establish species-specific transcriptional networks that play critical roles in human development and physiology. The general objective of the present proposal is to explore the breadth of this phenomenon, to decipher its mechanisms, to unveil its functional implications, and to probe how this knowledge could be exploited for basic research, biotechnology and clinical medicine.

Using the developing mouse cortex as a model system, the goal of my project is to examine how is the fate potential of neural progenitors cells restricted in time to generate the rich diversity of neuronal subtypes in the mammalian brain. My hypothesis is that epigenetic modifications brought about by the interaction of lineage specific long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) with ubiquitous chromatin modifying complexes, underlie the generation of different neuronal subtypes. In order to address these goals, first, I will examine genomic loci, which undergo chromatin remodeling during the progressive specification of neural progenitors. Then, I will identify lncRNAs, which recruit chromatin modifying factors to remodel these loci. Finally, I will investigate the biological function of selected candidate in guiding subtype-specific differentiation in vivo and focus on changes in the epigenome which occur upon loss of function. Overall, the work will allow us for the first time to begin to understand how epigenetic changes regulate the acquisition and maintenance of neuron subtype specific identity and provide novel insights on the contribution of lncRNA to the development of the central nervous system.

815	Professor Anthony Barrett	Imperial College London	None	2007-10-01	2010-12-31	Medicinal Chemistry Studentship: Development and synthesis of novel SIRT-inhibitors	The NAD-dependent protein deacetylase Sir2 proteins are conserved from worms to flies to humans, and they are able to deacetylate numerous proteins in addition to histones, including histones, acetyl-CoA synthetase, _-tubulin, myoD, p53, FOXO, Ku70, and NF-_B.i In addition, Sir2 has also been demonstrated to be able extend the lifespan of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans through targeting the nematode FOXO transcription factor daf-16. Sirt1 is a mammalian homologue of Sir2, and it deacetylates FOXO and blocks FOXO-induced apoptosis. Prof Lam's laboratory has found that FOXO3a serves as an important sensor for cellular stresses, in particular those induced by cytotoxic agents such as anti-cancer drugs. SIRT1 appears to control the cellular response to stress by regulating the activity of the FOXO transcription factors. It is predicted that inhibition of SIRTs will channel FOXOs from genes important for longevity and drug resistance to target genes important for apoptosis. Further, recent data from Prof. Lam's laboratory show that SIRTs could have a role in chemotherapy resistance through modulating FOXO and p53 activity. SIRT1 is predicted to have a key general role in epigenetic regulation, since inhibition of SIRT1 by pharmacologic, dominant negative, and siRNA (small interfering RNA) in breast and colon cancer cells causes increased H4-K16 and H3-K9 acetylation at endogenous promoters and gene re-expression despite full retention of promoter DNA hypermethylation. The aim of this project lies in the development novel potent and selective inhibitors for the SIRT enzyme using iterative Computer Aided Drug Design (CADD). The biological activity of those compounds will be evaluated in biochemical assays at IC London. Furthermore it is a goal to strengthen the existing fruitful collaboration between the participating groups in the Departments of Medicine and Chemistry at IC London and our partners at Emory University in Atlanta, GA.

Epigenetic regulation is a key mechanism of drug resistance, but the role of epigenetic modifications in resistance to HER2-directed therapy is currently unknown. Recent studies show that microRNAs, in addition to genes, are also subject to epigenetic regulation.

The aim of this pilot project is to perform preliminary validation of this novel panel of miRNAs as potential determinants of resistance to HER2-directed therapy. These results should enable us to select candidate miRNAs for detailed translational and functional validation as part of a subsequent project grant application.	Breast Cancer Now	Pilot	20000.0	GBP
818	Professor Albert Tenesa	University of Edinburgh	None	2011-10-01	2015-05-31	Statistical and computational methods for population stratification and prediction of cancer risk	Background Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have allowed an unprecedented advance in the understanding of several cancers by identifying numerous loci contributing to their phenotypic variation. Because GWAS apply stringent thresholds of statistical significance, the few loci that reach these thresholds explain only a small proportion of the phenotypic variation and have poor overall predictive value. Increasing the number of loci included in the prediction models would increase their predictive value and allow capitalising on the full potential of genetics to inform clinical practice and public health policy. Genomic prediction (GP) encompasses the use of large numbers of one or more types of genomic data (e.g. sequence and copy number variants or epigenetic changes) in statistical models of risk prediction. GP is important because genetic variation explains a large proportion of the phenotypic variance in most cancers and allows prediction beyond family history. Genetic information is available at birth, accurate and has the potential to make a significant contribution to preventing and understanding cancer. Aims & Objectives The main purpose is to develop methods that allow effective use of genome-wide genomic information for the prediction of cancer risk, i.e. for GP of cancer, and to use colorectal cancer as a paradigm. The objectives are to: 1.Develop and compare GP methods using simulated data. 2.Apply the best performing method from 1. to colorectal cancer incidence and survival data. 3.Develop high-performance computing algorithms for GP. Methods The risk prediction accuracy currently achieved by using loci identified through GWAS can be improved by including all (or a larger proportion of) loci contributing to the trait’s variation in the prediction model. We will use mixed linear models, Bayesian hierarchical models and penalised regression methods for GP. These methods can yield better and more robust estimates of risk by omitting significance testing and simultaneously estimating the effects of all loci contributing to the trait. How the results of this research will be used GP on its own or combined with risk factors such as family history, age and gender, could be used to stratify the population into risk groups. Risk stratification could be used to tailor the intensity or frequency of screening to the level of risk, with the ultimate aim of reducing cancer incidence and mortality.

Transcription factors (TFs) play a pivotal role in transcriptional regulation by binding DNA at specific sites. Past genome-wide analyses have largely ignored the strength of the TF binding sites or focused primarily on high-occupancy binding sites. However, low-occupancy binding sites do exist and I propose characterizing their function genome-wide. Preliminary analysis based on publicly available binding data of the vertebrate CTCF TF suggests cell-type specific regulatory functions for these sites. I hypothesize that the dynamic interplay between weakly bound TFs and nucleosomes is crucial for providing rapid transcriptional responses to the cell in the event of an environmental stimulus. I intend to make use of already mapped CTCF binding sites across cell-types and propose to map them using ChIP-Seq in two cell-types: resting and activated CD4 T cells. Additionally, I plan to characterize the genomic, phylogenetic, and epigenetic information at high- and low-occupancy CTCF site s. Epigenetic data such as histone modifications and DNA methylation are available in some cell-types; it will be profiled in others using ChIP-Seq. My final goal is to build a computational model that will predict the regulatory role of low-occupancy site(s) based on various above-mentioned genomic and epigenetic features.

In rodents, the pluripotent epiblast gives rise to a cup-shaped epithelium, the egg-cylinder. However, primate development diverges from the rodent paradigm: The primate epiblast forms a flat disc and segregates an extraembryonic lineage after implantation, the amnion. The very recent discovery that primates specify germ cells from nascent amnion highlights the fundamental importance of this enigmatic lineage decision. Here, I propose to open the black box of amnion formation by transcriptional and epigenetic profiling of marmoset embryos. The use of a non-human primate is absolutely essential, because human postimplantation embryos are not available at the relevant stages. Building on strong collaborations with primate centres in Germany and Japan, I will perform laser-capture-microdissection combined with state-of-the-art single-cell profiling at early postimplantation stages. Based on these insights, I will generate synthetic marmoset embryos and develop an in vitro model for implantation. Key advantages of synthetic marmoset embryos include access to in vivo controls and sufficient numbers for comprehensive functional analysis of amnion formation. This research presents a unique opportunity to transform our understanding of placental development, germ cell specification and the continuum of pluripotent states in human and nonhuman primate embryogenesis.

Using single-cell RNA-sequencing we will examine the gene expression programmes induced in macroglia and pericytes at distinct time points along the reprogramming trajectory following expression of transcription factors, epigenetic regulators, and microRNAs known to regulate interneuron specification during cortical development. Induced gene expression programmes will be compared to those of endogenous interneurons. Factor combinations that allow for conversion into neurons that closely resemble endogenous interneurons will be used for lineage reprogramming of glia in vivo. To study the in vivo reprogramming potential of human cells we will derive macroglia and pericytes from genome-edited human induced pluripotent stem cells, and after transplantation of these cells into the mouse cerebral cortex, we will induce lineage reprogramming at distinct stages of maturation. In vivo induced interneurons will be characterized for their functional properties and connectivity by electrophysiology and rabies virus tracing. We expect to obtain insights into the molecular logic underlying interneuron programmes, and to identify bottlenecks to lineage reprogramming dictated by the cells of origin, their developmental stage or local environment, as well as species differences in reprogramming competence.

Migrants, especially people of Sub-Saharan African heritage, are extremely affected for reasons that are unclear. This project aims to understand the mechanisms underlying the high risk of hypertension among African migrants by assessing the role of epigenetic modifications that result from rapid socio-environmental and behaviour change. To achieve this, Agyemang and his team will establish an innovative transcontinental prospective cohort study of a homogeneous group of Sub-Saharan African migrants (Ghanaians) living in the Netherlands and non-migrant Ghanaians living in rural and urban Ghana. We will first examine and identify the key changes in modifiable environmental factors influencing the high risk of hypertension among migrants. Second, we will examine changes in epigenetic modifications and their effects on hypertension risk in migrants. Third, we will identify the key environmental factors that are driving the epigenetic changes. Last, we will estimate for the first time the individual and combined effect of environmental factors, and epigenetic modifications to the high risk of hypertension in migrants relative to non-migrant Europeans and Ghanaian counterparts living in Africa. This project will yield new insights into the key drivers of hypertension and deliver a major breakthrough in knowledge about prevention and treatment among African and other population groups.

High throughput methods have allowed an “initial glimpse” into pathogenesis and have laid the foundations for a molecular-based taxonomy for personalized therapy. Based on our experience with the molecular characterization of SLE, a recently completed RNA sequencing analysis of 150 patients, and our track- record of “paradigm shift” trials in SLE, we will integrate data from multi-tissue analyses with novel technologies to improve its diagnosis, monitoring and therapy, and ask fundamental pathogenetic questions in systemic autoimmunity. More specifically, we will design gene expression panels and “expression profile”/”clinical trait” correlation matrices for diagnostics, personalized immunotherapy and improved clinical trial design. In a systematic multi-tissue approach, we will examine the role of somatic mutations in enhancing immune hyperactivity and the risk for lymphoma. The staggering (7-9:1) female predominance will be elucidated through elaborate genomic, epigenomic and microbiota analyses of family trios. Finally, we will be pursuing the innovative hypothesis that the fundamental abnormalities of SLE lie within the bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) - from which all cells that participate in the pathogenesis of SLE originate - and establish it as a unifying pathogenetic mechanism. By a combination of novel experimental analyses with single cell genomics, multi–omics, humanized animal models, genome editing and an “organ on-a-chip” device, we will validate HSCs as a therapeutic target. The utility of SLE research extends beyond its boundaries, by providing unique insights as to how the immune system recognizes self-constituents and maintains its homeostasis, and how gender impacts on disease biology.

824	Dr. Etienne Bucher	French National Institute for Agricultural Research	None	2017-06-01	2022-05-31	Directed crop breeding using jumping genes	The rapidly changing climate puts commonly used crop plants under strong pressure. It is therefore essential to develop novel breeding technologies to rapidly enhance crops to better withstand newly emerging stresses. Interestingly, a clear link between transposable elements (TEs), crop improvement and varietal diversification exists. Furthermore, in recent years the importance of (TEs) in evolution and adaptation to stresses has been recognized. However the use of TEs in crop breeding is currently very limited because it is not possible to control TE mobility. My research group has identified a novel highly conserved epigenetic silencing mechanism that represses the activity of TEs in Arabidopsis. We also found drugs capable of inhibiting this mechanism. Because these drugs target highly conserved enzymes we were able to show that our drug treatment is also effective in rice. We are therefore able to produce TE bursts in a controlled manner in virtually any plant. We can thus, for the first time, generate and study TE bursts in crop plants in real time. More importantly, we found that the accumulation of novel insertions of a heat-stress inducible TE produced plants that, at a high frequency, were more resistant to heat stress. This suggests that the stress that was initially applied to activate a specific TE in the parent, lead to an improved tolerance to that specific stress in the progeny of that plant in a very straight-forward manner. In this project I propose to accelerate plant breeding by testing and implementing a revolutionary TE-directed crop improvement technology. For that I plan to 1. Mobilize TEs in crop plants using selected stresses 2. Using these mobilized stress-responsive TEs breed novel crop plants resistant to those selected stresses and 3. Study the genetic and epigenetic impact of TE mobilization on host genomes. This project will have a broad impact on crop improvement and on the basic understanding of the evolutionary importance of TEs.	European Research Council	Consolidator Grant	1965625.0	EUR
825	Professor Nigel Mongan	University of Nottingham	None	2017-03-01	2020-08-21	Novel therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of hormone refractory prostate cancer	Androgen Receptor (AR) is central to prostate cancer (PCa) tumorigenesis and metastases. While androgen deprivation therapies (ADT) impede tumor progression, hormone refractory PCa (HRPC) typically arises within ~18 months. HRPCs escape androgen dependency and are incurable. The AR regulates target genes by recruiting coregulators to promote transcription. The mechanisms involved in HRPC include AR mutations/splice variants and/or alterations in AR-coregulators. AR-coregulators, in particular &lsquo;druggable&rsquo; enzymes including lysine demethylases (KDMs), offer alternative targets to circumvent resistance to existing ADTs. KDM1A inhibitors have entered cancer clinical trials. For this reason our research seeks to validate, through proof of concept models, a subset of AR-coregulators as novel drug targets to inhibit androgen signaling in PCa. We recently found that AR regulation of the miR137 tumor suppressor in turn down-regulates expression of AR coregulators, including KDM1A and KDM7A, thereby attenuating androgen signaling. However this negative feedback pathway is compromised in PCa, thus enhancing AR-KDM activity. Moreover, we and others previously showed that increased KDM1A is associated with poorer PCa outcomes by promoting pro-metastatic pathways. We have new evidence identifying KDM7A as a novel AR coregulator involved in androgen signaling in PCa. Thus both KDM1A and KDM7A act to promote AR signaling. Our hypothesis is that AR, KDM1A and KDM7A cooperate to drive PCa progression. To test this hypothesis we will (1) confirm the clinical significance of KDM7A in localized and metastatic PCa specimens and (2) use CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing coupled with next generation RNAseq, supported by pharmacological approaches, to further investigate the functions of KDM1A and KDM7A in AR signaling. Our objectives will establish the pre-clinical evidence for using drugs targeting KDM function in PCa. Similar epigenetic-targeting drugs are already in use and in clinical trials for other cancers and may offer more selective and better tolerated treatments than existing therapies for advanced PCa.

This intimate contact between parasite and host provides a molecular basis for communication which results in gene expression changes in both parasite and host. A case in point is stage-specific production of cyst wall components when the appropriate environmental conditions are met. Previous data highlight two categories of stage-specifically regulated genes; either de novo transcribed (cyst wall protein genes) or up regulated during encystation. Based on this and other data, we hypothesize that, when conditions for proliferation are no longer met, signaling for maintenance of the trophozoite state is lost and replaced with activation of the encystation program. This requires signal-dependent de-repression of cyst wall protein (CWP) gene expression, ending in deposition of a polymerized extracellular matrix (the cyst wall) which allows for parasite survival and transmission outside the host. Testing of this hypothesis is articulated around three subprojects. In Subproject 1 we will define the molecular basis for stage-specific CWP gene expression by taking advantage of new tools and high throughput technology to characterize epigenetic, genetic, and post transcriptional factors determining activation and negative feedback regulation of CWP expression. Using partial complementation of CWP1-3 KO phenotypes, in Subproject 2 we will capitalize on a recently developed gene knockout system to dissect the contribution of each CWP and individual domains to the trafficking program of encystation. Finally, in Subproject 3 we propose to use the recently established stem-cell dependent small intestinal organoid infection model as a controlled luminal space to analyze genome-wide expression data linked to trophozoite proliferation and to define an infection secretome for G. lamblia. This data will allow us to build an experimentally-validated, forward genetics-driven, integrated model of the molecular networks that govern the “program” for the alternating of G. lamblia between states of proliferation and encystation. This complex circuit for cell differentiation in an evolutionarily reduced eukaryote may provide clues on similar phenomena occurring in other encysting parasitic species and perhaps even in more complex eukaryotes.

There is no established way of prevention. Very high financial burden of health care costs, inadequate control of severe forms of allergic diseases and lack of curative therapies are main unmet needs. Background: Epithelial barrier function of bronchial epithelial cells in the asthmatic lung, sinus epithelial cells in the sinus tissue of chronic rhinosinusitis patients as well as keratinocytes in the skin of atopic dermatitis patients have been recently demonstrated to be defective. When the barrier integrity is disturbed in patients, allergens, bacterial toxins and other particles are able to penetrate the epithelium, where they may activate the immune system leading to severe chronic inflammation. Epithelial tight junctions (TJ) consist of different transmembrane and adaptor proteins and form the most apical intercellular junction essential for barrier function between epithelial cells. They are responsible for the regulation of paracellular flux and epithelial impermeability. In addition, they prevent foreign particles, such as allergens to enter into subepithelial layers. In contrast, opening of TJs can lead to drainage of inflammatory cells towards the lumen, supporting the resolution of phlogistic processes. Consequently, TJs can be considered as gatekeepers that could contribute both to aggravation of inflammation-related tissue damage or resolution of inflammation via drainage. Although barrier leakiness has been detected as a phenomenon in asthma, its pathophysiological mechanisms have not been demonstrated so far.Planned experiments: We aim to clarify several essential aspects that play a role in the dysregulation of bronchial epithelial barrier in asthma. We will first investigate the role of innate immune response factors, particularly NOD-like receptors, RIG-1-like receptors, AIM2-like receptors in both human tissues, human primary epithelial cells and transgenic mouse models that are deficient in certain fractions of these receptors. In this model, we will develop bone-marrow chimeras to differentiate between hematopoietic versus structural origins of the observed effects on barrier defects in response to house dust mite. This will be followed by the investigation of Th2, Th17 and Treg cell subsets. We will investigate the regulation of the expression of TJ molecules, the role of T cell subsets and their major cytokines to barrier integrity, both in air-liquid interface cultures of human primary epithelial cells and mouse model of house dust mite-induced asthma. In the present study, we aim to expand our bronchial epithelial air liquis interfaces to artificial 3D lungs. This is mainly because of a substantial requirement to develop human artificial 3D organs to investigate cells and mediators of inflammation in asthma and other allergic inflammatory diseases. Our preliminary data demonstrate strong evidence that epigenetic factors play an essential role in epithelial leakiness in asthma. We will use bisulfite treatment for investigating DNA methylation and chromatin immunoprecipitation to demonstrate histone modifications and protein-chromatin interactions to determine the mechanisms of epigenetic regulation in asthma compared to healthy bronchial epithelium. We will perform whole genome next generation sequencing as well as immunoprecipitated chromatine sequencing approach.Innovative potential: The present study aims to contribute to understanding molecular mechanisms of leaky epithelial barrier in asthma. This leakiness should be early diagnosed and appropriately treated to prevent asthma development. Better understanding the molecular mechanisms of the bronchial barrier in the pathogenesis of asthma is an area of translational research that encompasses many fields and is expected to receive a great deal of attention. This knowledge can be applied to other diseases that epithelial barrier dysregulation may play a role, such as atopic dermatitis, chronic rhinosinusitis and inflammatory bowel diseases.

828	Dr. Leonie RINGROSE	Austrian Academy of Sciences	None	2009-07-01	2013-06-30	Non-coding RNA of Polycomb/Trithorax Response Elements	The highly conserved Polycomb (PcG) and Trithorax (TrxG) group proteins constitute an epigenetic cellular memory system that is essential for maintaining the correct identity of both stem cells and differentiated cells. Despite enormous progress in recent years defining the biochemical properties of the PcG and TrxG proteins, and mapping their target sites in whole genomes, the mechanisms of PcG and TrxG silencing and activation remain obscure. Still less do we understand transitions between these states, and their stable inheritance from one cell generation to the next, a question that lies at the heart of epigenetic research. PcG and TrxG proteins maintain gene activity by binding to Polycomb/Trithorax response elements (PRE/TREs). In flies, several hundred genes are regulated by PRE/TREs, but these elements are best characterised in the Hox genes of the Bithorax complex. During embryogenesis, the Hox PRE/TREs are transcribed in to non coding RNA. Recent studies have examined the role of this non coding transcription in regulation of PRE/TRE elements. Currently, there is strong disagreement as to whether the noncoding transcripts are important for silencing or activation of PRE/TRE associated genes. We have recently published a detailed review of this field, and have shown that, by taking developmental timing into account, some of these apparently conflicting results can be resolved. The project proposed here aims to study noncoding PRE/TRE transcription in the context of developmental timing in Drosophila melaongaster, and consists of two parts, namely 1) Quantitative characterisation of PRE/TRE non-coding RNAs during development. Using quantitative real time PCR, in situ hybridisation and transgenic reporter assays we aim to quantify the effect of PRE/TRE non-coding transcription on mRNA transcription at different developmental stages. 2) Purification of PRE/TRE non-coding RNAs and their binding partners at different developmental stages. We will use StreptoTag affinity purification of PRE/TRE non-coding RNAs in vitro and in transgenic flies, to identify binding partners at different developmental stages. The results of this work will have implications not only for understanding the role of non coding transcription in PRE/TRE regulation, but also for placing these events in their correct developmental context.

Although major advances in the treatment of MPN have been made in recent years, most MPN are incurable chronic disorders with substantial morbidity and mortality. The only curative treatment approach that can be offered at present is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Unfortunately, this procedure can only be performed in a small group of patients (young and fit). In all other patients, management is largely based on symptom-control and the use of growth-inhibitory drugs. However, most drugs used thus far in MPN, including the recently developed tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), have little if any curative potential. In addition, resistance to growth-inhibitory drugs is often seen in advanced MPN. So far, little is known about molecules, signaling networks, and mechanisms underlying disease evolution, progression, and resistance in various MPN. The situation is complicated by the fact that neoplastic stem cells (SC) exhibit intrinsic resistance, have multiple interactions with the SC-protective microenvironment, the so-called ?stem cell niche?, and acquire resistance in multiple subclones during disease evolution. Finally, the genetic background as well as epigenetic mechanisms are considered to play a role in disease evolution and progression in MPN. The general aim of this research program is to address the cellular, biochemical and functional complexity in various MPN by an integrated multidisciplinary approach, to exploit network analyses and resulting concepts to define critical target profiles in neoplastic (stem) cells, and to develop targeted treatment-strategies. The specific long-term aim of the SFB is to develop novel SC-eradicating treatment approaches in Ph+ and Ph- MPN. Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) will serve as a paradigmatic disease model in this SFB. In addition, the SFB will focus on JAK2 V617F-mutated MPN, KIT D816V-mutated systemic mastocytosis (SM) and mast cell leukemia (MCL), and FIP1L1/PDGFRA+ chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL). It can be expected that the SFB will substantially contribute to a better understanding of molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the etiology, progression, and resistance of neoplastic cells in these MPN. Furthermore, data generated in this SFB should provide a solid basis for the development of improved diagnostic and therapeutic concepts in these neoplasms.

The source of proprioceptive signals are specialized sense organs (proprioceptors) in skeletal muscles and their tendons. The eyes are the most mobile body organs and proprioception from extraocular muscles (EOMs) is essential for effective vision. Surprisingly, classical proprioceptors are absent in the EOMs of most mammals and are substituted by a nerve specialization termed palisade ending. Palisade endings are present in all frontal-eyed but not in all lateral-eyed species suggesting that they are particularly important for the former. Their locations at the muscle-tendon junction and some structural similarities with Golgi tendon organs, has placed palisade endings as candidates providing eye position information. This was put into the question when our molecular and neuronal tracer studies showed that palisade endings exhibit characteristics which are more compatible with motor structures. These findings have reopened the discussion about palisade endings and it is still unclear whether they are sensory or motor. The project will continue our research on palisade endings and will be done in international cooperation with the Profs. Angel Pastor and Rosa de la Cruz from the University of Seville. The primary objective is to analyze the function of palisade endings while a second objective is to analyze their development. Functional signature of palisade endings. Since there is still uncertainty about the function of palisade endings, we will test two hypotheses which will sort out whether palisade endings are motor or sensory. For both hypotheses, we will use a molecular and physiological approach. Molecularly, we want to test whether palisade endings have receptors for cholinergic transmission or mechanosensitive channel proteins. Physiologically, we want to test if electrical activation of palisade endings would change motoneuron activity in the EOM motor nuclei. Developmental signature of palisade endings. Novel, developmental data have shown in cat that palisade endings develop following a different time course in different EOMs. These findings allow two interpretations: The heterochronic sequence of palisade ending development is genetically programmed or alternatively influenced by external sources like vision or eye movements. By dark rearing and/or eye immobilization, we will sort out whether palisade endings maturation is genetically programmed or driven by epigenetic factors. Present findings will help to settle a long-lasting discussion about the function of palisade endings. Palisade endings are also found in human EOMs and are accidentally destroyed in many surgical procedures to treat strabismus. Thus, knowledge of the functional significance of palisade endings would be of particular interest for strabismus surgeons.	Austrian Science Fund FWF	None	239163.75	EUR

Many insights into the processes of self-renewal have been gained by studying leukaemic cancer stem cells (LSC). Pioneering work in this area has demonstrated that certain recurrent fusion genes resulting from chromosomal translocations can confer stem cell properties and re-activate a self-renewal program in committed haematopoietic progenitors. One such fusion gene is MOZ-TIF2. Monocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (MOZ) is a transcriptional co-activator and a histone acetyl transferase (HAT) . MOZ is the catalytic component of a larger multi-subunit protein complex that includes other chromatin-associated proteins. This higher-order complex is thought to aid in targeting the catalytic activity of MOZ to effect transcriptional control. My project will aim to identify the direct and indirect genomic targets of MOZ-TIF2. In parallel, I will also endeavour to isolate and fully characterise the members of the MOZ-TIF2 complex with a view to identifying the molecular mechanisms by which t his complex reads the epigenetic landscape and is recruited to its target genes on chromatin. These insights will be further studied in murine models of MOZ-TIF2 induced leukaemia to determine their role in the malignant self-renewal properties conferred by MOZ-TIF2. Finally, we will explore the potential of HAT inhibitors as a novel therapeutic strategy in leukaemia.	Wellcome Trust	Intermediate Clinical Fellowship	803690.0	GBP

Over 90% of relapsed patients will die from their disease. The biological mechanisms underlying this are poorly understood and have not been investigated in any detail. Relevance to Cancer. Central nervous system (CNS) tumours are the most common paediatric malignancies of which medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant tumour. Deaths from this tumour are responsible for 10% of childhood cancer deaths. Anticipated benefits This research will enhance our understanding of the molecular basis of relapsed disease so we can potentially identify biological markers associated with relapse, and discover specific biological pathways that may be targets for future novel therapies. Outline plan of research In this study we will assemble a large cohort (up to 50) of relapsed MBs, together with their accompanying primary diagnostic biopsy, and characterise this cohort on a genome-wide basis with respect to epigenetic alterations at diagnosis and relapse, using the Illumina GoldenGate Cancer Panel I DNA methylation array. Following data analysis of the clinical, pathological and epigenetic features of this cohort, we will identify and validate biological markers associated with disease relapse, and identify biological pathways that may be targeted in future therapeutic strategies.

Work on the transcriptional and epigenetic programmes underlying commitment, lineage specification and differentiation within normal haematopoiesis will inevitably inform studies to expand and manipulate haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. An important aim will then be to translate this into clinical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) practice which to date, provides the only example of routine clinical application of stem cell therapy. Understanding how individual, key transcriptional regulators such as Runx1, SCL, LMO2, Tel, GATA2 and GATA1, Pu.1, C/EBPa cytokine signalling pathways and chromatin modifying enzymes such as MLL1 influence cell fate decisions is important for understanding how such regulators control normal haematopoiesis and how, when mutated, they contribute to the abnormal cell proliferation and differentiation associated with haematological malignancy. This will be complemented by examining the impact of leukaemic fusions on the transcriptional networks of blood cells in mouse and the embryonic zebrafish aiming to elucidate the mechanisms by which commonly identified fusions initiate leukaemogenesis. The MHU also has significant programmes that have made high profile contributions to identifying and fully characterising pre-leukaemic and leukaemic stem cells (LSC) in primary human samples. LSC are important because they are postulated to be a key cellular source of relapse. If this is shown to be the case, failure to eradicate LSC is likely to provide an early cellular marker of treatment failure and provide novel opportunities to develop LSC-targeted therapy that would improve clinical outcomes. These programmes have brought together international and UK clinical collaborators working within respected clinical trial group structures that will facilitate transfer of work from these programmes into clinical practice.

Several investigations have shown that normal haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and their progenitor progeny could serve as a cell of origin of leukaemia. The leukaemia derived from distinct cells of origin are known to have distinct molecular characteristics and prognostic outlooks. Mouse and human studies about leukemic cell of origin have clearly shown that epigenetic alterations, such as histone modifications and DNA methylation play an important role in leukemic transformation process. These epigenetic alterations are again very distinct for HSCs and their progeny. Thus, investigations about epigenetic alterations regulating leukemic transformation of cell of origin are critically dependent on analysis of pure and near homogeneous population of HSCs or its progenitor progeny. To investigate epigenetic and transcriptional basis of leukemic transformation, we have established a model in our lab, where we can transform human cord blood derived HSCs and their progenitor progeny lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitor (LMPP), and multi-potent progenitors (MPP) using specified oncogenic fusion (e.g. MLL-AF9). These transformed cells develop leukaemia in mice on transplantation. In order to assess epigenetic alteration during this leukemic transformation, we wish to perform a genome-wide analysis for DNA methylation and histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K27me2, H3K9me3, H3 acetylation) analysis. The limited cell number of normal HSCs/LMPPs/MPPs (10,000 – 20,000 cells/sample) available to use hampered the utilisation of tradition sequencing protocols. We would like to take advantage of linear DNA amplification (LinDA) method to amplify DNA in order to perform whole genome sequencing studies. The recent paper from the lab of Prof. Hinrich Gronemeyer from Institute of Genetics and Molecular and Cellular Biology (IGBMC), Strasburg, France have conclusively shown that about ~30pg of DNA or 5,000 starting cell number is sufficient for LinDA to generate high quality whole-genome sequencing data using LinDA (Shankaranarayanan et al., 2012; Shankaranarayanan et al., 2011). The present travel grant application is to visit Prof. Gronemeyer’s lab in Strasburg to learn LinDA and its application for ChIP-Seq analysis. The sequencing data will be analysed in our lab by myself and resident bioinformatician post-doctoral research associate. This project will assess the comprehensive epigenetic changes during leukemic transformation of distinct human cells of origin for the first time. Successful completion will open newer collaborative avenues (e.g. chromatin analysis) and will assist CRUK funded projects in lab.	Cancer Research UK	NIC - Research Travel Award	None	None

Alterations of epigenetic marks, impacting on gene expression, are one mechanism that could explain such long-term impact. These hypotheses have so far been tested mostly in animals, and little for atmospheric pollutants, for which animal evidence is scarce. We aim to characterize the impact of environmental exposures on childhood health. Our focus is on two families of pollutants with a highly prevalent and controllable exposure in humans: atmospheric pollutants and specific high-volume non-persistent chemicals (Bisphenol A, other phenols and phthalates). These pollutants are archetypal of modern life pollutants challenging environmental health research. We will set up a new type of mother-child cohort with early recruitment in pregnancy, intense follow-up (including geolocalisation of subjects with GPS combined with fine-scale air pollution modelling), personal exposure monitoring (with low-cost reliable micro-sensors), repeated collection of biological samples. Transcriptomic analysis, non-invasive clinical examinations (Doppler and ultrasound imaging, ECG, early postnatal evaluation of lung function) will bring clues regarding target functions. This observational approach in humans will be supplemented by an animal experiment aiming at characterizing the impact of in utero exposure to traffic-related atmospheric pollutants on foetal development and health in adulthood, and characterizing target functions and organs more finely than the human study can allow.E-DOHaD spans over the whole range of environmental health disciplines, with epidemiologic and toxicologic studies being conducted in parallel to ease comparability and results synthesis.

Despite dramatic progress in epigenetics during the past decade, DNA demethylation remains one of the last big frontiers and very little is known about it. DNA demethylation is a widespread phenomenon and occurs in plants as well as in animals, during development, in the adult, and during somatic cell reprogramming of pluripotency genes. The molecular identity of the DNA “demethylase” in animal cells remained unresolved and has hampered progress in the field for decades. In 2007 we published that Growth Arrest and DNA Damage 45 a (Gadd45a) is a key player in active DNA demethylation, which opened new avenues in the study of this elusive process. The goal of this project is to further analyze the mechanism of DNA demethylation as well as the role played by Gadd45 in development. Given the many unresolved questions in this burgeoning field, our work promises to be ground-breaking and therefore have a profound impact in unraveling one of the least understood processes of gene regulation. Specifically we will address the following points. I) The biological role of Gadd45 mediated DNA demethylation in mouse embryos and adults is unknown. We have obtained mouse mutants for Gadd45a,b, and g and we will analyze them for developmental defects and dissect the methylation regulation of relevant genes. II) The targeting mechanism by which Gadd45 is binding to and demethylating specific sites in the genome is a central unresolved issue. We have identified a candidate DNA binding protein interacting with Gadd45 and we will analyze its role in site specific targeting of DNA demethylation in vitro and in mouse. III) We found that Gadd45 is an RNA binding protein and we will therefore analyze how non-coding RNAs are involved in targeting and/or activating Gadd45 during DNA demethylation.

Despite this fact, it has been one of the least studied cancer types in regard to molecular aetiology. Next generation sequencing of invasive bladder cancers have revealed a striking peculiarity: with the exception of the tumor suppressor p53, the most frequently mutated genes are involved in the epigenetic regulation of transcription. More specifically, members of the MLL family of histone 3 lysine 4 methylatransferases (H3K4Me3) as well as histone 3 lysine 27 demethylases are mutated in over 60% of the cases. These mutations appear to be loss-of-function implying that these proteins play a tumor suppressing role. In the absence, however, of functional studies the mechanistic aspects of this role remain elusive. We propose to focus our studies on a member of H3K4Me3 methylastransferases, namely MLL3, for two reasons: i) knockout of MLL3 in mice leads to urothelial tumorigenesis, and ii) the tumor suppressor role of the Notch signaling pathway in the bladder, that we and others have recently established, seems to rely on MLL3 activity. We propose a balanced combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments complemented with next generation sequencing, which will allow us to study in depth the mechanistic aspects of MLL3 functions, as well as analysis of primary human cancer specimens that will establish the clinical relevance of the proposed work. The proposed experiments will shed light into the tumor suppressor functions of MLL3 and Notch as well as their functional relationship in this process.

In order to ensure the sustainability of this sector it is critical to domesticate and selectively improve the major commercial fish species. To date, the genetic markers used in selective breeding of fish account only for a fraction of the observed phenotypic variation. EPIFISH is a scientifically innovative and timely project that will address fish domestication and selection from a new perspective using a multidisciplinary approach. The rapid pace of substantial phenotypic changes during adaptation to new environmental conditions in fish undergoing domestication raises the original hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms are involved in this process. Thus, the overarching aim of EPIFISH is to ascertain the importance of epigenetics in fish domestication using the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) as model species. Specific objectives are i) to determine how selection affects the miRNA transcriptome and the epigenetic landscape during domestication, ii) to perform a functional characterization of miRNA variants and epigenetic alleles associated with growth, and iii) to validate them as potential epigenetic markers for future selective breeding programmes. The identification of epigenetic markers will be a ground-breaking element of EPIFISH with major impact on aquaculture biotechnology, since they will enable the development and application of epigenomic selection as a new feature in future selective breeding programmes. Moreover, the project outcomes will provide novel mechanistic insights into the role of epigenetics in fish domestication, which will surely open new horizons for future frontier research in epigenetics, namely transgenerational inheritance and nutritional epigenetics.

839	Dr. Julia FEICHTINGER	Graz University of Technology	None	2018-01-01	2021-06-30	Antisense and Allele-specific Transcription in Human Cancer	Antisense and Allele-specific Transcription in Human Cancer Identification of cancer-restricted biomarkers is fundamental to the development of novel cancer therapies and diagnostic/prognostic stratification tools. Antisense transcripts have barely been studied in this regard but are likely to exhibit high potential for such applications. The term antisense transcript usually refers to a capped and polyadenylated transcript, which is at least partially complementary to a corresponding (mainly protein-coding) sense mRNA. These transcripts can have diverse functional roles in gene regulation, such as modifying epigenetic marks. The genomic arrangement of sense/antisense pairs also suggests that antisense transcripts are mainly involved in allele-specific gene regulation. In this project we, Dr. Julia Feichtinger (applicant) and Dr. Christoph Sensen (co-applicant) at Institute of Molecular Biotechnology, Graz University of Technology, propose for the first time an extended approach reaching beyond conducting individual studies on antisense and allele-specific expression. We aim to construct a comprehensive picture of these processes in a large panel of cancer samples and healthy controls by making use of the current wealth of transcriptomics and (epi)genomics data provided in the constantly growing public repositories. To this end, we will apply advanced bioinformatics methods to analyse these datasets in a high-throughput and highly optimised manner to obtain transcriptional resolution on all four DNA strands (both alleles). This is not routinely performed in expression studies and will resolve many, otherwise undetected, confounding results. Our main goal is to characterise the potential of antisense transcripts for clinical applications. The construction of comprehensive profiles to define tissue- and cancer-specific expression and the correlation with patient survival are crucial for this. Thereby, we expect to identify a number of novel candidates for therapeutic, diagnostic and prognostic applications. We aim to investigate antisense transcripts of germline genes in more detail as a model to determine whether antisense expression might be linked to oncogenesis, as a number of these genes are aberrantly expressed in cancer as well as are linked to oncogenesis and prognosis. As we hypothesise that antisense transcripts mainly exhibit allele-specific behaviour, we will investigate to what extent allele-specific expression is associated with antisense transcription. In cancers, allele-specific expression is highly elevated, which is mainly the result of copy number variations or changes in allelic compositions. However, we also hypothesise allele-specific epigenetic regulation to drive allele-specific expression, which in turn could partly be induced by (dysregulated) antisense transcripts. To this end, we will analyse multi-omics datasets to produce comprehensive regulatory associations. We further aim to generate annotation maps for sense/antisense pairs in various cancer and normal tissues, expecting these maps to become a powerful resource for the research community. In conclusion, we will investigate antisense and allele-specific transcription in a large-scale study, which will not only lead to new insights into gene regulation and provide novel diagnostic/prognostic marker and drug target candidates for clinical applications, but could also change the paradigm on how we conduct expression analyses in the future.

Regional body fat distribution is also a major risk factor for the rising burden of CVDs. Although body fat distribution is strongly associated with dyslipidemia, the causal pathways are still unclear. Therefore, we need to infer causal relationships between regional body fat distribution and circulating lipids and apolipoproteins to address the etiology of dyslipidemia and CVDs in Indian population. These causal inferences will help in developing interventions and management of high risk individuals. We aim to examine causal relationship between regional body fat distribution and levels of lipids and apolipoproteins using classical Mendelian Randomization (MR) approach using IV based on allelic scores. We will also explore the mediating role of DNA methylation in the causal relationship between body fat distribution and lipid and apolipoprotein levels by applying 2-step epigenetic MR approach. We will utilize the longitudinal data and biological samples from an ongoing surveillance study where study participants are measured for segmental body fat distribution and lipid profile. 2500 unrelated participants from Delhi will be genotyped using HumanCoreExome array and also imputed for significant loci from cardiometabochip data available on Indian population to derive instrument variables.

841	Dr Pritha Paul	Tata Medical Center, Kolkata	None	2018-01-01	2022-12-31	Investigation of aberrant TP53 regulation in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL)	Our clinical and laboratory work suggests that early relapses in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) are related to a microenvironment mediated stress adaptation, regulated either by a mutated TP53, or due to epigenetic regulation of TP53mutdownstream targets. The ability to survive stress, includes a metabolic shift, antiapoptic mechanisms and increased antioxidant production. We intend to identify the aberrant TP53mut pathways active in ALL, using cell lines and patient derived xenograft (PDX) samples carrying the defined TP53 mutations. Characterisation will involve the functional variations in response to cytotoxic and oxidative stress. Differential expression will be assessed by gene expression and quantitative proteomics and further verification will be obtained by identifying changes in TP53 promoter occupancy. Pathways derived will be compared with those generated from gene expression of TP53wt patients samples and xenografts with an early relapse. Potentially our work will lead to an understanding of how aberrant TP53 regulation promotes cell survival and whether TP53 regulated pathways play a far more important role in the therapeutic failure in ALL than previously realised. Therapeutically our focus is on identifying exisiting drugs that may modify chemoresistance to improve outcomes in children with ALL.

842	Prof. Daniel SUMMERER	Dortmund University of Technology	None	2017-11-01	2022-10-31	Programmable Readers, Writers, and Erasers of the Epigenetic Cytosine Code	Human DNA contains two types of biologically instructive information: the canonical nucleobases A, G, T, C, and the epigenetic nucleobases mC, hmC, fC, and caC. Canonical nucleobases encode the identity of all RNAs and proteins that are synthesized by a cell, whereas epigenetic nucleobases regulate this synthesis. This regulation shapes the phenotype of cells, and its perturbation is a key trigger of cancer. Canonical nucleobases can be decoded in a programmable manner by nucleic acids and their analogs via Watson-Crick-base pairing, and the simplicity of this recognition has enabled revolutionary developments in the biological sciences. In contrast, comparable developments in epigenetics have not yet been possible, since a molecular scaffold with programmable recognition of epigenetic nucleobases does not exist. We will establish the first class of molecules capable of the expanded programmable recognition of both canonical and epigenetic DNA nucleobases in vitro and in vivo. This is based on transcription-activator-like effectors (TALEs) that consist of four types of concatenated modules, each of which recognizes a canonical nucleobase. We have recently reported the detection of single epigenetic nucleobases by TALEs. In this project, we will 1. engineer a toolbox of TALE modules with selectivity for C, mC, hmC, fC, and caC, 2. employ them for TALE-based in vitro typing and profiling (reading) of cancer biomarker mC/hmC, and 3. design photoactivatable TALE-fusions that enable the writing and erasing of mC at user-defined genomic loci in vivo with spatiotemporal resolution. This will provide the first insights into the dynamic effects of de novo editing on chromatin regulation, and enables the imprinting of regulatory states. Given the central role of epigenetic nucleobases in cancer and the universality of our approach, this project will provide enabling and broadly applicable methodology for cancer epigenetics research, diagnosis and therapy.

843	Eric Aeby	Department of Molecular Biology Massachusetts General Hospital Harvard Medical School	Department of Molecular Biology Massachusetts General Hospital Harvard Medical School	2015-09-01	2017-08-31	The Jpx interactome and lncRNA-mediated epigenetic regulation of X-chromosome inactivation	Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA), which are transcripts defined by a minimal length of 200 nucleotides and the absence of protein-coding potential, play an important role in the regulation of chromatin structure. A biological function for lncRNAs was first proposed when the RNA molecules H19 and Xist, lacking protein-coding sequences, were discovered. Although Xist lncRNA was shown to be essential for X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), suggesting a role in chromatin regulation, the precise mechanism remained unknown. This function in chromatin regulation was confirmed later when Hotair and Xist lncRNAs were shown to recruit the PRC2 complex, inducing heterochromatin formation at the HoxD locus and of the whole X-chromosome, respectively. Additional lncRNAs were then sporadically identified and proposed to play different functions, often linked to epigenetic mechanisms. Ultimately, the development of next-generation sequencing and tiling arrays technologies greatly facilitated the identification of lncRNAs. The development of new techniques, combined with functional genomics, resulted in the identification of a large number of lncRNA species and their assignment to different biological functions, but functions have been addressed only for a minority of lncRNAs. Thus, the challenge is now to understand if and how the large number of lncRNAs regulates chromatin structure and gene expression. In the examples studied, lncRNAs often play the role of a scaffold to hold protein complexes together or a recruiting platform to target proteins to specific gene loci. However, how these interactions are regulated and the protein partners bound by the lncRNAs remain largely unknown.I propose to tackle these questions combining genetic approaches and state-of-the-art proteomics analysis. In the Lee Lab, I will address an open question in epigenetics - how X-chromosome inactivation is regulated in mammals. Aside from dissecting the mechanism of X-chromosome inactivation regulation, this research project should shed light on general lncRNA biology. Identifying lncRNA-binding partners will allow to elucidate their mechanisms of action and to test these mechanisms by targeted experiments. Thus, I anticipate this study will help defining the modes of action of lncRNAs, aiming at better understanding how lncRNAs shape our genome.

These cells represent one reservoir from where the virus can reinitiate new rounds of infection. The process leading to latency, and to reactivation are important steps for the characterization of pharmacological and immunological agents targeting this reservoir.We have, over the last two years, analyzed in great detail the dynamic process of the productive viral replication cycle integrating genome-wide viral and cellular parameters. The study identified the profound perturbation of the cell physiology upon infection, and the capacity of the virus to complete the replication cycle despite significant downregulation of numerous cellular processes. This approach used deep sequencing of the transcriptome, analysis of integration events, and more recently ChIP-seq of Tat interaction with the host DNA and SILAC assessment of the proteome. These data have been integrated into a probabilistic model relating transcriptional changes to specific steps in the viral life cycle. We will build on this benchmark and expertise to assess the process of latency. Specifically the present proposal includes:•Implementation of in vitro experimental models of latency.•Standardized conditions of reactivation using immunological and pharmacological agents.•Dynamic assessment of transcriptome reprogramming and proteome modification during the process of establishment and maintenance of latency, and reactivation from the latent state.•Assessment of epigenetic modifications of the HIV promoter during those dynamic steps.•Assessment of HIV integration site contribution to the establishment of latency and to reactivation.•Study of heterogeneity of the process of latency and reactivation at the population level.•Examination of key features at the single-cell level.The laboratory has generated preliminary and feasibility data on many of these points, as well as technological, bioinformatics, and mathematical approaches to data generation and analysis.This project responds to specific priorities of the HIV Cure Research agenda published in 2012. With a design that emphasizes dynamic analyses, the project should result in (i) novel insights into the extent of “true” latency, i.e., absolute HIV transcriptional silence, (ii) assessment of the role of spatial features of viral integration contributing to transcription, (iii) proposal of candidate biomarkers of latency, and (iv) the characterization of successful activation programs leading to viral expression at population and single cell level.

Since tumor infiltrating Tregs can display function heterogeneity, depending on both the tumor type and the inflammatory milieu, only inhibition of the right Treg activity should result in the unleash of an effective anti-tumor T cell responses. Experimental plan: To identify the Tregs that truly inhibit anti-tumor T cells, we will profile by RNA-Seq the transcriptome of Tregs infiltrating both tumor and healthy tissues. In particular, we will focus on LncRNAs and the gene networks they modulate, since they have recently emerged as relevant epigenetic regulators of cell differentiation and identity. We will exploit this new knowledge to create a panel of regulatory transcripts, which will be assessed at single cell level on tumor infiltrating Tregs, so to determine the association of specific transcripts with different Treg populations. Since downregulation of specific lncRNAs might be an efficient way to inhibit the "unwanted" Tregs at tumor sites, we aim at targeting lncRNAs uniquely expressed in these Tregs and propose to develop AsiCs, chimeric molecules composed by an aptamer, single stranded oligonucleotides that bind to cell surface markers, and a siRNA, short RNAs downregulating specific lncRNAs. Deliverables and conclusions: this proposal will provide new knowledge on tumor infiltrating Tregs possibly allowing definition of molecular signatures of Tregs with either positive or negative effects on antitumor T cell responses. Moreover, we will develop new molecules that specifically target lncRNAs of interest and that will help identifying new antitumor therapeutic targets. In conclusion, the possibility to modulate Tregs effector functions may not only offer new anti-tumor therapy but more in general may be relevant to any immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies.

846	Ass.Prof. Dr. Gaia NOVARINO	INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AUSTRIA	None	2019-04-01	2022-03-31	IMPACT	Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) represent a large and heterogeneous group of rare disorders. Individual types of NDDs with a known genetic etiology are typically rare, owing to the very high number of individual genes that are causative for such conditions, but their aggregate societal impact is dramatic. Among the causative mutated genes, most are involved in two broad functional domains, synaptic processes and chromatin regulation (“epigenetic mechanisms”). In this proposal we selected five distinct NDDs: Kabuki, Kleefstra, Gabriele-de Vries, Helsmoortel-Van der Aa, and a syndromic type of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) caused, respectively, by mutations in KMT2D, EHMT1, YY1, ADNP and CHD8. The uniquely informative edge of jointly studying these specific NDDs stems from the involvement of the causative genes in inter-related chromatin pathways, both directly and through their associated protein partners, and from the observation of major overlapping clinical features. We thus hypothesize that mutations in these five genes give rise to major transcriptional dysregulation in both common as well as unique gene regulatory networks, thereby generating shared and unique downstream effects in gene transcription and translation. Therefore, the IMPACT collaborative project aims to reveal common molecular and cellular signatures of chromatinopathy gene disruptions. Such converging mechanisms of disease offer an attractive target for the development of knowledge-based therapeutic interventions across individual NDDs that can potentially be useful for designing interventions suitable for multiple related rare neurodevelopmental disorders.

Subsequently, I will replicate/validate my findings in an independent set of GDM samples (N=200/800). Association testing will be carried out by fitting probe-wise linear models, with adjustments for biological and technical confounders (control probe principal components). The relevance of DNA methylation hits can be tested by robust pathway enrichment tests of genes associated with the differentially methylated CpG sites with functional ontologies using custom developed scripts that adjust for probe coverage bias (goseq). Overlaying relevant Roadmap Epigenome data by performing permutation tests utilizing random sampling of matched CpG sites. I expect this work to identify specific DNA methylation sites, with a detectable and predominant association with GDM. In the later stages of the fellowship, I will lead the experimental design for the methylation experiments by performing large-scale epigenome-wide association scans. This will include detecting associations of IUGR/SGA with methylation by using cases and controls recruited at delivery (N=600/600) and finding methylation marker associated with foetal growth in a longitudinal study (N~2,500) with multiple anthropometric measurements throughout pregnancy. The multi-ethnic design of this study will also allow me to establish transethnic effects. Lastly, I will be utilizing genetic variants as instrumental variables in two-step Mendelian Randomization to determine whether epigenetic markers are in causal pathways downstream to intra-uterine events.

First discovered in Drosophila, where they are required for silencing of homeotic gene expression, polycomb proteins have since been found to play a key role in mammalian development and the maintenance of stem cell identity. Their disregulation is associated with aberrant gene experssion in a range of malignancies. The general aim of the project is to study the function of Polycomb group proteins at a well defined mammalian locus, the alpha globin gene cluster, in order to establish general principles of Polycomb function in mammals. In embryonic stem cells several hundred genes are bound by Polycomb. During development, removal of Polycomb is essential for activation of lineage-specific genes. The mechanisms governing this removal in mammals remain obscure. The specific goal of the project is to study this process at the alpha globin gene locus. This locus has been the subject of intense investigation by the host laboratory and is consequently amongst the best characterised mammalian gene clusters. The host laboratory has shown that Polycomb proteins bind to regions of the alpha globin cluster silencing expression in embryonic stem and non-erythroid cells but in differentiated erythroid cells binding is absent. The first aim of the project is to establish the timing of Polycomb removal during erythroid differentiation. We will isolate by FACS populations enriched in haematopoietic stem cells and various progenitor populations from primary bone marrow samples. The presence of Polycomb at the alpha globin locus will be determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and real time PCR. Current ChIP protocols require a minimum of 106 cells, however only 103 to 105 cells of each progenitor population can be obtained from a single bone marrow sample. Therefore we will employ a novel ChIP method in which Drosophila cells are added as a 'Carrier'. This technique can reliably analyse as few as 100-1000 cells. The second aim of the project is to determine the sequences required for Polycomb recruitment and for removal during differentiation. We will employ mononucleosomal ChIP and a tiled array to determine Polycomb binding at single nucleosome resolution across the alpha globin locus. We will also characterise Polycomb binding in erythroid cell lines (interspecies hybrids) containing deletions of previously identified cis-regulatory regions and of the alpha globin promotors. We hope to discover general principles governing removal of Polycomb during mammalian development.	Medical Research Council	Fellowship	213128.0	GBP
849	Dr. Kazufumi MOCHIZUKI	Institute of Molecular Biotechnology	None	2014-01-01	2016-12-31	Small RNA-mediated transgenerational genome surveillance	Small RNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing is a fundamental cellular process in most eukaryotes including fungi, plants, flies, worms and mammals. One of the main tasks of small RNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing is to neutralize the activity of transposons. However, the mechanisms by which cells distinguish between transposons and their own genomes and by which they selectively target the former with small RNAs are not fully understood. The ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena identifies transposon-derived sequences by a whole-genome transgenerational surveillance mechanism using small RNAs. Tetrahymena undergoes extensive programmed DNA elimination when the germline micronucleus produces the new macronucleus during sexual reproduction. Many of the DNA segments that are eliminated are related to transposons, and DNA elimination is regulated by small RNAs (scnRNAs) approximately 28-30 nucleotides in length that are produced and function by an RNAi-related mechanism. The study proposed here will investigate how Tetrahymena epigenetically identifies transposon-derived sequences by small RNAs and will greatly increase our understanding of the process of small RNA-mediated self-nonself recognition in general eukaryotes. Our recent studies indicated that DNA elimination in Tetrahymena occurs through two epigenetic mechanisms: 1) biased scnRNA production from the eliminated sequences in the micronucleus and 2) selective degradation of scnRNAs that are complementary to the non-eliminated sequences in the parental macronucleus. We proposed that the former mechanism is transgenerationally regulated by the grandparental macronuclear genome and is epigenetically maintained as a chromatin state during vegetative growth and that the latter mechanism determines self and nonself sequences in the genome. This proposal aims to clarify these two key but poorly understood mechanisms in small RNA-mediated DNA elimination by artificially perturbing the epigenetic cycle and by genetically and biochemically characterizing novel factors involved in DNA elimination.

The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene is a major oncogene in NB, and ALK activating mutations or wild-type (wt) expression are associated with poor clinical outcome. The implication of ALK-wt, and the ALK activating mutations, ALK-F1174L, and ALK-R1275Q, in NC progenitor fate and neuroblastomagenesis was previously investigated using immortalized murine neural crest progenitor cells (NCPC), MONC-1 and JoMa-1. In vivo studies by orthotopic (adrenal gland) implantations reveled that MONC-1 cells could generate various tumor types, such as NB, osteo/chondrosarcoma, and undifferentiated tumors. In contrast, MONC-1 cells expressing ALK-F1174L only produced highly aggressive undifferentiated NC cell-derived tumors, similarly to JoMa1 cells overexpressing ALK-wt, or activating ALK mutants. JoMa1-ALK-derived tumors expressed high levels of various stem cells (SC) and NC stem cell (NCSC) associated markers, confirming their stem-like and phenotypes, and suggesting an ALK-mediated impairment of NCPC differentiation potential in vivo.The specific objectives of the present project are to investigate the functional role of ALK and its downstream pathways in the control of NCPC differentiation potential and fate, as well as to elucidate the involvement of activated ALK in the maturation of the sympathoadrenal lineage and in NB differentiation. Using ALK-transduced NCPC cell lines described above in combination with specific ALK and ALK signaling pathways inhibitors, we will investigate the influence of activated ALK signaling on NCPC differentiation capacity and fate in vitro. To increase our knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms and transcriptional controllers involved in ALK-mediated blockage of NCPC differentiation in vivo, we plan to investigate the global epigenetic patterns and the expression profiles associated to NB orthotopic tumors-derived from MONC1 cells as compared to undifferentiated tumors-derived from MONC-1-ALK-F cells. The role of putative ALK target genes, Myc and Twist1/2, or of newly identified key transcriptional regulators in the control of NCPC differentiation will be explored by means of specific inhibitors and/or silencing strategies through CRISPR/Cas9. In addition, a special focus will be dedicated to the involvement of ALK deregulated activation in the differentiation and maturation of normal sympathetic neurons and adrenal chromaffin cells, using ALK-mutants knock-in mice, as well as in NB cell differentiation potential using ALK overexpressing NB cell lines. Moreover, clinical NB samples will be examined to identify a possible correlation between ALK expression level and/or localization, and neublastic cell differentiation status within individual tumors.This project will be performed within an established collaborative international team of experts in NC development (Prof. L. Sommer and Dr O. Shakhova), in the molecular genetics of NB (Drs I. Janoueix-Lerosey and G. Schleiermacher), in NB orthotopic modeling (Dr J.-M. Joseph), in NB histopathology (Dr M. Peuchmaur), and in epigenetic regulation of solid tumors (Dr N. Riggi). This study should provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms responsible for dysfunctional NC cell maturation responsible for NB development, and may contribute to the identification of new therapeutic options.

A major question in biology is whether and/or to what extent mature gametes carry information beyond the DNA sequence that is important for the development of offspring. Over recent years, numerous studies involving mammalian systems provided some evidence for inter- and/or transgenerational inheritance of phenotypic traits in response to external environmental cues, such as altered nutrition, chemical pollutants, and endocrine disruptors. Alterations in DNA methylation, composition of small RNAs and/or chromatin states have been implicated in the inheritance of such traits, yet, clear mechanistic insights are rather limiting. To elucidate molecular mechanisms involved in such acquired forms of epigenetic inheritance, we aim to dissect (a) the fundamental mechanisms involved in defining chromatin states in mature gametes in unchallenged conditions, and (b) whether such states are instructive in specifying embryonic development. In this proposal, we focus on the development of male germ cells. Following an almost eight week lasting developmental process millions of highly differentiated haploid spermatozoa are day-to-day generated from, originally, a few spermatogonial stem cells. Upon leaving the spermatogonial stem cell pool, differentiating spermatogonia undergo first multiple rounds of replication and thenceforth enter into meiosis to undergo meiotic recombination and haploidisation. During the following spermiogenesis phase, haploid spermatids dramatically remodel their chromatin structure and undertake a major cellular morphogenesis process resulting in the generation of highly compacted and motile sperm.We and others have previously shown that nucleosomes, the basic building units of chromatin, remain present at specific sequences in mature sperm of mouse and men. Ongoing experiments indicate that H3 proteins in nucleosomes “change their identity” by the exchange of canonical replication dependent H3.1 and H3.2 proteins by a testis specific isoform called H3t as well as by the H3.3 variant histone. H3t is conserved among mammals and harbors a few amino acid substitutions relative to H3.1. H3t deficient animals display major defects in the proliferative differentiating spermatogoia and reduced H3.3 levels cause spermatogenic arrest at different stages, pending on residual levels. In this proposal, we combine mouse transgenesis, molecular genetic, epigenomic, and biochemical approaches to understand the function of the H3t and H3.3 histone variants, and to test the role of specific amino acid residues and their post-translational modifications in male germ cell development. We further focus on the mechanisms underlying global transcriptional silencing occurring at the end of spermatogenesis. We propose to perform proteomic analyses of chromatin isolated from developing spermatids to identify novel factors involved in nuclear condensation and nucleosome eviction versus retention. Finally, we aim to determine the localization of nucleosomes in individual spermatozoa and assess their relevance for intergenerational transmission of epigenetic information.We believe that this research will enhance our understanding of the regulatory role of chromatin in male gamete generation and transmission of epigenetic information to the next generation.

However, an unexplored aspect is the role of core-promoters in regulation and execution of this program. It was recently discovered that thousands of promoters undergo a change in basic rules for transcription start site (TSS) selection between maternal/oocyte and zygotic/somatic transcription, effectively switching from one overlapping promoter architecture to another upon zygotic genome activation. This also implies that there should be a switch in the opposite direction during germline development, but when and how this happens is unknown, along with how it affects genome regulation and organization. Here, we set to investigate TSS usage during mouse PGC differentiation and oogenesis using our low-input methodology for mapping TSSs. Specifically, we aim to: 1) capture the developmental stage and epigenetic context in which the TSS-switching occurs; 2) uncover the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Since we believe that comparative studies are powerful for revealing general rules of animal development, opposed to lineage-specific innovations, we shall take advantage of collaborations to expand the study to zebrafish and Drosophila. Long-term, we expect that our results will provide better understanding of PGCs and gametes and lead to more efficient in vitro specification protocols.

The vast majority of them have not been functionally characterized so far. Involved in cell cycle progression, apoptosis, oncogenic transformation or cell migration, microRNAs may play a major role in cellular stress adaptation. To date, no systematic analysis of their contribution to stress tolerance has been performed. In the present project, the functional role of differentially expressed candidate microRNAs in stress tolerance is investigated in different cancer models from colon, cervix and breast cancer with acquired multi-stage resistance to antineoplastic agents. Thus, we propose the following hypotheses: 1. microRNAs are differentially regulated in malignant cells under stress; 2. microRNAs are key players in drug resistance. To test the first hypothesis, cells will be subjected to different forms of stress including oxidative and DNA oriented stress monitoring the dynamics of microRNA response by differential expression profiling and - in case of microRNA suppression - assessing epigenetic silencing. To test the second hypothesis, the expression of microRNAs is modulated at the cellular level to quantify their impact on stress response (survival, senescence, apoptosis or necrosis), on interaction between microRNA and survival pathways (e.g. PI3K - Akt - mTOR) and on identified microRNA target genes. Finally, proof-of-principle studies in selected models may indicate novel intervention strategies in drug resistant tumours. Previous work from our team has demonstrated the orchestrated response of cancer cells to xenobiotics at the molecular level. In order to assess differentially regulated microRNAs in cancer cells under chronic stress, we tested a multi-stage colon cancer system with increasing degrees of resistance to the antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil. Using microarrays and qPCR, we already validated 9 differentially expressed microRNA candidate molecules. The candidates selected for further investigations are: miR-10b, miR-19a, miR-19b, miR-130a, miR-141, miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, and miR-375. Stress tolerance is a vital function in every living organism. To survive, cancer cells have developed a flexible strategy to cope with stress including immune resistance and therapeutic challenge. This endurance makes cancer cells an exceptionally well suited model to study microRNA as a central regulator of stress tolerance by using three multi-stage models. As resistance to systemic cancer therapy is still the major cause of cancer death, this knowledge should have direct relevance for translational cancer therapy research. Neighbouring fields such as neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases - all associated with cellular stress conditions - may benefit from this project as the regulatory role of microRNAs may well extend to other types of cells under unphysiological conditions.

A major challenge to AHSCT is graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), mediated by alloreactive donor T cells which recognize and damage healthy patient tissues. Current methods to prevent GvHD are unsatisfactory, delaying reconstitution of beneficial donor T cells and increasing infection and disease relapse. The development of strategies to selectively reduce alloreactive T cell responses could improve the outcome of AHSCT. One such strategy is alloanergization, the inactivation of alloreactive donor T cells by allostimulation with co-stimulatory blockade. Alloanergization preserves pathogen-specific T cell responses. In early clinical studies, transplantation of alloanergized HLA-mismatched donor T cells within bone marrow resulted in rapid immune reconstitution, few infections and low rates of GvHD. We have recently shown that the strategy of alloanergization results in the generation of regulatory T cells (Treg) which specifically suppress alloreactive donor T cell responses. We therefore hypothesise that alloanergized donor cells could be used for specific prophylaxis of GvHD after AHSCT. The development of alloanergization as a strategy to generate Treg which prevent GvHD without impairing graft-versus-leukaemia (GvL) effects after AHSCT is the objective of this project. The first aim is to potentiate the generation of allospecific Treg following alloanergization. We will use in vitro assays to determine the effects of epigenetic modulation of FOXP3 expression on the frequency, suppressive function and migratory capacity of Treg generated by alloanergization of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). To broaden the applicability of the approach, we will also modify the strategy for use with HLA-matched unrelated donors using established approaches to augment antigen-presentation. The second aim is to determine if alloanergized cells can prevent human T cells from causing GvHD in vivo. This will be achieved using adoptive transfer of human PBMC with and without alloanergized cells into immunodeficient NOD/SCID/IL2R-/- mice in a xenogeneic model of human T cell-mediated GvHD. Finally, a critical component for successful use of alloanergized human cells to prevent GvHD after AHSCT is the preservation of GvL effects. Our third aim is to enhance donor cell-mediated GvL effects after alloanergization by employing non-haematopoietic antigen-presenting cells to spare tissue-restricted minor histocompatibility antigen-directed T cell responses, and to augment alloreactive donor NK cell responses after alloanergization. This project could lead to development of effective clinical strategies to deliver antigen-specific cellular prophylaxis of GvHD which could improve the outcome of ASCT.

CO frequency is highly variable within genomes and this has a profound effect on patterns of genetic diversity. Importantly, crop species such as barley, wheat and maize have chromosomes with large non-recombining regions that can limit breeding of useful variation. We have discovered narrow (1-2 kb) recombination hotspots in Arabidopsis thaliana, via a novel methodology termed pollen-typing. These hotspots localize to intergenic, nucleosome-free regions in gene promoters, and are flanked by H2A.Z histone variant-containing nucleosomes. To understand hotspot patterns on a genome-wide scale we will implement the LDhat program using genetic polymorphism data from 80 Eurasian A.thaliana accessions. LDhat uses population genetics methods to estimate recombination rates from patterns of linkage disequilibrium between polymorphisms. To validate this map we will experimentally measure recombination rates using pollen-typing for a subset of the most active hotspots. Hotspots vary in the extent to which they are controlled by epigenetic information versus primary DNA sequence. Therefore, we will correlate hotspot locations with chromatin maps, for example nucleosome density, and also test for association with DNA sequence motifs. To experimentally test the role of epigenetic organisation on hotspot activity we will repeat pollen-typing in mutants with altered promoter chromatin structure, for example the H2A.Z deposition mutant arp6. As DNA methylation causes transcriptional silencing we will target this modification to hotspots using small RNAs, to test whether this is also sufficient to silence recombination activity. These experiments will functionally test the importance of chromatin organisation for hotspot recombination. A detailed understanding of hotspot control will allow us to boost, suppress or redistribute recombination during crop breeding.

857	Dr Edmund Crisp	MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology	None	2019-11-01	2020-10-31	NPIF Innovation Fellowship	During replication, DNA is unwound to expose single strands as a template for DNA synthesis. However, the propensity of single stranded DNA to form secondary structures poses a challenge to the smooth progression of the replication fork. Certain sequences are particularly prone to secondary structure formation, for instance G quadruplexes (G4) and triple helix forming DNA (H-DNA). Accumulating evidence suggests these structures form readily during replication in vertebrate cells, but are actively countered by a complex network of enzymes. Over 700,000 sites in the human genome are capable of G4 formation, so these structures pose challenges to replication forks potentially as frequently as naturally occurring DNA damage. Moreover, failure to maintain processive replication at secondary structures is associated with both genetic and epigenetic instability. However, the full range factors that promote secondary structure resolution during vertebrate replication is not known, and the in vivo coordination of existing enzymes and the forms of secondary structures upon which they act is also poorly understood. This project will investigate this area using a combination of RNAseq in mutants of known factors, and which have had secondary structures artificially inserted, as well as techniques that identify the location of R-loops (DNA-RNA hybrid triple helixes that may be formed in association with other secondary structures) to provide a comprehensive view of how these challenging DNA replication impediments occur and how they are handled. This will be ultimately important for understanding the circumstances under which structure-forming DNA sequences contribute to human pathology, for example in inherited syndromes, such as Werner or Bloom syndrome, or in cancer, in which replication stress may lead to widespread dysregulation of gene expression.

The overall aim of the project is to develop an understanding of how histone acetyltransferase complex called MSL/MOF and acetylation of histone H4 lysine 16 (H4K16ac) contributes to enhancer function in neuronal cells and how their dysregulation leads to neurodevelopmental disorders. We will address these questions by A) Identifying active enhancers by genome-wide profiling of H4K16ac, H3K27ac and accessible chromatin in neuronal cells. B) Quantify the activity of identified putative active enhancer classes by performing a massively parallel reporter assay. C) Identifying the target genes of neuronal enhancers by studying the long-range interaction between enhancers and promoters in three-dimensional (3-D) space. D) Investigating whether binding of MSL3 and MOF to enhancers is sufficient to activate target genes. E) Investigating the impact of MSL3 and MOF depletion on chromatin structure and gene expression in neuronal cells. F) Determining the impact of MSL3 and MOF depletion on the neuronal phenotype. These insights will be invaluable in informing prioritization of disease-associated protein-coding and non-coding variants for thorough functional studies and to explore therapeutic opportunities. For example, the effect of some of the mutations leading to altered epigenetic status can be reversed by epigenetic drugs e.g. histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), which are already in clinical trials for cancer therapy.

AGC1 deficiency is an ultra-rare genetic disease leading to a severe encephalopathy in the early childhood. This neurological disease is caused by mutations in the SLC25A12 gene, which encodes the isoform 1 of mitochondrial aspartate/glutamate carrier (AGC1). Patients show arrested psychomotor development, seizures, cerebral atrophy and a global hypomyelination with a marked reduction in N-Acetyl-Aspartate (NAA), a crucial precursor for myelin formation in the brain. No cure is currently available and the molecular mechanisms of the disease are still unclear. We have previously demonstrated an essential role of AGC1 in regulating the proliferation of neuron- and oligodendrocyte-precursor cells, the main brain cell types involved in myelination, as well as in sustaining NAA synthesis, potentially explaining patients’ clinical symptoms. The project aims to clarify the biochemical, molecular and epigenetic mechanisms influencing myelination dysfunction in new and more appropriate cellular models of the disease from mice or from the differentiation of patients’ iPSCs. In these models, we will identify, through molecular and computational biology, transcriptional and epigenetic targets potentially influencing myelination, as well as the altered cytosolic and mitochondrial pathways, through biochemistry and metabolomic approach. Finally, we will demonstrate the validity of identified targets through in vitro proof of concept experiments. This multidisciplinary approach will help to unravel the altered mechanisms leading to dysregulation of myelination in AGC1 deficiency, thus indicating the potential targets to counteract hypomyelination and eventually to develop more appropriate and personalized therapies for AGC1 deficiency patients. Furthermore, considering that AGC1 deficiency shares many clinical features with other rare neurological diseases, including hypomyelination, these targets could be also tested in other similar pathologies.

Novel and efficient therapeutics to treat patient with heart failure have to be developed. Mitochondria are subcellular organelles that produce energy and dynamic organelles that fuse and divide. Dysregulated mitochondrial activity results in generation of free radicals which cause damage to cellular components. We reported that mitochondrial quality control by autophagy is essential for normal cardiac functions (Nat Med 2007). Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) contains bacteria-like unmethylated CpG motifs, which are inflammatogenic. We reported that mtDNA that escapes from autophagy-mediated degradation leads to inflammatory responses in cardiomyocytes and heart failure (Nature 2012). Damaged mitochondria in failing hearts are selectively removed by mitochondria-selective autophagy, mitophagy. Mitophagy is preceded by mitochondrial fission, which divides elongated mitochondria into pieces for autophagy. Although Atg32 is essential for mitophagy in yeast, no homologue has been known in mammals. Recently, we identified Bcl2-like protein 13 (Bcl2-L-13) as a functional mammalian homologue of Atg32 which induces mitochondrial fragmentation and mitophagy (Nat Commun in press) in mammalian cells. While methylation of nuclear DNA involves in epigenetic regulation of protein synthesis, the significance of mtDNA methylation in transcription and autophagy-medicated inflammation remains to be elucidated. Our pilot study showed an isoform of DNA methyltransferase targets to mitochondria for mtDNA methylation. In this proposal, we shall attempt to characterize regulation mechanism of Bcl2-L-13 and its in vivo function and to elucidate the physiological significance of mtDNA methylation. Furthermore, we shall elucidate the role of mtDNA methylation and Bcl2-L-13 in the genesis of heart failure and examine whether these will be the therapeutic targets for the treatment of heart failure.

Weaver syndrome has been recently associated with the genetic defect in a protein, called EZH2, that chemically modifies one of the proteins around which DNA is wrapped within our cells. This protein is called Histone H3, and its modification by EZH2 is important in controlling how genes are expressed during development. However, while much is known about the function of EZH2 in orchestrating development, there is no understanding of how the genetic defect found in Weaver syndrome patients brings about the cardinal manifestations associated to the disease. In particular the role of EZH2 in the function of mature neurons, ie. once the cerebral cortex has completed its development, remains unclear. The aim of our project is to define how the genetic defect of Weaver syndrome causes malfunction or abnormal development of cortical neurons, in order to shed light on the mechanisms responsible for cognitive impairment in Weaver syndrome patients. To this end we use a very innovative technological approach to fill the gap between what is known on the function of EZH2 and the clinical manifestations of this disease. Specifically, we use fibroblasts from small skin biopsies, provided by Weaver syndrome patients, and we reprogram them into pluripotent stem cells which can then be differentiated, in vitro, into cortical neurons. We will perform on these patient-specific cells a wide range of advanced molecular analyses to define what are the key genes whose function is altered as a result of the genetic defects in EZH2. Furthermore, the characterization of pluripotent stem cells from Weaver patients will become an important tool for the Weaver syndrome research community, since these cells can be used to study the effect of Weaver mutations on the full range of cell types involved in the clinical manifestations of the disease.

Nuclear transcription complexes function as large multiprotein assemblies and are often composed of functional modules. The regulated decision-making that exists in cells governing the assembly and the allocation of factors to different transcription complexes to regulate distinct gene expression pathways is not yet understood. To tackle this fundamental question, we will systematically analyse the regulated biogenesis of transcription complexes from their sites of translation in the cytoplasm, through their assembly intermediates and nuclear import, to their site of action in the nucleus. The project will have four main Aims to decipher the biogenesis of transcription complexes: I) Investigate their co-translation-driven assembly II) Determine their cytoplasmic intermediates and factors required for their assembly pathways III) Uncover their nuclear import IV) Understand at the single molecule level their nuclear assembly, dynamics and action at target genes To carry out these aims we propose a combination of multidisciplinary and cutting edge approaches, out of which some of them will be high-risk taking, while others will utilize methods routinely run by the group. The project builds on several complementary expertise and knowledge either already existing in the group or that will be implemented during the project. At the end of the proposed project we will obtain novel results extensively describing the different steps of the regulatory mechanisms that control the assembly and the consequent gene regulatory function of transcription complexes. Thus, we anticipate that the results of our research will have a major impact on the field and will lead to a new paradigm for contemporary metazoan transcription.

The cmyc product (Myc) is a transcription factor that binds thousands of genomic loci. However, the identity of the Myc-target genes that influence tumor development, as well as the mechanisms through which Myc acts on these genes, remain most elusive questions in the field. We will use next-generation DNA sequencing to create a multi-layered set of genome-wide profiles. We will analyze cultured mouse cells and developing tumors, the latter in a transgenic model of Myc-induced lymphoma. The profiles will include (i.) quantitative mapping of the RNA transcriptome (coding, non-coding and small RNAs), (ii.) protein-DNA interaction profiles, (iii.) epigenome profiling, (iv.) 3D-folding of genomic DNA, (v.) mutational analysis. These datasets will provide broad views and will answer pointed questions about the action of Myc. We will address the hypothesis that many Myc target genes may not be regulated at the level of net mRNA accumulation, but rather of co-transcriptional processing events. We will provide maps for the RNA-Polymerase II complex, transcriptional co-factors and histone-modifying enzymes. We will whether the Myc-binding sites that do not map within promoters may act as enhancers and/or replication origins. We will address the hypothesis that Myc contributes to reprogramming of the genome independently from its localized effects on target genes. We will also ask which genes are targets of mutations and/or epigenetic silencing in Myc-induced lymphoma. High-throughput functional genomics will be used to address which genes suppress or promote Myc-induced lymphoma. Altogether, our data will provide an unprecedented level of insight into Myc function and into the early stages of tumor progression.	European Research Council	Advanced Grant	2494000.0	EUR

Cancer is caused by changes to either the structure or activity of key genes that regulate how the cells operate, divide and die. One way that cells control the activity of genes is to add specific chemical groups or ?tags' on to the genes or the proteins which act as scaffolding for the genes to ensure they are held in the right shape and can work correctly. The addition of tags can lead to an increase or decrease in gene activity. This often happens incorrectly in cancers and the change in gene activity drives the cell to grow and divide in an uncontrolled manner, forming a tumour. Professor Schär is using his grant from AICR to investigate a type of tagging called methylation and how too much methylation can lead to the cell becoming cancerous.

However, 20-35% of sequence variants identified are classified as a variant of unknown clinical significance". Current research uses genetic pathological molecular and bioinformatic analyses to classify variants as pathogenic or neutral. We have shown that breast tumours with pathogenic BRCA1 mutations have distinct DNA methylation profiles compared to BRCA1 wild-type tumours. Our aim is to assess the DNA methylation of breast tumours that contain BRCA1 missense variants of unknown pathogenicity. We will evaluate the predictive capacity of methylation information and estimate likelihoods that can be incorporated in multifactorial models used for variant classification. This research will contribute to the evaluation of unclassified variants and will provide a direct clinical outcome with improved genetic counselling for women from high-risk families.

However, the mechanism by which WBC DNA methylation associates with risk is currently unknown, but may include an accumulation of cancer risk exposures over a lifetime. ii) Aims: In this proposal we aim to perform further Epigenome-Wide Association Studies (EWAS) for important breast cancer risk exposures to gain further understanding into the mechanisms driving the epigenetic variation associated with breast cancer risk. We aim to focus on one specific risk exposure: lifetime oestrogen exposure and various factors that influence this. iii) Techniques and methodology. Using existing data on WBC DNA from >2500 female subjects from an international consortium, we will perform biostatistical analysis and modelling of DNA methylation markers associated with lifetime oestrogen exposure. A subset of these subjects will include breast cancer case-control subjects in which we will investigate the interaction with cancer risk. We will validate the association between methylation and estrogen exposure by using bisulphite pyrosequencing of 10 candidate genes in a random selection of women (n=1200 subjects) nested within EPIC-Italy, and aim to use biostatistical methods to identify potential modifiers (lifestyle and environmental factors) of estrogen exposure in all women enrolled in EPIC-Italy (n=18,500 subjects). iv) Impact on breast cancer research. If successful this would greatly improve our ability to measure lifetime oestrogen exposures and estimate an individual’s risk associated with this exposure. Furthermore, if we can identify environmental or lifestyle factors that modify the epigenetic signature associated with this risk exposure, we may identify novel methods of prevention and risk reduction.

Castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a significant clinical problem with no effective therapies. In order to develop novel therapies, the mechanism underlying CRPC must be investigated. The androgen receptor (AR) is consistently demonstrated to be a key molecule in the development of castrate resistant disease. There are a number of mechanisms by which this occurs, for example the AR can be amplified enabling activation by lower androgen levels in the body or mutated to generate a promiscuous receptor. I propose that indirectly targeting the AR with therapies directed at co-activator proteins may be an effective way to treat CRPC. To test this hypothesis, an in depth study will be carried out to determine the role of epigenetic AR regulators in CRPC. Specifically, genes and pathways regulated by epigenetic modulation of AR signalling will be identified, how they regulate clinically relevant AR mutants, how the modulators themselves are regulated and what signalling pathways influence AR activity in CRPC. As an example, KMT5A, a lysine mono-methyltransferase, which functions as an AR repressor in a model of androgen dependent disease (LNCaP) and an AR co-activator in models of castrate resistance will be investigated as a therapeutic target for CRPC.

My aim is to develop an analysis method that combines rare disease and population level genetic data to identify genetic loci implicated in red cell disorders. My proposal exploits the genetic principle that genes with rare variants that have a large functional effect and result in ‘disease’ can also contain common population variants with a smaller effect size. These common variants can still result in detectable differences in clinical or laboratory phenotypes. I will test the hypothesis that genes linked to changes in blood red cells in large scale population genetic studies (GWAS) can be used to help select causal genes changes in patients with rare red cell disorders. I have three main objectives: 1. To identify lists of potential candidate genes for rare red cell disorders, from provisional results returned to Genomic Medicine Centres (GMCs) for patients recruited to the 100,000 Genomes Project. 2. To develop a novel algorithm to combine existing GWAS and epigenetic data from the UK Biobank, INTERVAL study and Blueprint Consortium to identify genes linked to population variation in red cell traits, and compare these to the candidate gene lists in patients with rare red cell disorders genes to select a short list of novel candidate genes. 3. To test the effectiveness of this selection strategy by experimentally modelling whether inactivation of the shortlisted genes affects red cell formation in the zebrafish model. This research is important as it aims to provide a new analysis strategy for identifying causal genetic variants in clinical practice.	The Academy of Medical Sciences	None	28607.0	GBP

Heterogeneity within hematopoietic progenitor populations has considerably limited characterization and molecular understanding of lineage commitment in both health and disease. Advances in single-cell genomic technologies provide an extraordinary opportunity for unbiased and high resolution mapping of biological function and regulation. Recently we have developed an experimental and analytical method, termed massively parallel single-cell RNA-Seq (MARS-Seq), for unbiased classification of individual cells from their native context and successfully applied it for characterization of immune and hematopoietic progenitors. Here, we propose to uncover the hierarchy and regulatory mechanisms controlling hematopoiesis by combining comprehensive single-cell RNA-Seq analyses, modelling approaches, advanced functional assays, single-cell CRISPR screens, knockout models and epigenetic profiling. Exciting preliminary result show that indeed our approach is starting to uncover the complexity of hematopoietic progenitors and the regulatory circuits driving hematopoietic decisions. We will pursue the following aims: (i) Generate a refined model of hematopoiesis by comprehensive single-cell RNA-Seq profiling of hematopoietic progenitors, (ii) validate the predicted model by in vivo functional developmental assays and then (iii) test candidate transcription and chromatin factors uncovered by our model for their role in controlling progression towards various lineages using single-cell measurements combined with CRISPR screens. Together, our study is expected to generate a revised and high-resolution hematopoietic model and decipher the regulatory networks that control hematopoiesis. Our methods and models may provide a platform for future medical advancements including a large-scale European collaborative project to discover a comprehensive human hematopoietic tree.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection causes >1.5 million deaths annually and as an obligate pathogen, spread of infection occurs as a result of disease. Striking evolutionary conservation of Mtb-targeting T cell epitopes strongly suggests that T cell responses provide a selection advantage to Mtb by promoting immunopathology and its onward transmission. I have previously used the human tuberculin skin test (TST) in vivo challenge model to demonstrate enrichment of Th17, but not Th1, cells and biological activity in active TB compared to patients with fully treated or latent TB. This was associated with increased neutrophil recruitment and matrix metalloproteinase expression, consistent with a tissue damaging response. Elevated Th17 responses were not evident in blood in active TB, but in the TST were correlated with the expression of monocyte-derived cytokines which drive Th17 differentiation. As T cell recruitment is accompanied by monocytes, I hypothesise that monocytes can be epigenetically reconditioned in active TB to promote Th17 differentiation at the site of disease, a model of trained immunity recently suggested following mouse BCG vaccination. I will compare epigenetic and transcriptional response profiles in monocytes from patients with active and latent TB. I will focus on differential transcriptional responses in monocytes from active TB patients involved in Th17 differentiation, and relate them to the epigenetic profiles of these genes, thereby generating a putative model for the over-representation of Th17 immune responses in active TB.

872	Dr. Martha KÖRNER	University of Edinburgh	None	2012-07-01	2014-06-30	Functional annotation of orphan CpG island transcripts	CpG islands (CGIs) in the vertebrate genome are CpG-rich and GC-rich regions of approximately 1kb in size and, in contrast to the bulk genome, mostly lack DNA methylation. In mice and humans, CGIs co-localise with the majority of the transcription start sites of annotated genes. However, a significant fraction of CGIs maps to intergenic or intragenic regions and due to their lack of association with an annotated transcript are termed ‘orphan CGIs’. Their frequent conservation indicates that they play an important role in genome regulation and they have been postulated to act as promoters for non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). With the emergence of unbiased transcriptome analysis tools such as whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-Seq) it has been uncovered that the majority of the non-ribosomal transcriptome consists of ncRNAs. Thousands of ncRNAs have been described in the recent years, but most of them lack further experimental characterization and functional analysis. The few described functional ncRNAs act in numerous cellular pathways, with a majority playing crucial roles in regulating gene expression. In the first phase of the proposed research project I will generate a comprehensive overview of the orphan CGI transcriptome. A murine neuronal embryonic stem cell differentiation system representing various stages of development will be used to generate transcriptome sets by strand-specific RNA-Seq. The transcription start sites of novel transcripts will be compared with orphan CGIs to identify transcripts originating from an orphan CGI. Those transcripts will be further characterized, applying bioinformatic, biochemical and molecular biological tools. Functional analysis of a candidate set will involve genetic knockouts of the orphan CGI promoters and knockdowns of the novel transcripts. The effects of those genetic manipulations will be initially analysed using the neuronal embryonic stem cell differentiation system and finally in vivo by generating knockout and knockdown animals. Phenotypic analysis will involve genome-wide expression analysis and characterization of associated epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and chromatin modifications to elucidate the functional roles played by orphan CGI transcripts.

Significance: Many childhood cancers exhibit widespread epigenetic aberrations, including changes in DNA methylation and in histone marks. This is in stark contrast to their low frequency of genetic defects, and it suggests an important functional role for epigenome deregulation in these cancers. I have recently described massive changes in histone acetylation and genome-wide enhancer reprogramming for Ewing sarcoma, a difficult-to-treat pediatric tumor. In this project, I will investigate the hypothesis that Ewing sarcoma is an enhancer disease, characterized by highly orchestrated reprogramming of genome-wide histone acetylation patterns. This work will advance our understanding of Ewing sarcoma and of the epigenome’s role in pediatric cancers. It may also provide a molecular basis for pursuing epigenome editing and enhancer targeting and as new therapeutic strategies for Ewing sarcoma. Innovation: The proposed project focuses on a largely unexplored area of Ewing sarcoma research. Using the latest epigenome mapping technology, it will be possible to map and classify all enhancers that are driven by the oncogenic fusion protein EWS-FLI1. Furthermore, chromatin 3D mapping and bioinformatic analysis will connect the enhancers to their target genes genome-wide, and selected enhancer-gene links will be validated by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. I will also confirm the role of Ewing sarcoma specific enhancers in primary samples, using a cohort of 141 Ewing tumors for which I have already completed genome-wide DNA methylation sequencing. Approach: Aim 1. EWS-FLI1-driven enhancer landscape: Comprehensive mapping and integrative analysis of histone acetylation patterns and enhancer binding proteins in cells with tunable EWS-FLI1 expression Aim 2. Regulatory impact of EWS-FLI1-driven enhancers: Connecting Ewing sarcoma specific enhancers to their target genes via chromatin 3D structure mapping, CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, and enhancer RNA knockdown Aim 3. Enhancer activity in clinical samples: Correlating EWS-FLI1 driven enhancer activity to patient-specific gene expression profiles and clinical outcome in primary Ewing sarcoma tumors Environment: This project will be conducted in the laboratory of Prof. Heinrich Kovar at the St. Anna Children’s Cancer Research Institute (CCRI) in Vienna. The CCRI is Austria’s leading center for research on pediatric cancers and affiliated with the Medical University of Vienna. I will also collaborate with leading scientists in France (Olivier Delattre, Curie Institute), Austria (Christoph Bock & Keiryn Bennett, CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine) and the UK (Stephan Beck, University College London). Alignment with Funding Strategy: The proposed project addresses all goals of the Elise Richter Program: (i) it fosters career development of a qualified female scientist in Austria; (ii) the research program will establish the candidate’s scientific independence; (iii) the candidate provides a concrete career plan for becoming a principal investigator; (iv) the candidate pursues habilitation as the formal qualification for assistant professors in Austria.

Aim: • Investigate the anti-apoptotic effects of the differentially methylated gene in dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), FAIM2 (Fas apoptosis inhibitory molecule 2), in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Experimental objectives: • Investigate promoter activity of the locus of differential DNA methylation within FAIM2; • Characterise expression of FAIM2 and proteins involved in Fas-mediated apoptosis in RPE cells exposed to different environmental stress stimuli; • Characterise cellular functional effects of FAIM2 siRNA-mediated knockdown in RPE cells. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible central vision loss in the UK. Early and intermediate dry AMD is the most common form of the disease, no treatment is available. The RPE is the primary site of AMD pathogenesis. AMD is a multifactorial disease with a well-characterised genetic component. Epigenetic changes may also modulate disease risk. I investigated DNA methylation changes in RPE/choroid tissue from donors with dry AMD and found significant changes in the promoter region of FAIM2. FAIM2 is described as a stress-induced intrinsic neuroprotective factor in photoreceptor apoptosis. FAIM2 demonstrates clear transcriptional changes in a recently published AMD transcriptomic study. Furthermore, reduced FAIM2 expression has been shown to increase expression of pro-death genes FAS and RIPK1 in the retina under physiologic conditions, but has not been studied in the RPE. Given the important potential role of FAIM2 in cell survival and viability of RPE cells, this proposal aims to investigate the anti-apoptotic effects of the differentially methylated gene in dry AMD FAIM2 in RPE.

These mechanisms leave measurable marks on the genome, including DNA methylation, spatial patterns of nucleosomes and histone modifications. Hundreds of proteins are implicated in writing and reading these complex, dynamic patterns. While many writers are essential, loss-of-function experiments have, paradoxically, shown little effect on the corresponding marks or gene expression, suggesting a high degree of redundancy. To understand individual epigenetic components, their interactions and their impact on gene expression, wet-lab experiments need to be complemented by sophisticated machine learning (ML) efforts, which offer a unique way of extracting signals from high-dimensional, redundant data. We propose building dedicated ML tools that will have a wide range of applications in epigenetic research. Individual epigenomic marks are readily recorded using e.g. ChIP-Seq, providing static snapshots of epigenomic states. These data exhibit high-order spatial patterns as neighboring nucleosomes interact. Previously, I’ve developed ML tools to compare epigenetic signatures across different conditions / cell types. However cross-talk between writers and readers leads to correlations between individual marks, epigenetic signatures and gene expression, raising questions about their causal relationships. Aimung for a mechanistic understanding of these signatures, we will develop computational tools based on Kernel methods and the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion to find gene-specific epigenetic association networks and to relate them to gene expression. Then, multivariate spatio-temporal models of epigenomic time-series data will allow us to interpret the complex, potentially causal relationships between epigenomic changes and gene expression.

Bentley’s research on Bangladeshi migrants to the UK has shown that women who spent their childhood in the UK have higher scores on indicators of reproductive functioning (including earlier age of menarche, larger ovarian reserve, higher salivary progesterone levels, higher ovulation rates, later age of menopause) than those that have migrated to the UK after age 8. At the time Bentley proposed that this variation in reproductive functioning might be due to differences exposure to infectious diseases in childhood. Melamed's research group is using a mouse model to further understand these human data. She has conducted a pilot study in mice to see whether exposure to an artificial immune stressor causes similar changes in reproductive functioning in mice. Indeed, amongst other findings these preliminary data show that mice experience a puberty delay of six days after being exposed to a stressor during early life. A reduction in Srd5a1 mRNA levels was found only in the hypothalami and ovaries, but not other tissues, of mice who experienced early life stress. Considering the known effect of neuroactive steroids on the GnRH secretory system, these findings led to the hypothesis that Srd5a1 has a role in delaying puberty onset after early life stress. My research aim: Within this collaboration I will seek to understand the role of 5-alpha-reductase in the onset of puberty by investigating the effect of different stressors on the gene expression of Srd5a1. Methods: I will use the GnRH neuronal cell line (GT1-7) to investigate the regulation of Srd5a1 expression during normal or stress conditions in GnRH-neurons. I will treat cells with various steroids, ILs or component to activate different signalling pathway and then measure the mRNA levels of Srd5a1. To consequently measure these levels I will performa a RNA extraction from the cells using TRIsol reagent, and then perform a reverse transcription followed by qPCR to quantify the RNA levels. I will also look at epigenetic modifications, including CpG methylations and histone modifications, in the Srd5a1 gene after the various treatments. To asses whether neuroactive steroids such as THDOC, allopregnenolone and 3a-androstanediol are found in reduced levels in vivo, these steroids will be measured in brain samples of 5 DSS-treated and 5 control mice. After harvesting the brains and homogenising them with a 1:1 water/methanol mixture liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) (West Coast Metabolomic Center) or GC-MS (ZRT laboratory) will be conducted. Implications: I will be able to integrate my findings from this project into the wider literature of human reproductive ecology and life history theory as differential expression of Srd5a1 in response to early life stressors might be key to explaining differences in menarcheal age across human societies. This research project therefore has great potential to make new contributions to the understanding the plasticity of human health and physiology.

877	Anna Groner	Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Department of Medical Oncology	Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Department of Medical Oncology	2014-02-01	2015-01-31	The role of TRIM24 as a hormone-independent transcriptional co-activator of the androgen receptor in castration-resistant prostate cancer	I propose to study the involvement of the transcriptional co-activator TRIM24 in prostate cancer (PC) progression. The steroid hormone androgen drives PC growth by activating the androgen receptor (AR), which in turn acts as a transcription factor regulating genes important for cancer growth. Advanced cancer therapy aims at blocking this signaling axis with anti-androgens and by reducing levels of serum androgen. While PC initially responds to androgen-ablation, most tumors progress to a castration-resistant (CR) state, which currently has a low overall survival rate and is the main reason for prostate cancer morbidity. Therefore, improved and novel therapies need to be developed for CRPC. One idea includes targeting of critical transcriptional co-regulators that allow AR gene transactivation in the absence of androgens. During my fellowship, I propose to study the involvement of the transcriptional co-regulator and epigenetic reader protein TRIM24 in the process of hormone-independent AR activation and prostate cancer progression. My preliminary data suggest that TRIM24 is overexpressed in different states of PC, particularly CRPC. Moreover, TRIM24 is required for both the androgen-dependent and -independent growth of prostate cancer cell lines. This is further consistent with my findings that TRIM24 and AR can physically interact in both conditions and can co-activate a subset of genes important for CRPC growth. Based on this background, my proposal has two major aims. (i) By elucidating the genome-wide binding profiles of TRIM24- and AR-regulated genes, I hope to identify if the concerted actions of TRIM24 and AR drive the overexpression of CRPC genes. (ii) By studying the hormone-independent interaction between TRIM24 and AR and by assessing its functional role in CRPC growth, I will identify the therapeutic potential of targeting this interaction in CRPC. Finally, my work will help establish if TRIM24 acts as a hormone-independent co-activator of AR at selective genes important for the growth of CRPC. This study will not only shed light on the molecular role of endogenous TRIM24, but also harbors biomedical importance, because the results should directly drive the development of future CRPC treatments.

Characterizations of the molecular mechanisms involved in this process are of utmost medical importance, because they may identify targets for CRPC treatment, which currently has no curative therapy available. Our preliminary data suggest that TRIM24 has a unique role in supporting CRPC growth. We will also identify the molecular targets of TRIM24 in CRPC by using androgen-dependent and CRPC model cell lines. Integration of these targets with gene expression datasets from prostate cancer patients will determine how TRIM24 drives CRPC growth. Our main hypothesis is that TRIM24 directly anchors AR at novel gene targets in CRPC and thereby mediates its ligand-independent transactivation and growth. However, by determining TRIM24-mediated gene expression programs in CRPC in an unbiased and genome-wide manner, we do not limit ourselves to this model, allowing us to identify other critical pathways involved in prostate cancer progression. We hope that this molecular characterization will help us deepen our understanding of disease progression and will shed light on new potential therapeutic targets in CRPC.

Most tumors depend on the steroid hormone androgen for growth. Therefore, endocrine therapies either based on androgen antagonists or through androgen deprivation, have been developed as targeted strategies in advanced disease. These approaches have been highly successful and prolong PC patient survival, but they are not curative. While treatment usually induces initial PC remission, most tumors relapse and progress to endocrine therapy-resistant or “castration-resistant PC” (CRPC) upon prolonged exposure. I am proposing to investigate molecular epigenetic mechanisms regulating the interplay between transcription factor recruitment and chromatin structure, that can be targeted to inhibit essential transcriptional programs in CRPC, potentially resulting in the development of novel treatments for this stage of disease.On a molecular level, androgen activates the androgen receptor (AR) transcription factor, which in turn drives oncogenic gene expression programs in PC cells. Androgen blockade by endocrine therapy strongly decreases these pro-proliferative programs, and halts tumor growth. Seemingly paradoxical, CRPC, which is resistant to endocrine therapy, still depends on sustained transcriptional activation by AR, even in the absence of hormone stimulation. How the genomic function of AR is “reprogrammed” in CRPC cells and how this can be targeted for epigenetic therapies will be addressed through experiments described in this proposal. I will assess if the histone acetyl-lysine (H3K23ac) reader TRIM24 regulates oncogenic transcriptional programs in CRPC by anchoring AR to the genome, and will establish if this interaction can be targeted to block AR function with TRIM24 selective inhibitors. The proposal has two major aims:Aim 1. Identify AR-dependent transcriptional programs regulated by the interaction between H3K23ac and TRIM24 in PC cells. Generating a TRIM24-dependent and CRPC-specific AR transcriptional signature in cells and using it to query PC patient gene expression will establish if disrupting the interaction between TRIM24 and chromatin is a therapeutic option to block AR function in CRPC.Aim 2. Assess if the interaction between TRIM24 and H3K23ac during mitosis contributes to the stable inheritance of AR-dependent gene expression programs in CRPC cells. Exploring the TRIM24-H3K23ac interaction on mitotic chromosomes may explain how reprogrammed AR is stably targeted to novel sites in proliferating CRPC cells. Results from these mechanistic studies will establish (i) how the epigenetic reader function of TRIM24 contributes to AR-driven oncogenic transcriptional programs in CRPC cells and (ii) how blocking this function can be translated into developing new therapeutic strategies for CRPC patients.

In such cases, prognosis have not improved over the last dec-ades and outcome is still unacceptably low. Only a limited number of studies directly address this prob-lem, mainly because in vivo model systems to mimic recurrences and identify novel drug sensitivities are lacking. One additional problem specific to pediatric malignancies is the paucity of actionable mutations that can be identified both from diagnostic as well as relapse samples. Hence, existing recurrent genetic abnormalities such as translocation events gain additional weight and we can hypothesize that other mechanisms such as epigenetic transcriptional control might play a major role in disease development. To specifically address these topics, we suggest in this proposal to take advantage of our novel insights that have recently been obtained during the current funding period. We are also proud that we are now part of a very large European initiative which will allow us to substantially expand our collection of pa-tient-derived xenografts and which will be used in most of the proposed projects. To gain novel insights into development and treatment of recurrent disease, we will address the following specific aims: Aim 1: To establish a personalized drug screening platform and identify novel treatment vulnerabilities directly in patient derived primary cell cultures. We hypothesize that new sequencing efforts of recurrent samples have to be supplemented with functional drug screens to advance treatment of relapsed patients. In addition, our platform serves as discovery tool to identify novel mechanisms of drug resistances and novel biomarkers for patient selection.Aim 2: To further validate CHD4 as major drug target in pediatric malignancies and describe the epi-genetic landscape of fusion positive-RMS tumors in general. We hypothesize that CHD4, a newly iden-tified crucial co-factor of the RMS specific fusion protein PAX3-FOXO1, has a more widespread function as epigenetic reader than previously appreciated. In addition, we will use unbiased large scale screens to identify novel epigenetic vulnerabilities in RMS tumors.Aim 3: To identify novel (chemo)resistance mechanisms directly in patient derived tumor material and develop novel rational combinatorial treatment strategies. Using both unbiased in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 drop-out screens and a hypothesis driven approach investigating the contribution of hedgehog signaling, and by comparing diagnostic versus relapse samples from the same patients, we will identify resistance mechanisms that will guide combinatorial drug development, aiming at re-sensitizing tumors that are resistant to commonly applies chemotherapeutics. We expect that this follow-up proposal will provide relevant novel insights into RMS biology and pro-gression by working directly with patient material and will contribute novel pre-clinical information to guide development of targeted therapies into early phase I/II clinical protocols.

881	Nicolo Riggi	University of Lausanne	Département Médico-chirurgical de Pédiatrie CHUV	2015-05-01	2019-04-30	Identification of the epigenetic determinants of cellular transformation and heterogeneity in pediatric tumors.	Large scale sequencing studies have implicated increasing numbers of transcription factors (TFs), chromatin modifiers and histones as direct targets of mutations and rearrangements in cancer. These genetic alterations are now recognized to play critical roles in cellular transformation by altering key transcriptional programs involved in cellular differentiation, plasticity and proliferation. The detailed characterization of these alterations requires the coordinated analysis of aberrant transcriptional regulators and their effects at large numbers of sites across the genome. This task can be facilitated by two recent developments: the use of chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing to map protein-DNA interactions (ChIP-seq) and the definition of a ‘histone code’ of post-translational histone modifications associated with the activation state of regulatory elements. This combination allow the comprehensive identification of the chromatin landscape (‘epigenome’) of a given cell type across the genome. Signature chromatin structures can then be used to identify promoters, transcripts, enhancers, silencers and repressive chromatin domains. They also inform on the regulatory state assumed by a given DNA element in a specific cell type or developmental state. These advances have been particularly important for the genome-wide identification of enhancer elements, revealing their primordial role for a large number of regulatory events in transcription and their strong link to cell identity. Similar approaches based on the analysis of chromatin marks on a genome-wide scale have great potential for elucidating the contributions of altered transcriptional regulation to cancer. The impact of such epigenetic changes in cancer may be particularly relevant in two functional contexts: the establishment and maintenance of intratumoral cellular heterogeneity and hierarchy, and the identification of the regulatory network driving tumor initiation and progression by single genetic oncogenic events.The presence of an intratumoral hierarchy governing cellular differentiation and tumor initiating potential, as well as the associated epigenetic mechanisms are increasingly appreciated to play key roles in at least a subset of cancer types. Haematopoietic malignancies as well as a growing number of solid tumors have been now shown to contain a subpopulation of cells possessing tumor initiating capability and stem cell properties, including expression of embryonic stem cell genes and self-renewal potential. These cells, termed cancer stem cells (CSC), are generally believed to represent the tumor re-populating force, preserving their own numbers through self-renewal, and generating a more differentiated progeny that composes the bulk of the tumor. In addition to providing a driving force for tumor growth and maintenance, CSC may be more resistant to conventional anti-cancer therapy, consistent with their presumed role in relapse following therapy. Accordingly, CSC transcriptional signatures are highly predictive of overall patient survival supporting their clinical relevance. It follows that attempts to increase therapeutic effectiveness in tumors with a documented cellular hierarchy should include strategies that target not only rapidly dividing bulk and progenitor cells, but CSC as well. Since CSC share the same genetic alterations with the more differentiated cancer cells to which they give rise, it is believed that their defining properties are rooted in their epigenetic state. In keeping with this, a better understanding of the regulatory circuitries sustaining CSC-specific transcriptional programs and plasticity within primary tumors is a critical goal with broad implications for therapy.Some types of cancer, including a subset of pediatric sarcomas, can display only a single detectable oncogenic event, usually in the form of a non-random reciprocal chromosomal translocation. Chromosomal translocations that constitute a phenotypic signature of defined tumor types commonly generate a functional fusion gene believed to initiate tumor development. The majority of genes involved in chromosomal translocations encode transcription factors and transcriptional regulators, not surprisingly then, the resulting fusion protein behave as aberrant transcription factors that drive transformation by altering the gene expression repertoire of permissive precursor cells. For transformation and subsequent tumor initiation to occur, the corresponding fusion protein should be able to generate the appropriate epigenetic landscape either by exploiting a primary cellular microenvironment that is permissive for expression of its oncogenic properties or by an initial transcriptional reprogramming of primary target cells to render them permissive for its subsequent transforming activity. The study of malignancies that appear to harbor a single initiating oncogenic event therefore offers a particularly attractive means to address the possible mechanisms whereby an single driver oncogenic event can induce tumor development through reprogramming of the transcriptional landscape of primary cells. This notion is particularly evident in pediatric cancers, where specific genetic alterations may represent the sole event in tumor initiation. Pediatric tumors present therefore unique opportunities to characterize the transcriptional impact of oncogenic lesions in relative isolation from the complex genomic aberrations typical of adult malignancies.During the past 3 years our group developed a research program focusing on two distinct aspects of epigenetic reprogramming in cancer: the analysis of the transcriptional programs governing cellular hierarchies in primary human tumors, and the molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis and tumor progression driven by single aberrant transcription factors in pediatric sarcomas. In the first approach glioma CSC models were used to identify a core set of neurodevelopmental TFs that are critical for GBM propagation, and sufficient to fully reprogram differentiated GBM cells into ‘induced’ CSCs that recapitulate the epigenetic landscape and phenotype of native CSCs. The second line of investigation allowed us to identify primary cells from which selected sarcomas develop and to make a number of contributions to the field. In particular we have recently characterized the direct mechanisms of action of EWS-FLI1, an aberrant TF driving Ewing sarcoma development. Pursuing the coordinated analysis of chromatin states at EWS-FLI1 binding sites in Ewing sarcoma primary tumors, cell lines and precursor pediatric mesenchymal stem cells we uncovered distinct roles for EWS-FLI1 in enhancer activation and repression, dictated by the underlying DNA sequence and critical to maintain the tumor state. The goal of this research proposal is to pursue these two successful lines of investigation, applying similar experimental approaches to additional relevant cellular and tumor models. In a first set of experiments, using a well-established model of primary CSC from the pediatric tumor neuroblastoma (NB), we plan to identify epigenetic determinants that distinguish CSCs from their differentiated progeny. In a second set of experiments we will take advantage of our previous works on sarcomas to establish the global chromatin landscape of two aggressive childhood malignancies driven by single transforming oncogenic events, and to determine the involvement of epigenetic-mediated gene regulatory mechanisms in tumor initiation and development. These two distinct but complementary approaches should provide a novel view of the molecular pathways driving the emergence and progression of genetically-defined pediatric tumours, and have the potential to offer new therapeutic targets to improve their clinical management.

A cure for diabetes requires the regeneration or replacement of functional ß-cells. Recent work from my group supports the concept of a-to-ß-cell reprogramming as a therapeutic strategy, by demonstrating that a-to-ß-cell conversion is: 1) possible, 2) spontaneous under some conditions, and 3) able to restore glycemic control in diabetic animals. In addition, we also showed that massive a-cell depletion (as the one we could envision if most a-cells were to reprogram to insulin production) does not affect significantly the basal level of glucagonemia.This proposal stems from observations made during the exploration of the influence of ageing on islet cell plasticity. Indeed, the study of the impact of age on the mode and efficiency of ß-cell reconstitution led us to discover a completely unexpected novel and powerful mechanism of heterologous ß-cell regeneration after total ß-cell loss in very young, prepubescent mice. Interestingly, we found that a-cells retain plasticity throughout life, also in aged individuals, and reprogram to produce insulin even late after ß-cell loss. By contrast, ß-cell-depleted prepubescent mice efficiently recover from diabetes in a few months without detectable a-cell conversion: instead, the younglings display massive somatostatin-to-insulin d-cell conversion, involving de-differentiation, replication and re-expression of islet developmental regulators before insulin, in most d-cells.•Objective:During the next 3 years we want to address the following fundamental questions:Why the regenerative response to ß-cell loss is different before and after puberty? Why d- and a-cells, once committed to reprogram into insulin production, utilize such different pathways to replenish the depleted ß-cell population? Why d-cell-derived reconstituted ß-cells do replicate vigorously for a short period, while more mature ß-cells do not enter the cell cycle? •Rationale:The rationale articulating this proposal is organized around 2 main areas:1. Identification of genetic factors and pathways that can promote d-to-ß-cell reprogramming. We will analyze transcriptional and epigenetic changes in d-cells expressing ß-cell-specific transcription factors to identify novel pathways and targets for d-to-ß-cell conversion. 2. Explore why the d-to-ß-cell reprogramming is an age-dependent process. We will further validate d-to-ß-cell reprogramming as a therapeutic strategy by exploring effectiveness in aged as well as young adult animals, and will identify pathways differentially regulated in the two groups.•Outcome:The proposed studies should provide:•Further validation of d-to-ß-cell reprogramming as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of insulin-dependent diabetes•Generation of new animal models for the study of d-to-ß-cell reprogramming•Identification of novel pathways and mechanisms to promote d-to-ß-cell reprogramming through 2 approaches: Gene expression analyses combined with DNA methylation profiling, and through Transcription factor over-expression in d-cells.•Relevance to T1D:In contrast to other strategies to regenerate ß-cells, reprogramming does not require a remaining ß-cell mass and could be applied to patients at all stages of disease. Another advantage of d-cells is that, like a-cells, they are already present in situ (in islets) and share their ontogeny with ß-cells (in contrast to stem cell-based strategies or the exocrine-to-ß-cell conversion approach). There is evidence of efficient ß-cell regeneration early in life in children or rodents with T1D, or after pancreatic damage, such as partial pancreatectomy. Our preliminary observations made in young mice may cause a paradigm-shift in the search of future cell therapies for diabetes. After publication of the observed a-to-ß-cell conversion by us, many scientists around the world are exploring the possibility of exploiting a-cell plasticity as a novel clinical application for treating diabetes.

All cells in our body share the same genetic material, although cells are very different in shape, physiology and developmental history. These different fates are due to differences in genome expression. Although cell fate decisions during development are induced by a number of specifying transcription factors, these can later disappear while cells maintain their fate. This observation led to the hypothesis of the epigenetic landscape restricting fate changes1, and in the past decade various epigenetic pathways were described to be associated with gene expression states2. Indeed, most of the characterized epigenetic determinants create subnuclear domains3, raising the possibility of a crosstalk between genome tridimensional organization inside the nucleus, genome expression and hence cell fate4. To study the impact of nuclear organization on cell fate, we use Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system for its unique traceability of cell lineages5,6, its combination of forward and reverse genetics and well established molecular and cell biology tools. Technically, our research is based on high end microscopy of live and fixed samples, genome-wide molecular mapping techniques and in vivo characterization of protein function. We tackle the question of cell fate and nuclear organization inter-relationship by exploring the effects of epigenetic regulators on cell plasticity over the course of animal development, by exploring the function of subnuclear domains, using C. elegans X chromosome transcriptional regulation as a paradigm, finally identifying proteins functionally organizing the nucleus and sequences sensitive to nuclear localization.

Background: Allergy in a given individual is determined by both environmental as well as genetic pressure. Among the environmental factors, it has been demonstrated that exposure to common pathogens early in life is highly protective. This phenomenon has in particular been observed in children born and raised in Alpine farming households. Among genetic factors, it is suspected that epigenetic changes, i.e. phenomena changing the transcription pattern of genes in absence of genetic mutations, might contribute to the raising prevalence of allergy. Objectives: We aim to establish and characterize a mouse model of allergy prevention by breeding and raising mice in an Alpine barn in the presence of cattle.Experimental design: The immune response of barn mice will be characterized for antibody production as well as T cell-cytokine production, and compared to mice housed in a clean university animal core facility. Subsequently, both groups of mice will be sensitized either systemically, or orally, or through the skin in order to investigate the susceptibility of both groups to allergic reactions. In a second set of experiments, we will explore potential environmentally-induced epigenetic modifications on genes coding for cytokines or receptors involved in allergy modulation. These experiments will also be performed in mice undergoing various back-crosses in housing conditions between the barn and the clean facilities.Significance of the study: Allergies are contributing to the increased morbidity of emerging diseases in the developed world. These sets of experiments will allow establishing a new experimental model for exploring mechanisms as well as identifying potential intervention for allergy prevention.

Epigenetics, the study of heritable changes in gene function occurring without a change in the DNA sequence, is a major new field in life sciences. Drosophila has led the way with work starting almost a century ago with position-effect variegation (PEV), a phenomenon of mosaic expression of genes relocated near heterochromatin by a chromosomal rearrangement. Genetic modifiers of PEV have identified essential components of heterochromatin-induced epigenetic silencing as predicted by Reuter and Spierer (1992). We have molecularly identified a number of modifiers of PEV and devoted a lot of work to one of them SU(VAR)3-7. We have revealed that SU(VAR)3-7 participates with other partners in the building of heterochromatin resulting in gene silencing. We have characterized its function by analysing the phenotypes of Su(var)3-7 mutation and over-expression in soma, dissected the different domains of the protein and described its implication in heterochromatin formation as well as it requirement for proper dosage compensation. We plan to pursue our study of SU(VAR)3-7 function with different partners in different pathways. We will also examine the function of the protein in the gonads, find its genomic targets and its interactors particularly in germ cells. In parallel, we will study methyltransferases responsible of H3K9 methylation, as we have produced essential tools, notably null mutations of dG9a and DmSetDB1 by homologous recombination.Aim 1: Exploring transposable elements as targets of SU(VAR)3-7 in heterochromatin. We have found that SU(VAR)3-7 controls the activity of a number of transposable elements (TEs). We plan to describe the effects of Su(var)3-7 mutations on TEs silencing, and the subsequent effects on their transposition. We plan to unravel the mechanisms of action by examining the expected physical association of the protein on TEs and its possible role controlling this part of the genome potentially detrimental. Finally, we showed genetic interaction between Su(var)3-7 and the small interfering RNAs pathways. It is of importance to study the link between the function of SU(VAR)3-7 and the role of small RNAS in genomic silencing, and the implication of other Su(var) genes in TEs silencing. Aim 2: Exploring the role of SU(VAR)3-7 and its heterochromatic partners in gonads. After a comprehensive analysis of SU(VAR)3-7 physiology in the soma, we plan to describe in details the phenotypes of Su(var)3-7 mutations in gonads, among them an unsumoylable SU(VAR)3-7, notably on chromosome integrity and inheritance, oocyte differentiation, genomic silencing, and regulation of TEs activity. We will expand our study to other factors of the chromatin as the H3K9 HMTase dG9a and DmSETDB1 and other Su(var) genes. Aim 3: Analyzing the function of DmSETDB1. We will describe in details the function of DmSETDB1 in the female gonad and test the effect of its targeting to specific promoters. In parallel, we will study the post-translational ubiquitination of DmSETDB1 and characterize its partners. DmSETD1 appears as an important chromatin regulator, and the work in progress should unravel a comprehensive picture of the mechanisms and targets of silencing.Expected Value. We will demonstrate the importance of several actors of gene silencing in epigenetic control of gene expression, in the regulation of TEs, and in chromosome integrity and segregation at mitosis and meiosis. We want to foster this analysis with a special emphasis on the female gonad. In addition to contributing to the expanding field of epigenetics in biology and human diseases, we expect that our work will bring novel understanding on the so far poorly explored role of epigenetic mechanisms in germline differentiation.

887	Radek Skoda	University of Basel	Departement Biomedizin Universitätsspital Basel	2014-04-01	2017-06-30	Determination of the mutational landscape and clonal architecture and its application in angiogenesis and thrombosis of MPN patients	Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are a group of diseases characterized by aberrant proliferation of the erythroid, megakaryocytic and myeloid lineages. They represent clonal stem cell disorders with an inherent tendency towards leukemic transformation. The frequent occurrence of a somatic mutation in the Janus kinase 2 gene (JAK2-V617F) in patients with MPN has a major impact on diagnosis and therapy of patients with MPN. During the last years several mutations in genes other than JAK2 have been described. Mainly, mutations in genes involved in regulation of the epigenetic machinery, such as TET2, EZH2 and DNTM3A have been reported. These gene mutations are not restricted to MPN, but are also found in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Improvement of sequencing technology, namely the introduction of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has massively increased the sequencing power. This has enabled large genome wide studies as well as targeted sequencing studies in large cohorts of patients that are not feasible with classical capillary DNA sequencing. Thus, a more complete picture of the genetic alterations that are present in the malignant cells can be obtained and the synergy between several mutations in the same patient can be studied. We have established a method to efficiently sequence large number of patients for a specific set up genes using and enrichment based NGS strategy. Using this method to screen for somatic mutations, we will reveal whether patients can be risk stratified based on their mutational status and what mutations might predispose to deregulated angiogenesis and thrombosis. We will provide insight into the role of aberrantly expressed angiogenic factors as well as prothrombogenic genetic and molecular markers and their correlation with the mutational profile of patients with MPN. The project results will contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of MPN and will increasingly become the basis for individual therapeutic decisions in the near future. Besides a great benefit for the general efforts in fighting cancer, networking between Switzerland and Serbian research centers will allow transfer of knowledge and technology between participants, mobility of human resources, education and promotion of young researchers.

888	Radek Skoda	University of Basel	Departement Biomedizin Universitätsspital Basel	2013-06-01	2016-05-31	Genetic analysis of myeloproliferative neoplasms	Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are a group of diseases characterized by aberrant proliferation of the erythroid, megakaryocytic and myeloid lineages. They represent clonal stem cell disorders with an inherent tendency towards leukemic transformation. MPN are subdivided into three disease entities: polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). The report on the frequent occurrence of a somatic mutation in the Janus kinase 2 gene (JAK2-V617F) in patients with MPN has increased our understanding of the pathogenesis, improved the diagnostic workup and allowed developing JAK2 inhibitors for the treatment of late stages of MPN. There is now convincing evidence for the existence of additional mutations that precede the acquisition of JAK2-V617F and that are likely to be involved in initiating the disease in a proportion of MPN patients. These mutations can be either somatic, e.g. in genes that are involved in epigenetic regulation (e.g. EZH2), or germline in families with a predisposition to acquire MPN. In familial MPN, somatic mutations (most frequently JAK2-V617F) are required for initiating MPN. It is not clear yet, whether in sporadic MPN a single somatic event such as JAK2-V617F may be sufficient or if several mutations must collaborate to initiate MPN. We have developed several mouse models that will allow us to address these questions and should clarify the requirements for disease initiation. In addition, we will study the question how different JAK2 mutations that signal through the same kinase domain generate different phenotypes (ET versus PV). We have adapted the new sequencing technologies to define the mutational status of the MPN cells in large cohorts of MPN patients and familial cases. We now have a collection of extensively characterized primary cells to test some of the hypotheses derived from our mouse models and familial MPN studies. The proposed experiments will address the following specific aims:1. To examine correlations between somatic mutations and disease complication and progression in a cohort of MPN patients extensively characterized by next generation sequencing2. To examine the role of critical downstream signaling mediators such as the STAT proteins in ET versus PV phenotype decisions 3. To test the potential synergism between JAK2-V617F and loss of function mutations in EZH2 in disease initiation and progression4. To search for novel disease causing mutations in familial MPNSignificance: The new sequencing technologies allow to characterize large cohorts of patients for mutations in disease related genes. This opens the possibility to stratify patients in risk groups based on their mutational status and improve individualized predictions and therapeutic decisions. The signaling studies can potentially contribute to better understanding why mutations in JAK2 proteins can result in different phenotypes and may also identify interactions that are specific for the mutated JAK2. These could represent targets for specific intervention. The factors and mechanisms influencing disease initiation of MPN are poorly understood. Knowing the initiating events and elucidating the function of collaborating mutations will be important to devise new approached to improve prognosis and ultimately treatment of patients with MPN. These additional mutated genes may constitute new drug targets in MPN.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div. I-III)	643081.96	CHF

One major threat to germline genome integrity is the mobile genetic elements called transposons. Germline-specific Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) act as guardians of the genome by silencing transposable elements. The central aims of this proposal are to study how nuclear small RNAs are made and how they function in recruiting DNA methylation to target transposon loci in mammals. Key nucleases involved in piRNA biogenesis are not known. In this proposal, we will characterize the role of two novel nuclease family members in the piRNA biogenesis pathway using biochemical, structural and mouse genetic tools. It will use catalytic-dead mouse mutants of RNA helicases to trap transiently assembled biogenesis and silencing effector machineries in vivo. Since most piRNAs derive from repeat regions, we employ unique artificial piRNA precursors to systematically study piRNA processing steps in insect cell cultures, transgenic fly and mouse models. The use of RNA-crosslinking and deep sequencing strategies will allow us to unambiguously map factor binding sites to these unique reporters. It will aim to biochemically and functionally characterize mammalian piRNA-guided nuclear silencing complexes (RITS). Using artificial reporters and tethering of factors, it will provide direct and unambiguous evidence linking piRNAs to the epigenetic silencing of transposons by DNA methylation in the mammalian genome. Furthermore, it will explore the transgenerational nature of this silencing. Finally, using Cas9 genome editing tools it will examine the role of a set of unique, non-repeat piRNAs whose functions during mouse germ cell development are unknown. Overall, this proposal aims to use interdisciplinary approaches in uncovering the epigenetic role of nuclear germline small RNAs.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Programmes	1743540.0	CHF

Thus, a considerable percentage of the population living in Switzerland is effected by vitamin D deficiency, in particular during winter months, when endogenous vitamin D production due to sun exposure in insufficient. In our project, we aim at an integrating approach to examine on the one hand whether genetic and epigenetic variability in the population living in Switzerland might contribute to vitamin D status of a particularly vulnerable part of the population, and on the other hand we will investigate possibilities to increase vitamin D levels in foods frequently consumed in Switzerland.Firstly, we will determine vitamin D levels in pregnant women and their offspring (cord blood), which is a particularly vulnurable group of the population and for which no data on vitamin D levels are available in Switzerland. For this group, we will additionally examine whether women with a dark skin colour and their babies have an increased risk of being vitamin D deficient compared with women with a lighter skin colour. Secondly, we will make use of food preferences in Switzerland and explore whether vitamin D content of fermented dairy products can be enriched or fortified with vitamin D.

We seek to engineer tumouroids; 3-dimensional, biomimetic synthetic tumour models containing explanted human cancer tissue so that the cancer can be propagated and then subjected to treatment. We also intend to develop non-invasive monitoring systems that are responsive to cancer colony viability and cell count that can be applied at scale. Our proposal seeks to evaluate both the health and health economic benefit of therapeutic allocation on the basis of demonstrable response in parallel to existing trials. Our proposal is explicitly geared to producing a technology that will influence patient care, by means of its criterion and face validity, its wide availability and reasonable cost. We do however recognise that if this primary goal is not realised that other applications may be both possible and desirable. These include an important role in drug development, furthering our understanding of tumour biology and as a predictive tool that may provide synergies with genomic and epigenetic predictive models of the future. The project plan comprises the following work-streams (WS): WS 1.0 Engineer reproducible, quality controlled, 3-dimensional synthetic constructs that are biomimetic for lung, kidney, colon, and prostate. This work stream is about version and quality control of the tumouroid constructs. We believe our tumouroid to be unique in the extent to which it can be engineered and therefore specified and manufactured. It is a two-compartment model comprising a synthetic cancer mass embedded within a synthetic stroma. Once a reliable platform for each tumour type has been produced it will transition into the next work-stream WS 2.0 Generate cultures from explanted cancer cells derived from biopsy or surgical specimens to create tumouroids of non-small cell lung cancer; renal cancer; colon cancer; and prostate cancer. Validate the responsiveness of the model. This work-stream addresses the refinement and validation of the tumouroids that incorporate human explanted cancer colonies. Key attributes of validity comprise genetic homology relating to original cancer, morphological criteria and responsiveness of tumouroid to challenge (radiotherapeutic and chemotherapeutic). WS 3.0 Bioengineer immune-competence within the tumouroids. Deriving an immunocompetent model of cancer remains a key challenge. This work-stream seeks to establish whether levels of immune competence can be conferred onto tumouroids by inoculating the patient's own tumour infiltrating lymphocytes into the tumouroid. WS 4.0 Engineer tumouroid-monitoring systems for non-invasive assessment of cancer cell viability and dynamics. Another key attribute in relation to making tumouroid-directed care a possibility is the opportunity for accessible, inexpensive non-invasive assessment of colony viability. This work-stream compares a number of approaches. Those that fail to meet the target will be discarded in favour of those that do. WS 5.0 Assess concordance between the treatment-response observed in the patient-derived tumouroids vs that observed in the patient being treated within an established clinical trial. This represents our first phase of clinical evaluation and takes the form of a non-intervention study in which we compare the tumouroid-predicted response to therapy to that observed within a clinical trial setting. WS 6.0 Establish a stakeholder/public engagement programme that has a central role in the conduct of the project. This work-stream was the first to initiate and will run alongside the project. WS 7.0 Develop sustainable academic/commercial partnerships to assist in the exploitation and wider dissemination of the tumouroid technology. Our development programme so far has been integrated with three UK SMEs: TAP Biosystems; Oxford Opronix and Lein Applied Diagnostics. We have licensed IP to TAP and forsee opportunities for shared IP with all three, going forward. WS 8.0 Anticipate the health policy and health economic implications of incorporating tumouroids into clinical practice.

Although major advances in the treatment of MPN have been made in recent years, most MPN are incurable chronic disorders with substantial morbidity and mortality. The only curative treatment approach that can be offered at present is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Unfortunately, this procedure can only be performed in a small group of patients (young and fit). In all other patients, management is largely based on symptom-control and the use of growth-inhibitory drugs. However, most drugs used thus far in MPN, including the recently developed tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), have little if any curative potential. In addition, resistance to growth-inhibitory drugs is often seen in advanced MPN. So far, little is known about molecules, signaling networks, and mechanisms underlying disease evolution, progression, and resistance in various MPN. The situation is complicated by the fact that neoplastic stem cells (SC) exhibit intrinsic resistance, have multiple interactions with the SC-protective microenvironment, the so-called ?stem cell niche?, and acquire resistance in multiple subclones during disease evolution. Finally, the genetic background as well as epigenetic mechanisms are considered to play a role in disease evolution and progression in MPN. The general aim of this research program is to address the cellular, biochemical and functional complexity in various MPN by an integrated multidisciplinary approach, to exploit network analyses and resulting concepts to define critical target profiles in neoplastic (stem) cells, and to develop targeted treatment-strategies. The specific long-term aim of the SFB is to develop novel SC-eradicating treatment approaches in Ph+ and Ph- MPN. Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) will serve as a paradigmatic disease model in this SFB. In addition, the SFB will focus on JAK2 V617F-mutated MPN, KIT D816V-mutated systemic mastocytosis (SM) and mast cell leukemia (MCL), and FIP1L1/PDGFRA+ chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL). It can be expected that the SFB will substantially contribute to a better understanding of molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the etiology, progression, and resistance of neoplastic cells in these MPN. Furthermore, data generated in this SFB should provide a solid basis for the development of improved diagnostic and therapeutic concepts in these neoplasms.

In leukemia - a group of blood cancers affecting 300,000 new patients every year - we know over 100 driver mutations. This genetic complexity poses a daunting challenge for the development of targeted therapies and highlights the urgent need for evaluating them in combination. One gene class that has recently emerged as highly promising target space are chromatin regulators, which maintain aberrant cell fate programs in leukemia. The dependency on altered chromatin states is thought to provide great therapeutic opportunities, since epigenetic aberrations are reversible and controlled by a machinery that is amenable to drug modulation. However, the precise mechanisms underlying these dependencies and the most effective and safe targets to exploit them therapeutically remain unknown. Here we propose an innovative approach combining genetically engineered leukemia mouse models and advanced in-vivo RNAi technologies to explore chromatin-associated vulnerabilities at an unprecedented level of depth. Following a first screen in MLL-AF9;Nras-driven AML, which led to the discovery of BRD4 as a promising therapeutic target, we aim to (1) construct a knockdown-validated shRNA library targeting 520 chromatin regulators and use it to comparatively probe chromatin-associated dependencies in diverse leukemia subtypes; (2) explore the mechanistic basis of response and resistance to suppression of BRD4 and new chromatin-associated targets; and (3) pioneer a system for multiplexed combinatorial RNAi screening and use it to identify synergies between established and new chromatin-associated targets. We envision that this ERC-funded project will generate a comprehensive functional-genetic dataset that will greatly complement ongoing genome and epigenome profiling studies and ultimately guide the development of targeted therapies for leukemia and, potentially, other cancers.

Histone sequence variants are common in eukaryotic lineages and they generate diversity in chromatin structure to influence cellular specification and epigenetic inheritance. During spermatogenesis, animals and plants undergo a dramatic structural organization of the genome that serves to tightly package and protect paternal chromatin in preparation for its delivery to the female gametes. Studies in mice have shown that testis-specific histone variants mark specific loci to facilitate genome reorganization and poise genes for expression during embryogenesis. In plants, we have known of sperm specific-histone variants for nearly 20 years yet we still know little about their role in reprogramming the paternal genome. Arabidopsis sperm cells are characterized by the expression of two specific histone variants, HTB8 and HTR10, which encode histones H2B.8 and H3.10, respectively. Recent detailed marker analysis has shown that H2B.8 and H3.10 also accumulate in condensed chromatin of embryonic nuclei during late embryogenesis, suggesting a potential role in chromatin compaction. As such H2B.8 and H3.10 represent a fitting case study to explore the epigenetic role of histone variants in plant gametogenesis and late embryogenesis, providing insight into how chromatin architecture relates to differentiation. This proposal describes a 24-month project designed to characterize H2B.8 and H3.10 function by comparing both pollen and seed chromatin in Arabidopsis thaliana. In addition, pollen ontology will be used as a cellular system to profile spatial and temporal changes in chromatin organisation during development. To achieve the objectives of this proposal, the research methodology is designed to carry out five main objectives (1) to generate genome-wide maps of H2B.8 and H3.10 deposition by ChIP-seq analysis using both native and GFP antibodies (2) to use advance microscopy and profile gene expression in knockout mutants to determine the impact of H2B.8 and H3.10 on gene expression and chromatin condensation (3) to map the post-translational modifications H2B.8 and H3.10 accumulate in planta using mass-spectrometry (4) to compare the histone complement and global modification state of progenitor germ cell, sperm cell and vegetative cell chromatin using quantitative mass spectrometry (5) to identify H2B.8 and H3.10 orthologues in different angiosperm families and to demonstrate conserved male gamete-specificity using in situ hybridisation. The project is proposed to take place in Dr Frederic Berger’s lab at the Gregor Mendel Institute in Vienna.	Austrian Science Fund FWF	Lise Meitner Programme	157380.0	EUR
896	Darko Barisic	Cornell University Weill Medical College	Cornell University Weill Medical College	2017-09-01	2019-02-28	Role of chromatin dynamics and transcription factor binding in immune response and lymphomagenesis	The humoral immune response includes a sophisticated mechanism for creating antibodies against pathogens by stochastically mutating immunoglobulin genes. This process, termed somatic hypermutation, occurs in germinal centers of lymph nodes upon B-cell activation. Once activated, B-cells are reprogramed into a stem cell-like state of high proliferation and mutation tolerance in order to rapidly generate a broad range of antibodies with varying affinities. Mutant B-cell clones with affinity-enhancing mutations re-enter the cycle of somatic hypermutation to further increase antibody affinity. This cyclic reprograming of B-cells requires tight and rapid regulation of transcriptional states. Failure to exit the proliferation phase is thought to be a hallmark of B-cell malignant transformation in several types of lymphoma and is known to be dependent on epigenetic factors. Indeed, chromatin-modifying complexes, such as EZH2 and CREBBP/EP300, are found mutated in majority of follicular and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. However, how epigenetic marks are transiently established in the proliferation phase and rapidly restored upon exit remains unclear. The site-specific targeting of chromatin-modifying complexes to chromatin and the order of regulatory events is of particular interest. To this aim, I plan to use a germinal center organoid system that enables me to (1) rapidly and synchronously induce immunization of B-cells and (2) monitor changes on chromatin in a high-resolution time course, which is not feasible using FACS-sorted B-cells. Following the immunization, I will profile the dynamics of transcription factor binding as well as changes in chromatin marks using assays for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq). Moreover, I will couple ChIP-seq with chromatin indexing method to generate comprehensive, high-coverage maps over a multitude of time points in parallel. This approach will enable me to ask (1) which transcription factors recruit chromatin modifiers at the onset of the proliferation phase and once established, (2) which chromatin marks enable or prevent other transcription factors to bind in order to maintain the proliferation cue. Furthermore, to investigate whether global chromatin alterations found in lymphoma facilitate cancer progression and which mechanisms are involved, I plan to utilize a Brainbow 3.1 system. Brainbow 3.1 is cell-labeling technique that will allow me to track B-cell clones over time and follow chromatin dynamics in clones with high malignant potential. Combining Brainbow 3.1 system with the high-resolution ATAC-seq/ChIP-seq time course will be a powerful tool to create hierarchical maps of chromatin changes. It will enable us to answer fundamental questions about chromatin dynamics during both normal B-cell maturation and malignant transformation.

As about one third of the known cellular oncogenes are transcription factors (TFs), these represent highly interesting targets for potential therapeutic interventions, however remain challenging to target. In our experiments, we mainly use the pediatric tumor rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) as a model system. The alveolar subgroup (ARMS) with a very poor prognosis, is characterized by the expression of the tumor-specific chimaeric TF PAX3/FOXO1 (P3F). Survival of translocation-positive aRMS cells is dependent on continuous expression of the fusion protein in vitro as well as in vivo. Therefore, this TF represents an ideal and attractive therapeutic target. For this, we propose here to characterize further the interaction of an epigenetic modulator complex with P3F and to identify and rank the physiological importance of downstream targets. The embryonal subgroup (ERMS) is characterized by dependency on a cancer stem cell (CSC) subpopuation of cells. Therefore, we propose to target specifically cancer stem-like cells in this fusion negative RMS model. In summary, our approaches have the following aims:A. Validation of CHD4 as novel drug target in aRMS and development of novel small molecule inhibitors targeting the second PHD finger of CHD41. To validate CHD4 as novel drug target in aRMS2. To develop novel small molecule inhibitors targeting CHD4The results of the proposed experiments will support the hypothesis that CHD4, as part of the epigenetic modulator complex called NuRD, is a novel therapeutic target in aRMS. Importantly, we will develop a novel lead compound inhibitor for the first time targeting the CHD4 histone interaction. B. Identification of oncogenic key factors (drivers) from PAX3/FOXO1 target genes 1. To identify the minimal fusion protein target gene signature 2. To characterize the physiological role of the minimal number of signature genes and identify important inhibitor combinationsWe hypothesize that only few of the PAX3/FOXO1 target genes act as oncogenic drivers. Using a combination of bioinformatics and physiological screening, we will identify the most important drivers and validate corresponding drug combinations in vitro and in vivo.C. Identification of novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers for the Hedgehog regulated cancer stem cell compartment in ERMS 1. To identify and characterize novel Hh targets and/or co-regulators in ERMS 2. To identify biomarkers for Hh regulated CSC compartment in ERMSWe recently identified the hedgehog pathway as driver and marker of a CSC compartment in ERMS. Based on this, we propose now to identify additional therapeutic targets of this compartment as well as biomarkers to facilitate translation of this finding to the clinic. Pediatric sarcomas represent rare tumor types with still unacceptable low cure rates. Novel data characterizing the genomic landscape of RMS tumors revealed that fusion-positive tumors show little additional genetic alterations. Therefore, we focus our efforts on the biology of the fusion protein itself or important downstream target genes. Apart from a few single interactors, the interactome of the fusion protein has not been characterized yet and remains an important area of drug development. Several fusion protein target genes have been characterized, but their importance for RMS tumorigenesis has not been ranked yet. Finally, current knowledge about cancer development also has to incorporate identification of potential cancer stem cells. We have identified a cellular subpopulation from ERMS cells that drives self-renewal and is regulated by hedgehog activity. We aim here to identify additional actionable molecules and biomarkers for this subpopulation that should help to improve local control in ERMS patients.Hence, this project investigates different levels of RMS biology that will ultimately lead to identification of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of RMS and other diseases involving translocation products such as pediatric sarcomas.

These signals directly impinge on gene expression profile during differentiation, development, and disease. However, the role of physical and mechanical cues in shaping epigenetic states, which are crucial for gene expression regulation, is completely unknown. In this proposal, our aim is to quantify and study cell confinement induced (a) genome-wide and (b) locus-specific methylation levels in macrophages upon pro-inflammatory activation by LPS, which will help in uncovering important regulatory mechanisms during inflammation and disease. We propose to use a recently developed quantitative imaging-based “Super-Resolution Genome Mapping in Silicon Nano-Channels” to access the global and locus-specific methylation profile in confined and unconfined macrophages. If successful, knowledge about confinement induced alterations in DNA methylation and other epigenetic regulations will provide a better understanding of the molecular basis for various chronic inflammatory disease, which in turn will open opportunities for the development of efficient medications for specific targets.

899	Nino Künzli	University of Basel	Schweizerisches Tropen- und Public Health-Institut	2013-08-01	2014-01-31	Environment and Health - Bridging North, South, East and West	The Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute was successful in competing for the annual conference of three leading scientific societies, namely the International Society of Environmental Epidemiology (ISEE), the International Society of Exposure Sciences (ISES) and the International Society of Indoor Air Quality (ISIAQ). The high-profile 5-day conference is the first-ever joint conference of those trans-disciplinary societies. “Environment and Health - Bridging South, North, East and West' (www.ehbasel13.org) addresses the health relevance of global environmental challenges such as air pollution, traffic, noise, radiation including electromagnetic fields, chemicals, urban structure, climate and others. Its links with key morbidities, in particular non-communicable diseases such as cancer, cardiorespiratory, mental or metabolic disorders and the interaction with genetic and epigenetic mechanisms will be discussed. Risk assessments, interventions and policies to understand and reduce the burden of environmental health problems will be featured. Four Plenaries, 40 competitively selected symposia, and >110 oral sessions and poster discussions will provide a platform to share ~2’000 presentations with a highly international research community. A major goal of Swiss TPH is to enable scientists from low income countries - usually those with the biggest environmental health problems - to contribute to the conference. This is affordable only if travel support and registration waivers can be provided to awarded fellows. This application asks SNF to 1) provide the “Patronat” (auspice); 2) contribute CHF 15’000 to competitively assigned fellowships for young investigators; and 3) guarantee a further support of up to CHF 25’000 in case of an unexpected deficit. The conference budget of 1.5 Mio is planned for 1’500 participants. The extreme success of the call for symposia and abstracts (>2’000 submissions) indicates that the target will likely be met. However, economic hardship and unexpected turmoils such as an unexpected raise of the Swiss currency remain a risk.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Scientific Conferences	20000.0	CHF

Failure or abnormal presence of such epigenetic marks is often reported in several diseases including cancer. Our laboratory is focusing on the function of de novo DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, using B-cell development as a model. For this purpose we use conditional knockout mice for both Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b and have analyzed the role of these two enzymes in survival and long term maintenance of B-cell lineage. Indeed we found that in the absence of these two enzymes B-cell precursors are defective in proliferation in vitro, undergo apoptosis and also have deregulated gene expression profiles. By performing bisulfite sequencing we could provide evidences of altered methylation patterns in the promoter and non-promoter regions of some of the B lineage specific or cell type specific genes, for example Rag-2, a gene essential for the recombination of immunoglobulin heavy and light chain locus. Interestingly, activated mature B-cells lacking Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b appeared to be slightly skewed towards plasma cell differentiation. Together our data suggest a general phenomenon of DNA methylation-mediated regulation of inter- and intra-cellular molecular pathways which might also be applicable to other similar cell types, for example T-cells under immune activation. In our current proposal, we would like to test this hypothesis further and as well as characterize in detail the precise mechanism by which both Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b regulate gene expression, process of lineage commitment and also the maintenance of cellular integrity. For this purpose we plan to apply genomic and proteomic strategies and investigate the direct and indirect targets of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b during cellular differentiation setups. We anticipate discovering novel sets of genes, signaling networks and regulatory factors that might have implications in understanding both fundamental biological mechanisms underlying DNA methylation and influence of DNA methylation in immune cell function.

Intricate modifications of epigenetic landscapes occur during and around fertilization to ensure zygotic totipotency while maintaining genome integrity. Recent studies have shown that DNA methylation dynamics are more complicated than previously assumed, and might require multiple layers of reinforcing mechanisms to avoid the accumulation of deleterious epi-mutations. Although a lot of hypotheses have been made, little is known about the cell-specific aspect of DNA methylation at early stages of sexual reproduction in Arabidopsis. With this project, I intend to fill this gap by establishing cell-specific analysis of DNA methylation dynamics during reproduction. The characterization of reproduction-specific actors of the DNA methylation pathway will lead to the discovery of new mechanisms. Furthermore, I want to study the influence exerted by surrounding tissues in maintaining proper zygotic DNA methylation during sexual reproduction or during asexual somatic embryogenesis. Overall, I hope to decipher the cell-specific dynamics of the methylome during reproduction and gain insight into how the methylome is stably maintained without supressing diversity.

Many infected individuals are not aware of the diagnosis and will become symptomatic with the advent of complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma. Despite the availability of new drugs, treatment remains challenging due to its complexity, duration, cost, toxicities and potential emergence of drug resistance.Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAs) identified polymorphisms in IL28B, a gene encoding type III interferon (IFN), as important predictors of spontaneous and treatment induced clearance of HCV, but the functional mechanisms underlying this association are still elusive and their discovery remains an exciting challenge. Furthermore, the role of such polymorphisms for infections due to viruses other than HCV has been poorly explored. Altogether, functional immunogenetics may improve our knowledge of the pathogenesis of viral infections.The project will investigate the contribution of genetics and epigenetics on HCV clearance and on other infections, including those due to the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and herpesviruses. Specifically, the project will be divided in 3 specific aims.Aim 1We will identify and characterise IL28B polymorphism(s) associated with HCV clearance as follows1.1 To identify new IL28B variants, including• Variable nucleotide tandem repeats (VNTRs)• Epigenetic variations• Large DNA deletions/insertions1.2 To determine whether these IL28B markers are better predictors of spontaneous or treatment induced HCV clearance than previously identified IL28B markers in patients from the Swiss HCV Cohort study.1.3 To determine the mechanisms by which these IL28B markers influence IL28B function, by analysing• Their quantitative impact on IL28B and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) expression.• Their interaction with potential transcriptional/regulatory factors.Aim 2Polymorphisms nearby IL28B can only explain a fraction of individual variability in HCV clearance. To complete our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of hepatitis C, we will look for polymorphisms in genes other than IL28B that further influence this phenotype as follows:2.1 To identify rare variants by full exome sequencing of extreme HCV phenotypes, selected based on unusual response patterns. Those new variants will be functionally characterised in in vitro models.2.2 To find frequent variants by using a previous GWA dataset. Candidate genes will be selected from genes identified in full exome data as well as a systematic review of the literature (previous associations and genes known to be involved in HCV immunity).Aim 3Since polymorphisms in IL28B have a strong influence on HCV clearance, we will determine whether they also influence the natural history or clinical course of infections due to other viruses including HBV, herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) in patients from the Swiss HIV and Transplant Cohort Studies. Polymorphisms in genes discovered in aim 2 will also be analysed.Preliminary resultsOur preliminary observations from HCV infected patients identified a TT/-G substitution in the CpG region of IL28B as a better predictor of spontaneous HCV clearance and response to treatment than rs8099917 and rs12979860. The polymorphism induced the methylation of the adjacent cytosine residue and is a promising target for functional investigations. RelevanceImmunogenetic studies can contribute to a better understanding of antiviral immune mechanisms and improve the prevention and treatment of severe viral infections.

903	Rabih Murr	University of Geneva	Dépt de Médecine Génétique & Développement Faculté de Médecine Université de Genève	2014-09-01	2018-09-30	Crosstalk between genetic and epigenetic events in gene expression control and DNA damage response	At the beginning of the century, Hanahan and Weinberg proposed the six hallmarks of cancer (recently updated to include four additional hallmarks). These represent phenotypic changes observed during neoplastic disease progression. Underlying these hallmarks are defects in two essential cellular processes: transcription regulation and DNA damage response (DDR). These defects could be genetic (mutations), but also epigenetic. Interestingly, most cancers show an aberrant distribution of DNA methylation, an important epigenetic modification. Our aim is to understand how aberrant DNA methylation may contribute to transcriptional defects and genomic instability.The majority of factors involved in transcription regulation and DDR belong to the category of “DNA-binding factors” that need direct access to DNA in order to fulfill their function. However, in mammals, DNA is wrapped in a higher order structure called “chromatin” and is therefore not readily accessible. To overcome the impediment imposed by this structure, cells have evolved “epigenetic” mechanisms that can change the chromatin configuration without affecting the DNA sequence. DNA methylation is the only epigenetic modification that occurs directly on the DNA, mostly at cytosines in the context of CpG dinucleotides. Interestingly, DNA-binding factors seem to exclusively occupy regions of low DNA methylation levels. However, how DNA methylation affects the recruitment of DNA-binding factors is currently poorly understood. There are two types of DNA-binding factors: factors that bind to DNA in a sequence-specific fashion, such as transcription factors (TFs) and factors that bind to DNA in a sequence-independent fashion, such as DDR factors. Interestingly, both transcription and DDR seem to negatively correlate with the levels of DNA methylation.We are interested in studying the effect of DNA methylation on the recruitment of both types of DNA-binding factors on one hand, and the consequence of the recruitment of these factors on DNA methylation and the chromatin structure on the other hand. Results will contribute to our understanding of the role of DNA methylation in processes carried out by these factors, namely transcription regulation and DDR.The outcome will also have a major impact on our understanding of the mechanisms involved in cancer development and progression. Indeed, the study will allow to shed light on the implication of the aberrant distribution of DNA methylation observed in cancer cells, in the generation of defects in transcription regulation and DDR in these cells.

To this purpose, chromatin represents a major level of control Two groups of chromatin proteins are responsible for maintaining the differential gene expression patterns characterizing the individual cell types. The Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are required for a stable and heritable silencing of target genes. Conversely, the proteins of the Trithorax group (TrxG) counteract PcG repression and maintain the active expression state. Signals restricted in space and time initiate developmental choices, which are then subsequently maintained by the PcG/TrxG controlled chromatin functions. Hence, the interplay between these chromatin regulators utilizes epigenetic features and forms the molecular basis for the process of transcriptional memory. A major site of action for these epigenetic regulators is at promoters of target genes, in particular at promoters with a paused polymerase. PcG protein complexes place and bind histone modifications at repressed target genes, resulting in a reduced accessibility of the nucleosomal structure and in an inhibition of the transcriptional elongation process. The counteracting TrxG proteins exhibit functions, which open nucleosomal structures and allow the transcriptional machinery to enter processivity. Our understanding of transcriptional memory stems primarily from the involvement of the PcG and TrxG in maintaining developmental decisions. Here we would like to expand the view by analyzing whether environmentally induced stress conditions can impose epigenetically heritable gene expression states. We will used cellular systems inducible by environmental stimuli and combine new methodologies, like GRO-seq and PAR-CLIP, to study the dynamic behavior of PcG and TrxG proteins at target promoters and identify the crosstalk between the two groups at the transition from silenced to activated state. This will include the identification and functional analysis of non-coding RNAs found as important companions of PcG-induced repression. We will develop transgenic reporter systems in Drosophila sensing environmental cues and measure whether stress conditions can be imprinted into chromatin and epigenetically inherited through mitosis and meiosis.This project will provide mechanistic insight of how PcG and TrxG interactions faithfully maintain gene expression states. Given the broad spectrum of assignments this particular mechanism of transcriptional memory is executing, the knowledge gained on its role in memorizing environmental signals might even have implications for clinically relevant topics like susceptibility to late-onset diseases as diabetes or cancer.

905	Michael Seyffert	Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research Massachusetts Institute of Technology	Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research Massachusetts Institute of Technology	2016-02-01	2017-07-31	Regulatory Chromosome Structures in Cancer	We propose to study the relationships between chromosome structure and oncogene regulation that underlie the pathogenesis of multiple human cancers. Gene expression programs are implemented in the three dimensional context of the nucleus but the role that spatial chromatin organization plays in oncogenic gene expression programs is unclear. In all tumor cells studied thus far, transcription of key oncogenes is driven by super-enhancers, which are large domains of transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory structures. These super-enhancers function to drive high-level expression of tumor-addicted oncogenes and other genes associated with tumor pathogenesis. Perturbation of super-enhancer function with small molecules that inhibit transcriptional and epigenetic cofactors can have profound and selective effects on critical expression and tumor viability; it is possible that additional components of these regulatory domains can be targeted for cancer therapy. Recent studies in noncancer cells have shown that super-enhancers and their target genes occur within chromosome structures - called Super-enhancer Domains - that are crucial for proper transcriptional control of genes within and immediately outside that locus. Preliminary evidence indicates that oncogenic super-enhancer domains occur in tumor cells. We propose to investigate the structure and function of oncogenic super-enhancer domains within a selected cancer cell line and to identify factors that confer sensitivity to oncogene perturbation. To accomplish this goal, the specific aims of the proposal are (i) create an enhancer map that incorporate interactions with promoters of target genes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, (ii) identify oncogenic super-enhancer domains and determine their role in tumor maintenance, and (iii) identify transcriptional and epigenetic regulators that are essential for maintenance of oncogenic super-enhancer domains. The insights gained from these studies may ultimately facilitate the development and application of new therapeutic approaches for cancer.

New DNA methylation patterns are established by the de novo DNA methyltransferase enzymes DNMT3A and DNMT3B. During DNA synthesis, the global methylation landscape is copied onto the daughter DNA strand by the maintenance DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, thus warranting its heritability across mitosis, which is essential both for regulation of gene expression and maintenance of genomic stability. A recently identified family of DNA-modifying enzymes, the TET family of proteins, was shown to modify 5-methylcytosine (5mC) into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and to further oxidation products. These different modifications of the methyl mark can directly lead to specific transcriptional effects, while further oxidation and deamination of the modified base can eventually lead to loss of the methyl mark and heritable reprogramming of the epigenome. Importantly, alterations of the DNA methylation landscapes as well as mutations in specific DNA-modifying enzymes (most commonly DNMT3A and TET2) are frequently observed in different types of leukemia, but the specific mechanisms by which altered DNA methylation promotes tumorigenesis remain largely unknown. The role, if any, of altered DNA methylation in myeloproliferative disorders, namely pre-neoplastic conditions associated with dysregulated production of myeloid cells, is not understood. Our own unpublished data point toward a role for DNA methylation dynamics and TET2 in systemic mastocytosis, a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by the abnormal proliferation and accumulation of aberrant mast cells.In this project, we set out to dissect the impact of perturbing the DNA methylation landscape during myeloid differentiation to mast cells, as well as its effect on mast cell proliferation and function in normal and pathologic conditions. Specifically, I propose to investigate the following Aims:Aim 1: DNA methylation landscape in the presence or absence of DNA-modifying enzymes. With the goal of carefully dissecting DNA methylation dynamics during differentiation, we will analyse the genomic landscape of 5hmC/5mC as well as the expression of TET and DNMT enzymes during differentiation of mast cells from hematopoietic progenitors. Aim 2: Effects of mutations in DNA-modifying enzymes. Since Dnmt3a and Tet2 mutations play a role in the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative disorders, including systemic mastocytosis, we will investigate the effect of such mutations in mast cell differentiation and function, both in vitro and in vivo.Aim 3: Interplay between DNA-modifying enzymes and microRNAs. We will investigate how modifications in DNA methylation modulate microRNA expression, and also how microRNAs may reciprocally modulate expression and activity of DNA-modifying enzymes, thus impacting on the DNA methylation landscape. The hypotheses tested in this project are strongly supported by preliminary data in our own laboratory as well as by the available literature. These studies will significantly expand our understanding of the mechanisms underlying fundamental processes of myeloid cell production during normal homeostasis and disease.

Conversely, research still has to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying them. Several processes of social causation have been postulated, including patterns of unhealthy behaviors, psychosocial factors, and living and working conditions. Recent studies suggested that differences in lifestyle may contribute to a large proportion of social inequalities in health. In the last years, research started addressing the issue of how socioeconomic status eventually “gets under the skin”. Human and animal studies have identified several interrelated processes through which the social environment could be embedded, including dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, inflammatory processes, neural function and structure, and, ultimately, epigenetic mechanisms. These studies cover a promising new field of research, and several questions remain to be addressed: 1.Studies examining the biology of social adversity have generally described socioeconomic differences in biological markers, but the actual contribution of these intermediate steps to social inequalities in chronic diseases has rarely been evaluated. Further, few studies have evaluated the interactions between lifestyle-related risk factors and biological markers. 2.Some new lifestyle factors potentially implicated in the etiology of socioeconomic differences in health, such as inadequate sleep, have been under-researched. 3.The influence of early life vs. adult socioeconomic status on the biological pathways leading to diseases remains unknown, as well as the extent to which the impact of early life exposure to social adversity can be modified later in life. This research project will focus on cardio-metabolic disorders, which show a strong gradient in their social distribution and whose burden on the most disadvantaged sections of society is rapidly increasing worldwide. The overarching aim is to extend the study of social inequalities in health and their determinants by incorporating an analysis of the biological mechanisms linking lifetime social adversity to cardio-metabolic disease. Specific aims of this research are: 1.To assess the contribution of lifestyle factors (unhealthy behaviors, chronic stress and inadequate sleep) to the association between lifecourse socioeconomic status and cardio-metabolic disorders. 2.To establish the extent to which the contribution of lifestyle factors to social inequalities in cardio-metabolic disorders is mediated by socioeconomic differences in inflammatory markers.3.To understand if social adversity in early life has an impact on gene expression and DNA methylation, and if this can partly explain socioeconomic differences in inflammatory markers. This research project will provide a better understanding of the social, behavioural and biological pathways leading from lifetime socioeconomic adversity to adult life cardio-metabolic disease risk. This will not only add further observations on the role of exposure in early life in shaping health through adulthood, but will also clarify to what extent exposure to early life social adversity has an impact on adult health through behavioural vs. biological pathways. Moreover, this research will establish the extent to which the undesirable health consequences of adverse social exposure in early life are potentially reversible. Last but not least, an epigenome-wide analysis of socioeconomic differences in gene regulation will allow new insight to be gained into the mechanisms through which the social environment has an impact on health. Analyses will be conducted using data from 3 Swiss population-based studies (the CoLaus study, N=6000; the Bus Santé study, N=15,000; the SKIPOGH study, N=1100), the British Whitehall II study (N=10,308), and the multi-country METS study (N=2500). All studies have a longitudinal design allowing the assessment of incident health outcomes. Several indicators of socioeconomic status across the lifecourse (educational level, income, father’s occupation, among others) will be used in this research project. Lifestyle factors considered are health behaviors (smoking, alcohol consumption, diet and physical activity), inadequate sleep and chronic stress. Information on epigenome-wide gene expression and DNA methylation will be collected in a subsample of 250 participants of the SKIPOGH study. The multidisciplinarity (social epidemiology, cardiovascular, cardio-metabolic and genetic epidemiology, public health, sleep medicine, internal medicine, and molecular biology) characterizing this research project offers potential to produce novel and innovative answers to the question of how socioeconomic status over the lifecourse leads to disease decades later. Further, the use of five datasets offering a vast number of phenotypes measured repeatedly over time, along with precise indicators of socioeconomic status over the lifecourse, will allow the replication of results to ensure their consistency and the examination of between-country variations.

These include methylation of regulatory gene sequences, as well as gene modulation by microRNAs (miRNAs). Preeclampsia (PE) is a severe pregnancy-related disorder. The underlying etiology has been proposed to involve aberrant differentiation of placental trophoblast tissues. miRNA molecules and epigenetically modified DNA sequences can be detected in plasma in the form of cell-free nucleic acids.Working Hypothesis: PE involves alterations in epigenetic regulation leading to aberrant trophoblast differentiation.Aim: To examine for possible epigenetic mechanisms (miRNA and methylation) controlling trophoblast syncytialization, tissue modification/invasion or response to hypoxia/hyperoxia, in order to determine whether these play a role in the underlying etiology of PE.Experiment Design: In addition to affected placentae, use will be made of villous explant cultures and established trophoblast-like cell lines (BeWo and Jeg-3), in order to establish experimental techniques. miRNA mechanisms regulating trophoblast differentiation, syncytialization and response to O2 stress will be examined for by “deep sequencing” technology. Epigenetically silenced genes regulating these events will be screened for using a MeDIP (Methyl-DNA immunoprecipitation) approach, as well as pharmacological unmasking by treatment with 5-aza-2’-deoxycytodine (5-AZT). Alterations in protein expression levels will be confirmed by quantitative iTraq mass spectrometry. The pathological significance of miRNA or unmasked target genes will be reaffirmed by the blinded analysis of villous tissue from preeclamptic and healthy placentae, and their biomarker potential will be examined for using a dedicated maternal plasma bio-bank.Expected value of the proposed project: This interdisciplinary and inter-institutional research project could shed new light on potentially crucial regulatory mechanisms controlling placental development and their possible dysregulation in pregnancy-related pathologies (PE). Key regulatory molecules detected during this process could serve as the basis for a new generation of screening markers to reliably detect at-risk pregnancies.

Physiologically, Ca2+ signals result both from the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (endo/sarcoplasmic reticulum) as well as influx from the extracellular environment, via the opening of channels on the plasma membrane. In skeletal muscle, Ca2+ regulates contraction and relaxation and alterations in its regulation can lead to several neuromuscular disorders among which Malignant Hyperthermia, Core myopathies, Centronuclear myopathy, Native American Myopathy, Tubular aggregate myopathy and Brody’s disease. Type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) is a key protein involved in the regulation of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in skeletal muscle cells, playing a crucial role in muscle contraction by releasing Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum after plasma membrane depolarization. RyR1 is most abundantly expressed in skeletal muscles and to lower extents in some areas of the central nervous system, in antigen presenting cells (B-lymphocytes and dendritic cells) and in smooth muscle cells. Thus mutations in RYR1 (the gene encoding RyR1) may lead to alterations of Ca2+ homeostasis not only in skeletal muscle, but also in other tissues expressing this intracellular calcium release channel. Indeed RYR1 mutations have been implicated in other clinical conditions such as bleeding abnormalities, exertional rhabdomyolysis, sepsis and intensive care polyneuropathy, broadening the clinical spectrum of disorders linked to altered RyR1 function. The disease phenotype resulting from RYR1 mutations largely depends on their location within the RYR1 coding sequence and whether the mutations are dominant or recessive. Dominant mutations are more commonly associated with the Malignant Hyperthermia Susceptibility/exertional rhabdomyolysis and Central Core Disease phenotypes, while most cases of Multiminicore Disease, Centronuclear myopathy and Congenital Fiber Type Dysproportion phenotypes are associated with recessive mutations. From a general point of view, dominant RYR1 mutations affect the biophysical properties of the Ca2+ channel while the mode of action of recessive mutations has been more difficult to decipher but a consistent finding is a significant decrease of the RyR1 protein present in skeletal muscle. In order to gain mechanistic insight into the causes of this drastic decrease in RyR1 content, we have investigated if epigenetic modifications occur in the muscles of affected patients. Our results confirm that profound changes in the epigenetic landscape occur in the muscles of patients with recessive RYR1 mutations, including RYR1 CpG island hyper-methylation, decrease in muscle-specific microRNA content and abnormal expression of class II histone deacetylases. The aim of this project is to gain insight into the mechanisms causing the epigenetic modifications and validate whether they represent valid pharmacological targets. In order to do this we will use cellular and a knock in animal model that we have generated. The knock in mouse model will also help identify biomarkers that could be used to monitor disease progression or regression. Of importance, similar epigenetic modifications may occur in the muscles of patients affected by other congenital myopathies (nemaline, myotubular and SEPN1-related myopathies). One of the major aims of research in congenital myopathies is to find a common pharmacological target.

Upon microbial challenge, innate immune cells undergo a metabolic shift to meet energy requirements, for instance increased glycolysis (i.e. Warburg effect) in inflammatory macrophages. A growing number of evidence suggests that the innate immune system of mammals recalls a previous challenge to mount a robust response to a subsequent infection, a phenomenon called “trained immunity” or “innate immune memory”. Both epigenetic reprogramming and metabolic shift (Warburg effect) are associated with the acquisition of a trained phenotype in monocytes, although how these mechanisms interact is unknown.Sirtuins (SIRT1-7), members of the histone deacetylase superfamily, are epigenetic erasers that target thousands of non-histone proteins and impact on signaling and metabolic pathways. As such, sirtuins modulate immune responses with data reported mainly for the nuclear/cytoplasmic sirtuins SIRT1 and SIRT6, while the role of mitochondrial sirtuins (SIRT3-5) and the overlapping functions of sirtuins in immunity are barely characterized. Our general working hypothesis is that innate immune responses including training are intricately linked to sirtuins, through the positioning of sirtuins at the interface of epigenetic and metabolism. Our first aim is to tackle some open questions related to innate immune training, i.e. to which extent training: 1) protects from heterologous infections (using mouse models of infection), 2) affects bone marrow monocytes and reprograms bone marrow precursors (mouse studies), and 3) involves other cell types than monocytes within PBMCs (human CyTOF studies). The second aim is to address whether SIRT3 that inhibits the Warburg effect impacts on innate immune training in vitro and in vivo and to characterize the underlying mechanisms through transcriptome, epigenome and metabolomic profiling. Finally, since nothing is known about SIRT5 and immunity, and based on the assumption that dual knockout might reveal phenotypes unseen in single knockouts due to overlapping functions of sirtuins, the third aim is to characterize the impact of SIRT5, SIRT2/SIRT3 and SIRT3/SIRT5 deficiencies on innate immune responses.Altogether, this project will generate data essential to our comprehension of trained immunity and will strengthen our knowledge onto the impact of sirtuins on immune responses. On the long-term, therapies directed at training or at sirtuins could offer new treatment options to improve vaccine efficacy or normalize dysregulated metabolic and inflammatory processes in non-infectious and infectious pathologies, including sepsis that is characterized by immunoparalysis and broad metabolic disturbances.

Defects in mounting appropriate inflammatory and innate immune responses may have dramatic consequences, as observed in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. In recent years, our understanding of the regulation of the innate immune response and the pathogenesis of sepsis has increased tremendously. Unfortunately, this has not yet translated into efficient treatment strategies for septic patients. The superfamily of histone deacetylases (HDACs) comprises 11 “classical” Zn-dependent HDACs (HDAC1-11) and 7 NAD+-dependent sirtuins (SIRT1-7). Through epigenetic and non-epigenetic mechanisms mediated by deacetylation of histones and other proteins, HDACs impact on many biological processes and the development of age-associated oncologic, metabolic, cardiovascular, neurodegenerative and immune diseases. Hence, HDACs are promising targets for treating a panel of diseases. During the course of the previous grant, we have shown that inhibitors of HDAC1-11 (HDACi) are powerful anti-inflammatory drugs and reported a proof of concept study demonstrating that HDACi protect from septic shock. Sirtuins are poorly studied compared to classical HDACs. Since sirtuins control metabolic pathways and energy homeostasis, they are likely to be involved in the regulation of inflammatory and immune responses. SIRT1 and SIRT6 have been reported to influence inflammatory responses, but results are contradictory. Nothing is known for other sirtuins, albeit SIRT2 and SIRT3 are very attractive candidates. Indeed, SIRT2 is the most expressed sirtuin in myeloid cells and SIRT3, the main mitochondrial deacetylase, controls the generation of mitochondrial ROS that participate in host defences and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. Interestingly, metabolic stress modulates the expression of SIRT2 and SIRT3, and septic patients have major metabolic disturbances.Our working hypothesis is that sirtuins have important immunomodulatory functions, and that sirtuins may offer new treatment opportunities to target dysregulated inflammatory and metabolic processes in sepsis. Our specific aims are: a) to define whether SIRT2 and SIRT3 impact on innate immune responses especially in conditions of metabolic stress (i.e. calorie restriction and high fat diet regimen in mouse models), and b) to characterize polymorphisms of sirtuin genes and study their influence on the development of sepsis and possibly other infectious diseases. The data arising from these studies will be confronted to the data obtained from studies of sirtuin expression and epigenetic modifications of histones in septic patients. To guarantee a rapid progress towards the objectives of our application, we have generated SIRT2 and SIRT3 knockout mouse lines and have access to DNA from a very well characterized sepsis cohort. Moreover, our preliminary results suggest that SIRT2 and SIRT3-deficiencies impair the response to exotoxin and endotoxin.Altogether, these studies will strengthen our knowledge onto the impact of sirtuins on immune responses, and will provide new insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying inflammatory and innate immune responses. Importantly, analyses of sirtuin polymorphisms combined with clinical studies in septic patients will challenge the relevance of sirtuins in the pathogenesis of human sepsis. Beside sepsis, the research project will generate results that are likely to be pertinent for other inflammatory and autoimmune conditions.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div.

The latter include thymic epithelial cells (TECs), various dendritic cell (DC) subsets, B cells and macrophages. MHCII-mediated Ag presentation by these APCs orchestrates T cell development in the thymus, the establishment of thymic self-tolerance, the maintenance of tolerance in the periphery, and the initiation, regulation and implementation of adaptive immune responses directed against pathogens and tumors. These processes depend on precisely regulated patterns of Ag presentation, and deficient or deregulated APC function consequently has profound pathological consequences. We have a long-standing interest in deciphering the mechanisms that regulate Ag presentation and the function of APCs in health and disease. The work proposed here will focus on three subprojects (parts A to C) constituting direct continuations of our past research in this field. All three subprojects address novel questions concerning the mechanisms that regulate the functions of APCs. Subproject A will address the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern formation and homeostasis of the thymic medulla - a compartment that is essential for establishing central T cell tolerance - by autoreactive CD4+ thymocytes. Specific aims of subproject A will be to a) assess the sensitivity of medulla formation and homeostasis to the frequency of Ag-specific CD4+ thymocytes, b) determine how medulla formation and homeostasis is influenced by affinity of the TCR of CD4+ thymocytes for Ag-MHCII complexes displayed by mTECs and c) define the respective contributions to medulla formation and homeostasis of conventional autoreactive CD4+ thymocytes and natural regulatory T cells (nTregs). Subproject B will address the function of the Btn2a2 gene. The latter is tightly regulated in APCs by RFX and CIITA - two transcription factors dedicated for MHCII expression - and encodes a distant relative of the B7 family of costimulatory molecules implicated in modulating T cell activation. To study the function of this gene we have recently generated Btn2a2 knockout mice. Preliminary results have indicated that Btn2a2-/- mice exhibit exacerbated T cell responses suggesting that Btn2a2 serves an inhibitory function. Specific aims of subproject B will be to a) characterize the mechanism responsible for exacerbated immune responses in Btn2a2-/- mice, b) study the impact of Btn2a2-deficiency on the development of autoimmunity and c) identify the receptor of Btn2a2. Subproject C will address the molecular mechanisms responsible for triggering and implementing a large-scale transcriptional silencing program that we have found to be a general and evolutionarily-conserved feature of DC maturation. Characterization of this novel process has revealed that it contributes to rapid and widespread epigenetic remodelling of the transcription program in DCs. It notably appears to contribute to the establishment of a refractory state rendering the mature DCs unresponsive to further stimuli. Specific aims of subproject C will be to a) decipher the signaling pathways that mediate the establishment of epigenetic silencing, b) identify histone deacetylases that establish wide-scale silencing via histone deacetation and c) characterize the mechanisms that render mature DCs unresponsive to further stimuli. The projected work will strengthen our knowledge on the molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate the functions of specific APCs. Deciphering these processes is critical for our comprehension of the initiation, regulation and development of adaptive immune responses in health and during the course of disease.

SummaryTwo complete sets of instructions contained within the genomes we inherit from our parents are responsible for directing a single cell - the zygote - to become an adult human being. This process results from controlled patterns of gene expression that are maintained as well as changed during many rounds of cell division, differentiation, and death. Control of gene transcription is fundamental to these processes, with genetic and epigenetic defects in transcriptional regulation often leading to human disease including cancer.The overall goal of this project is to understand these processes of regulated human-cell proliferation and differentiation. Toward this goal, we study the structure, function, and evolution of the cell proliferation factor HCF-1 in human cells and animal models. Our studies originate with the use of herpes simplex virus (HSV) to probe for such regulatory events. When HSV infects human cells, it is able to enter two modes of infection: lytic and latent. A key activator of lytic infection is a virion protein called VP16, which, upon infection of a permissive cell, forms a transcriptional-regulatory complex with two cellular proteins - HCF-1 and the POU-domain transcription factor Oct-1 - to activate viral transcription. By containing both viral and cellular proteins, this 'VP16-induced complex' or VIC provides a viral strategy for selection between lytic and latent infection and thus effective coexistence with its host. Viruses often target important cellular regulatory proteins to promote viral infection and HSV is no exception. Indeed, HCF-1 is a central and conserved metazoan regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation as it regulates gene expression and chromatin function via diverse mechanisms. It serves as a versatile molecular adaptor bringing together - in different combinations - promoter-specific transcription factors with a constellation of chromatin modifying activities associated with both activation and repression of transcription. HCF-1 has also revealed unusual mechanisms of post-translational regulation of protein function and protein-protein interaction, while being implicated in the regulation of active human promoters.Thus, our recent completed studies have shown that: (i) an enzyme previously only known to glycosylate intracellular proteins - the O-linked ß-N-acetylglucosamine transferase OGT - is responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of HCF-1 into non-covalently associated subunits; (ii) for non-covalent association, the HCF-1 subunits create a hybrid Fn3 repeat module with portions of each subunit; (iii) the HCF-1 nuclear localization signal (NLS) is bi-functional, being involved in both cellular localization and transcriptional complex assembly; (iv) HCF-1 resides at a large majority of active transcriptional start sites in proliferating human cells; and (v) HCF proteins play broad roles in metazoan development. We propose to continue investigating the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation by HCF-1 with diverse and integrated molecular, genetic, bioinformatic, structural, and developmental approaches. Our specific goals are:1. To understand the structural and molecular functions of HCF-1 proteins.2. To reveal mechanisms of regulation of HCF-1 function by proteolytic and non-proteolytic post-translational modification. 3. To determine the functions of HCF-1 in mouse embryonal-stem cell maintenance and differentiation, and mouse brain development, organ regeneration, and HSV reactivation.

A key activator of lytic infection is a virion protein called VP16, which, upon infection of a permissive cell, forms a transcriptional regulatory complex with two cellular proteins - the POU-domain transcription factor Oct-1 and the cell-proliferation factor HCF-1 - to activate transcription of the first set of expressed viral genes. We hypothesized a number of years ago that VP16 forms a transcriptional regulatory complex with two cellular proteins - rather than activate transcription independently of cellular factors - to provide a strategy for the virus to decide between lytic and latent modes of infection and thus coexist with its host. We further hypothesized that, much in the way DNA tumor viruses (such as adenoviruses, papillomaviruses, and papovaviruses) target important cellular regulatory proteins such as pRb (retinoblastoma protein) and p53 to manipulate the status of the infected cell, the HSV VP16 protein, in forming the VP16-induced complex, probably targets important cellular regulatory proteins as well. Indeed, Oct-1 was known to be an important transcriptional regulator of genes involved in cell proliferation (e.g., histone and small nuclear RNA-encoding genes) and differentiation (e.g., immunoglobulin-encoding genes). Studies of HCF-1 here and elsewhere are revealing that it is a central regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation in its roles as a regulator of gene expression and chromatin function. Indeed, our recent studies have shown that HCF-1 antagonizes the activity of pRb by promoting the ability of E2F1 to sustain cell-cycle progression and, when missexpressed, DNA damage and apoptosis; thus the hypothesis that HCF-1 targets important cellular regulatory proteins and processes has been substantiated. From this exciting foundation, the objective of this research plan is to further our understanding of the roles of HCF-1 in cell-cycle progression and differentiation, in humans as well as three model organisms: the mouse, the fly Drosophila melanogaster, and the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, with increasing emphasis on the mouse model.Our specific goals are:1. To understand the roles of HCF-1 in human cell-cycle progression.2. To reveal mechanisms and regulation of HCF-1 proteolytic maturation. 3.To uncover functions of HCF-1 in the regulation of Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster development.4.To determine the functions of HCF-1 in mouse development, organ regeneration and embryonal-stem cell maintenance and differentiation.

Chromosome condensation is initiated at mitosis entry and ensures packaging of the genetic material into units that the mitotic spindle can move, separate and segregate. During condensation, sister chromatids must therefore become tightly compacted in parallel to individualizing themselves from each other through decatenation and cohesion resolution. During this process, they must remain attached to each other through their centromeres until anaphase onset. Thus, the condensation of the chromosome comprises a number of events that must probably proceed in coordinated and regulated manners. Strikingly, recent observations suggest that chromosome condensation influences many processes beyond mitosis, such as DNA repair, fate determination and ageing. However, we know very little about how chromosomes condense at mitosis and how this impacts chromosome biology.In addition to preexisting assays measuring the axial contraction of chromosomes, we recently developed novel assays probing chromatin compaction during chromosome condensation in vivo. Over the course of these studies we have discovered that the centromere gates the condensation of chromosomes. In addition to opening new avenues to study chromosome condensation and of how chromatids individualize themselves, our discoveries provide means to manipulate the condensation of chromosomes and to uncouple it from cell cycle progression. They reveal that mutants keeping their chromatin largely condensed during interphase are fully viable. We will build on these assays and observations to study the mechanisms of chromosome condensation and its regulation by the centromere, and to characterize the effects of condensation on chromosome biology and cellular physiology. Our project is divided in two parts.1 Role of the centromere in condensation. We will determine how the centromere kick-starts the condensation of the chromosome upon mitosis entry and establish how the condensation signal spreads from there along the chromosome arms. We will dissect how this signal promotes and coordinates the different events shaping mitotic chromosomes.2 Role of condensation in ageing. We will determine how condensation and ageing are linked in budding yeast. We will build on preliminary data indicating that condensation resets chromatin marks to investigate whether chromosome condensation in mitosis counteracts ageing-dependent changes of chromatin organization and gene expression. Beyond providing extensive insights into how sister-chromatids condense themselves during mitosis, our studies will shed light into how chromosome condensation is coordinated with cell cycle progression and cellular physiology, contributes in return to these processes and protects the cell against ageing. Particularly, our data will reveal how a single locus (here the centromere) can control the organization of large chromosomal domains, and how such reorganization influences the deposition and maintenance of epigenetic information.

Serotonin signaling, including HTR2A and HTR1A, is implicated in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and other neuropsychiatric disorders. The HTR2A -1438G/A polymorphism has been associated with early-onset OCD, but its functional significance is unclear. HTR1A can be functionally antagonistic to HTR2A. Furthermore, epigenetic modifications may affect serotonin signaling. We will test the hypothesis that OCD and the -1438G/A HTR2A promoter polymorphism influence serotonin signaling in lymphocytes, focusing on HTR2A and HTR1A downstream targets. We have identified downstream targets regulated by HTR2A and HTR1A in neuronal cell culture and will test their changes in lymphocytes from OCD patients and healthy controls. We will also test the -1438G/A HTR2A polymorphism effect on HTR2A target molecules expression and on HTR2A promoter histone acetylation and methylation in lymphocyte cultures from OCD patients. We expect our results to enrich knowledge about dysregulation of serotonergic signaling and genetic vulnerability to early-onset OCD.

It normally lives as commensal in humans but, in certain environmental conditions, such as those found in immunocompromised patients, it can become virulent causing systemic life-threating diseases. Emergence of drug-resistant C. albicans strains poses an additional public health problem. C. albicans is a highly successful pathogen partly due to its remarkable genome plasticity. The C. albicans genome is relatively stable in normal laboratory growth conditions but it becomes unstable under stress conditions, such as an anti-fungal treatment. Even though very little is known about mechanisms inducing C. albicans genome plasticity, it is clear that DNA repeats play an important role in this process. Our major goal is to understand the role of DNA repeats in modulating C. albicans genome plasticity. In many organisms, genome stability at DNA repeats is ensured by the assembly of a heterochromatin structures inhibitory to recombination. The chromatin status associated with C. albicans DNA repeats is uncharacterised and it is unknown whether it contributes to genome stability. In this project, we will employ a combination of low-throughput and high-throughput approaches to determine the chromatin state associated with C. albicans DNA repeats and assess the role of chromatin in C. albicans genome plasticity upon environmental changes.

Despite the significant progress on many fronts in the cardiovascular field, non-inherited epigenetic regulation in cardiac aging and CVD remains unexplored. Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major contributor to healthcare costs and it is the leading indication for heart transplantation. We have recently discovered that adult cardiac-specific deletion of epigenetic regulator Bmi1 in mice induces DCM and heart failure. These unprecedented data support the idea that inadequate epigenetic regulation in adulthood is critical in CVD. In addition, our studies with parabiotic pairing of healthy and DCM-diagnosed mice show that the circulation of a healthy mouse significantly improve the cardiac performance of mouse with DCM. These ground-breaking discoveries suggest that DCM regression, or cardiac rejuvenation, is feasible in terms of epigenetic states. Therefore, YOUNGatHEART will unveil significant breakthrough on (1) how non-inherited epigenetic deregulation induces DCM and (2) how epigenetic remodeling reversed this process. For that, our challenges are: 1A. To decipher how aged-linked cardiac dysfunction contributes to CVD by identifying the epigenetic landscape regulating cardiac aging among species; 1B. To decode how epigenetic deregulation induces DCM by integrating clinical data and samples from DCM-transplanted patients with imaging, transcriptomic, proteomic, and functional approaches from DCM model; and, 2A. To identified systemic factors with anti-cardiomyopathic effects by systematic proteomic screenings after parabiosis and epigenome of the DCM hearts. In sum, YOUNGatHEART puts forward an ambitious but feasible and pioneering program to tackle the epigenetic hallmark in cardiac aging with the final aim (2B) of setting the molecular basis for future therapeutic interventions in CVD.

The region consists of a 14 base-pair tandem repeat DNA sequence of 5'- ACAGGGGTGTGGGG-3'/3'-TGTCCCCACACCCC-5' and located 363 bp upstream of the transcription start site. Mutations or differences in the length of the ILPR has been linked to the development of both Type-1 and Type- 2 diabetes. The ILPR can form alternative DNA secondary structures such as G-quadruplexes and i-motifs. We predict that it is possible to modulate insulin transcription specifically by targeting the i-motif forming sequences in the ILPR. Through work funded by Diabetes UK we have identified several compounds which can specifically stabilise imotif DNA structures in the ILPR, in biophysical assays. Through support from a Wellcome Trust Pathfinder award we know which of these compounds can alter gene expression. This project aims to develop the compounds as new chemical biological probes and learn more about how DNA structure affects the ILPR. This would lead to several tools and proteins as well as both genetic and epigenetic information about this important region of DNA and its role in the development of diabetes.

They promote the growth and invasion of cancer cells and are known for their tumor-promoting properties. Compared to normal fibroblasts (NFs), CAFs are permanently activated. Several studies report that CAFs are epigenetically distinct from NFs. Because it is becoming clear that the crosstalk between cancer cells and CAFs plays a pivotal role in cancer, understanding this communication-based relationship has the potential to include CAFs in the shooting range of cancer therapy. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles that carry proteins, mRNA, ncRNAs and DNA. We have recently shown intercellular trafficking via exosomes contributes to horizontal reprogramming and functional re-education of recipient cells. Our preliminary data shows that NFs undergo significant changes in epigenetic marks when exposed to cancer exosomes. Furthermore, we have found that specific proteins present in cancer exosomes involved in epigenetic changes in the DNA of CAFs. Therefore, we hypothesize that cancer exosomes contain epigenetic regulators leading to changes in gene expression in CAFs, ultimately supporting its tumor-promoting properties. To address our hypothesis we will use state of the art technology available at our laboratory to analyze exosomes, and orthotopic as well as genetically modified mouse models. The research team is multidisciplinary, with a strong collaborative past, and with experts with an excellent track record in all the fields relevant for the project. Our project brings about a novel concept of communication via exosomes, through which cancer cells subjugate other cellular components of the tumor microenvironment to support and sustain tumor growth and invasion. Most importantly, our project paves the way for the possibility of targeting cellular communication-mediated by exosomes as an anti-cancer therapy.

A large body of epidemiological data demonstrates a link between maternal infection during pregnancy and higher incidence of psychiatric conditions with a presumed neurodevelopmental origin (e.g., schizophrenia and autism) among the offspring. Converging evidence suggests that cytokine-associated inflammatory events, together with downstream pathophysiological processes such as oxidative stress and hypoferremia, are critical in mediating the adverse effects of maternal infection on the offspring. However, it remains essentially unknown how such early-life adversity translates into enduring negative effects on brain and behavior postnatally. One feasible but yet unexplored possibility would be that the long-term consequences of prenatal immune challenge may result from early-life priming of epigenetic modifications, i.e. through changes in gene expression without altering the DNA code. Against this background, the research proposed herein aims to establish a novel role of epigenetic mechanisms in translating the adverse long-term effects of prenatal maternal infection on brain and behavioral abnormalities emerging in the first-generation descendants, and to explore the possibility of trans-generational transmission of these pathological effects across subsequent generations. Using a well-established experimental mouse model of prenatal immune challenge, the planned project will identify putative epigenetic modifications in direct descendants of gestationally immune-challenged mothers and in subsequent generations, and to ascertain the functional contribution of such epigenetic alterations to long-term brain and behavioral dysfunctions with a particular emphasis on abnormalities relevant to schizophrenia and autism. The experimental model is based on maternal gestational treatment with poly(I:C) (= polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid), a synthetic analog of virus-specific double-stranded RNA that stimulates a cytokine-associated viral-like inflammatory response in the maternal and fetal compartments, including the fetal brain. In recent years, extensive experimental work performed by the Principal Investigator’s research team and other research groups has demonstrated that the mouse poly(I:C) model of prenatal immune challenge is a very powerful inflammation-based model system for the study of brain and behavioral dysfunctions relevant to neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, autism and bipolar disorder. This model enjoys a high degree of face, construct and predictive validity for these illnesses, including etiological relevance, and is thus highly suitable for the planned investigations exploring the role of epigenetic modifications in the link between prenatal immune challenge and neurodevelopmental disease. A multi-disciplinary approach combining a wide spectrum of epigenetic, behavioral, pharmacological, and neuroanatomical techniques will be used to provide ground-breaking insights into epigenetic factors underlying the link between prenatal infection and risk of neurodevelopmental brain disorders. This will be achieved by (i) identifying epigenetic changes in key neuronal targets such as the GABAergic and dopaminergic systems, (ii) correlating the anticipated epigenetic modifications with behavioral and cognitive disturbances, (iii) confirming the contribution of identified epigenetic changes to behavioral impairments by pharmacological interventions, and (iv) exploring trans-generational pathological and epigenetic effects of prenatal immune challenge. In summary, the proposed research contains novel and highly topical experimental investigations which aim to obtain imperative new information with respect to the role of epigenetic factors in mediating long-term (and possibly trans-generational) brain and behavioral pathology following prenatal exposure to immune challenge.

It very often results from substantial and permanent loss of the contractile cells of the heart, the cardiomyocytes (CMs), caused by ischemic heart disease or apoptosis . An effective treatment for patients with heart failure requires the reconstitution of functional CMs, either through intrinsic CM regeneration or by cell-based replacement therapies. The adult mammalian heart shows a poor regenerative response to CM injury. In stark contrast, the zebrafish (D. rerio) is able to initiate a rapid regenerative process, resulting in generation of functional myocardium by CM proliferation . The discovery of the zebrafish CM’s potential to undergo proliferation leading to full recovery upon injury has prompted research aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms driving this process, with the ultimate goal of finding new strategies to activate CM proliferation in mammals. Although some molecular regeneration-permissive or -prohibitive players have been identified, their subtle and complex regulation has not yet been completely uncovered. We propose here to firstly develop a new tool in zebrafish that will allow the in vivo cell-specific, inducible and reversible modulation of proteins in CMs. Next, we propose to uncover changes in methylation and demethylation events occurring at early stages in CMs as an immediate response to injury and that are possibly involved in the establishment of a pro-regenerative chromatin pattern. Finally, we propose to assess in vivo the requirement of given epigenetic modifiers during zebrafish heart regeneration, by modulating them using a pharmacological approach and by inducing their degradation in a spatio-temporally controlled manner, to define the molecular factors that modulate regenerative capacity.The proposed experiments include the establishment of an in vivo protein degradation tool, which we will make available to the entire zebrafish community, enabling investigation of the requirement for given proteins’ function in diverse biological processes. Combining this tool with the study of the genetic signature of CMs in response to injury, the proposed experiments will lead to a better understanding of the epigenetic modifications underlying the increased competence of CMs to proliferate and of the epigenetic modifiers coordinating this response. Our study will provide a foundation for future mechanistic work to better understand the factors that facilitate tissue regeneration. The epigenetic mechanisms underlying the intrinsic competence of zebrafish CMs to proliferate in response to injury will be of high relevance for the regenerative biology community. For instance, these mechanisms could mediate a proliferative response in other organs with low regenerative capacity in mammals, as well as for generation of cardiomyocytes in vitro (e.g. using iPS cells).

Diabetes often manifests in childhood and early diagnosis is essential for treatments that aim at preventing long-term complications. Various forms of diabetes exist, such as type 1 and type 2, which have complex etiologies involving multiple genes. Additional forms of diabetes have been described that are caused by altered function of a single gene. Monogenic diabetes (MD) is typically associated with point mutations or epigenetic alterations of gene expression. Several forms of MD were initially classified as “maturity onset diabetes of the young” (MODY) and have led to a list of implicated genes. All MDs have in common that they eventually cause a defect of pancreas development or turn off the function of the beta cell machinery. A definite diagnosis of MD can only be achieved by genetic analysis. This is technically challenging and costly, which are among the reasons for many missed diagnoses. Currently a conservative estimation is that MD accounts for about 2% of all diabetic patients. Recent data in the UK found that 13% of patients diagnosed with diabetes in young adult life suffer from a form of diabetes other than type 1 or 2. The identification of the known genes involved as well as screening for novel genes is therefore of outmost importance for the patient, because it will determine the choice of the treatment (e.g. switch from multiple daily insulin injections to oral antidiabetics) and efficient prevention of long-term complications.PROJECT RATIONALE: We hypothesize that all genes controlling pancreas development and beta cell function, if altered, can potentially cause MD. Because only a few genes have been implicated in MD, many cases escape biased approaches, which is why MD represents a widely underdiagnosed entity, particularly in the pediatric population. We believe that this hypothesis is most efficiently tested with an interdisciplinary approach, combining clinical endocrinology and human genetics. We propose to screen diabetic children who have no signs of autoimmunity (i.e. lack of antibodies typically associated with Type 1) or who present with diabetes associated with congenital malformations of the pancreas. For this purpose, we will use cutting edge techniques in human genetics to investigate the complex mechanisms of diabetes development and identify new genes or regulatory regions involved in the development of the beta cell. We therefore propose the following specific aims:Aim 1: To investigate the consequences of genetic adverse events on pancreas development, beta cell and metabolic functions in the human. We will follow up on complications associated with these gene constellations. Furthermore, we will also apply new genetic tools to a cohort of unresolved cases of patients suffering from diabetes of non-autoimmune origin.Aim 2: To identify new genes involved in MD with (1) high-throughput deep-sequencing to identify genetic mutations in specific genes selected for their known or potential involvement in pancreas development and beta cell differentiation. In parallel, we will construct (2) libraries of multiplexed indexed individual DNAs to rapidly analyze several gigabytes of DNA sequences, before finally (3) moving to whole exome sequencing and (4) functional analysis.EXPECTED VALUE: The present interdisciplinary initiative represents the first of its kind in Switzerland. This project represents the first step for building up a Swiss cohort of MD and will be followed by further molecular analysis of newly identified genes. If successful, we will not only extend the list of genes causing MD but also provide insight into the physiology in human pancreas development and beta cell function. These results may help to identify novel targets to efficiently treat MD to prevent long-term complications in affected children. Moreover, the mechanistic insight may also serve to expand the therapeutic approaches to polygenic forms of diabetes.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Interdisciplinary projects	500000.0	CHF

Chronic hyper-proliferation leads to a series of genetic and epigenetic modifications of these cells gradually developing into a malignant cancer. Progression of MM in humans is in most cases symptom-free until a very late stage of the disease, a main reason for the poor prognosis for MM patients; survival is dramatically low (median survival < 12 months), despite efforts to improve MM treatment. As previously demonstrated in other cancer types, a sub-population of tumor cells characterized by their increased chemoresistance and sharing properties of cancer stem cells (CSC) is also assumed to exist in MM. This could explain why initial tumor growth can be efficiently blocked by chemotherapy, while the few surviving CSC-like cells will lead to a rather rapid recurrence and relapse of the tumor. In the field of MM research, the previously identified chemoresistant cells are often called side population (SP) and are characterized by their capability to extrude dye molecules such as Hoechst 33342 by ATP-binding cassette protein (ABC) transporter family members, e.g. ABCG2. SP cells express markers such as CD9, CD24, CD26 and previously identified stem cell markers. In other types of tumors, CSC are considered as important targets for cancer therapy.For this project we used a tool developed for stem cell Biology enabling the identification and selection of Sox2- and Oct4-expressing cells, both considered as stem cell markers and often expressed in CSC. A lentivirus approach was chosen, initially developed to screen for induced pluripotent stem cells that uses the expression of Sox2- and Oct4-binding site driven eGFP expression, to identify putative MM CSC. Our preliminary data demonstrate the presence of such CSC-like eGFP-expressing cells in all MM cell lines tested, including ZL55 and MSTO-211H, H226, ZL5, SPC212 and SPC111 cells. These cells can be highly enriched (>99%) due to their puromycin resistance present in the lentivirus construct. eGFP-expressing ZL55 cells are more resistant to the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin (cis-Pt) and express significantly higher mRNA levels of SOX2, OCT4, ABCG2 and another proposed CSC marker, colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1R). Initially, we plan to verify the existence and the frequency of these putative CSC in cell lines derived from all histological and molecular types of MM. Moreover we will test whether such a stem cell-like population is also present in primary mesothelial cells or immortalized mesothelial cells, the latter considered as the first step towards transformation. We will test for their increased chemoresistance in vitro. In a next step, we will functionally (growth characteristics, in vivo behavior, etc) and molecularly (gene expression analysis, next generation sequencing) characterize the CSC-like cells. Finally, we will test them for chemoresistance (cis-Pt and antifolate chemotherapy) and perform high-throughput screening for putative anti-cancer compounds. In our project we expect to shed light on the processes implicated in MM tumor formation and more importantly, on the role of putative CSC cells in MM tumor relapse, the main cause for the rapid death of MM patients. We expect that efficient targeting of CSC represents a novel strategy to combat MM.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Early Postdoc.Mobility	None	None
927	Winship Herr	University of Lausanne	Centre Intégratif de Génomique Université de Lausanne	2017-01-01	2019-12-31	Regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation	Two complete sets of instructions contained within the genomes we inherit from our parents are responsible for directing a single cell - the zygote - to become an adult human being. This process results from controlled patterns of gene expression that are maintained as well as changed during many rounds of cell division, differentiation, and death. Control of gene transcription is fundamental to these processes, with genetic and epigenetic defects intranscriptional regulation often leading to human disease including cancer.The overall goal of this project is to understand these processes in the regulation of human-cell proliferation and differentiation. Toward this goal, we study the structure, function, and evolution of the cell proliferation factor HCF-1 in human cells and animal models. Our studies originate with the use of herpes simplex virus (HSV) to probe forsuch regulatory events. When HSV infects human cells, it is able to enter two modes of infection: lytic and latent. A key activator of lytic infection is a virion protein called VP16, which, upon infection of a permissive cell, forms a transcriptional-regulatory complex with two cellular proteins - HCF-1 and the POU-domain transcription factor Oct-1 - to activate viral transcription. By containing both viral and cellular proteins, this 'VP16-induced complex'or VIC provides a viral strategy for selection between lytic and latent infection and thus effective coexistence with its host.Viruses often target important cellular regulatory proteins to promote viral infection and HSV is no exception. Indeed, HCF-1 is a central and conserved metazoan regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation as it regulates gene expression and chromatin function via diverse mechanisms. It serves as a versatile molecular adaptor bringing together - in different combinations - promoter-specific transcription factors with a constellation of chromatin modifying activities associated with both activation and repression of transcription. HCF-1 has also revealed unusual mechanisms of post-translational regulation of protein function and protein-protein interaction, while being implicated in the regulation of active human promoters.Thus, our major recent completed studies have shown that: (i) HCF-1 associates with the large majority of active transcriptional start sites (over 5000) in proliferating HeLa cells and is associated with both activation and repression of transcription; (ii) HCF-1 is required for both early embryonic and adult cell proliferation in mice; (iii) the O-linked ß-N-acetylglucosamine transferase OGT cleaves HCF-1 in its active site but through distinct mechanisms; (iv) OGT cleavage of HCF-1 is stimulated by an HCF-1 'enhancer' element located near the site of cleavage; and (v) HCF-1 plays essential roles inembryonic development and brain-cell differentiation. We propose to continue investigating the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation by HCF-1 with diverse and integrated molecular, genetic, bioinformatic/computational, structural, and developmental approaches.Our specific goals are:1. To elucidate HCF-1 actions in the regulation of cell proliferation.2. To dissect OGT mechanisms of HCF-1 proteolysis and O-linked glycosylation.3. To reveal consequences of loss of HCF-1 function in embryogenesis and brain development.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div. I-III)	820107.0	CHF
928	Yvan Arsenijevic	University of Lausanne	Hôpital Ophtalmique Jules Gonin	2017-01-01	2019-12-31	Dissecting the role of Polycomb proteins during retinal degeneration	During the past years, our group demonstrated that several proteins involved in cell cycle regulation are expressed in different mouse models of retinal degeneration. Through our research funded by the SNF we identified the CDKs and the Polycomb component BMI1 as the key actors during the process of photoreceptor death studied in the Rd1 mouse retina: the in vivo inhibition of Bmi1 rescues around 70% of the photoreceptors and significantly preserves cone function (Zencak et al., PNAS 2013). Because Polycomb proteins regulate gene expression by chromatin modifications, other members of this family were studied. We observed that the histone methyltransferase EZH2 is expressed during the early degenerative stage and results in the methylation of H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a histone modification maintaining gene inhibition. Interestingly, the pattern of H3K27me3 mark observed in our studies correlates with that of degenerating photoreceptors. In vivo EZH2 inhibition by a chemical compound protects around 50% of photoreceptors. Thus, the major objective of this project is to identify the epigenetic mechanisms controlling cell death events with a special focus on those involving cell cycle protein regulation. The importance of EZH2 in the regulation of the photoreceptor death process will be challenged in vivo. We are currently performing ChIP-Seq studies for the different histone marks as well as for BMI1 in order to identify which genes are differently controlled by the Polycomb protein during retinal degeneration. The results will reveal candidate genes which will be correlated with the data of the EZH2 ablation studies, as well with RNA-Seq and micro-RNA array studies that will be undertaken in this project with WT, Rd1 and Rd1;Bmi1-/- mouse retina. The overall analysis should disclose which pathways are regulated by the Polycomb proteins during the process of photoreceptor loss using new algorithms we recently developed.The biology of human photoreceptor death is poorly known. Human retina explants will be cultivated with PDE6 inhibitors to induce photoreceptor death, allowing the study of human mechanisms of degeneration. The death process identified in mouse retinas will be compared with the data from the human samples. In order to model the human disease in vitro without the problem of tissue source, human iPS cell lines will be engineered by a CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing approach to knock-down the PDE6B gene. These different models combined with the results obtained with mouse material will help to identify candidate genes involved in the photoreceptor death process. The different candidates will be cloned into plasmids and challenged by electroporation into Rd1 retina explants (and then studied in vivo) to evaluate their role on the death mechanisms. These experiments will allow to link the systems involving EZH2, BMI1 and CDKs in the progression of the photoreceptor death with other pathways. Since we observed that BMI1 plays a major role in cell death control, the mechanisms regulating its actions will help to identify targets that can be relevant for therapeutic intervention.

Despite the impressive number of discoveries, associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) - even cumulatively - explain only a small fraction of the variation of highly heritable traits. The substantial gap between the heritability estimated by twin-studies and explained by GWA studies is termed as the missing heritability. Several hypotheses have been suggested for this phenomenon. Amongst those we investigate the possibilities of poor tagging of causal variants, gene-environment interactions, epigenetic modifications. Our proposed project aims at systematically investigating the following three interconnected lines of research:1.We will attempt to identify important modifiers of genetic effects, such as (a) Gene-environment (nutrition, smoking, alcohol, caffeine, age, and gender) interaction models, focussing on SNP already associated with our phenotypes of interest.(b) Parent-of-origin effects: We are currently developing a new method to distinguish such effects (even in unrelated individuals) by detecting heterogeneity in the phenotypic variance between heterozygous and homozygous individuals.2.We will devise a multi-SNP locus-association method to identify and quantify allelic heterogeneity and imperfect tagging. This method is designed to be applicable to meta-analysis summary statistics.3.We will integrate intermediate layers of information, such as metabolomics data into the standard phenotype-genotype association approach with the aim of revealing genetic cascades and increasing statistical power to detect novel associations.The proposed methodologies directly aim at the elucidation of system level genotype-phenotype links. This is a one of the most crucial steps in drug development, clinical diagnostics, and personalized medicine. The aim of the project is to yield new biological insights and practical guidelines that can assist scientists how to allocate resources in the field of genetics in the future.

Unlike CD8+ T cells, recognition of cancer cells by NK cells is independent of neo-antigens and potentiated by defects in antigen presentation, making them attractive as mechanistically distinct targets to CD8+ T cells for cancer immunotherapy. Clinical responses to NK cell-targeted immunotherapies have thus far been modest identifying a need to better understand molecular mechanisms that restrict their function. NK cells exist in a variety of different states, called functional maturation states. These have important implications for their ability to control infections and cancer. We lack an understanding of negative regulators of NK cell functional maturation, though identifying such mechanisms may provide new therapeutic targets for NK cell-based immunotherapies. BACH2 is a transcriptional repressor whose expression is predominantly restricted to lymphocytes. New data indicates that BACH2 is an intrinsic negative regulator of NK cell functional maturation with consequences for homeostasis and anti-tumour immunity. The purpose of this work is to establish the function of BACH2 in NK cells, testing the hypothesis that it is a critical negative regulator of NK cell functional maturation and testing its consequences for homeostasis and immune responses to infection and cancer. Our proposed study is organised into three aims: 1. We will determine how BACH2 affects NK cells function under normal conditions, and during influenza infection, where NK cells can contribute to both clearance and immunopathology. 2. We will examine the effect of BACH2 in restraining NK cell responses to cancer. 3. We will map the genome-wide epigenetic and transcriptional changes that occur with NK cell functional maturation and examine the component of the NK cell functional maturation programme controlled by BACH2.

931	Professor Jonathan Burns	University of Exeter	None	2018-03-01	2019-02-28	GCRF: Trauma and Adverse Childhood Experiences Springboard (TrACES)	TRACES is a collaborative programme of research between the University of Exeter (UoE) and partners in South Africa, Uganda, India, Jamaica, Guyana and Colombia focused on early life trauma (including adverse childhood experiences) and its trajectories to mental illness, substance abuse and violence-related outcomes. Early life trauma (ELT) is highly prevalent, especially within low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and is strongly associated with a wide spectrum of mental illness (including psychosis, mood and anxiety disorders, addictions, suicide and personality disorders). The major part of the global burden of these disorders is located in LMICs, yet research on the mechanisms and pathways through which ELT interacts with other aetiologies and leads to later mental illness is limited outside of high-income contexts. Research to date suggests that early trauma acts through epigenetic processes, disregulates hypothalamo-pituitaryadrenal pathways and immunological processes and disrupts cognitive-affective development. There is an urgent need to investigate these and other mechanisms within diverse geographical, social and cultural contexts so as to move forward our understanding and provide a basis for developing and testing interventions aimed at mitigating the effects of ELT and preventing consequent mental, substance and violence-related outcomes. Adopting a developmental life-course perspective and a translational approach including multidisciplinary methods (i.e. genomics and epigenomics, neuroimaging, psychopharmacology, clinical, social and spatial epidemiology, cognitive and experimental neuroscience and neuropsychology), this programme provides pump-priming funding to support collaborative workshops, network-building and pilot studies that will establish our international research platform and provide a springboard for large-scale, multidisciplinary and collaborative grant applications that will enable this ambitious programme of research.

This proposal aims to harness the potential of large-scale integrated genetic and health data to spur innovation, and develop predictive algorithms to improve clinical decision making and patient health. Specifically, this will focus on the development and evaluation of ML and DL frameworks for GWAS, and clinical risk prediction using publicly available large-scale EHR and genomics biodata resources, including UK Biobank, Genomics England and INTERVAL studies. Transcriptomic and functional data will be integrated into these using predictive approaches, where this has not been directly measured. This will be implemented in three stages: 1) assessment of complex time-dependent statistical approaches for modelling of hazard; 2) optimisation and assessment of existing ML and DL approaches for modelling of clinical risk; 3) development of novel approaches, specifically using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to incorporate temporality and missingness in clinical data, including time varying covariates to accurately model complex hazard functions; the objective of this project will be to develop approaches that appropriately leverage the rich longitudinal and time-dependent data on individuals shown by us and others to substantially improve clinical risk prediction. In addition to risk prediction, this proposal will also focus on improving our understanding of genetic aetiology of disease. In addition to standard GWAS approaches, hybrid ML and GWAS approaches for prioritisation of candidate genes, and genetic variants associated with disease will also be applied, potentially improving the power to identify novel associations, with important implications for prioritisation of therapeutic targets.

933	Dr Niels Jakobsen	University of Oxford	Weatherall Inst of Molecular Medicine	2017-10-03	2021-07-02	Molecular and Cellular Basis of Clonal Dominance in Myeloid Malignancy	Recently it has been shown that clonal haematopoiesis associated with somatic mutations is common in elderly individuals. The majority of mutations occur in genes encoding three epigenetic regulators, DNMT3A, TET2 and ASXL1, and notably mutations in the same genes are initiating events in the development of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Acquisition of one of these mutations in a haematopoietic stem or progenitor cell leads to clonal expansion and increases the risk of haematological cancer, though blood cell production is not impaired. This project aims to determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms that lead to clonal advantage in the development of myeloid malignancies. To identify the cell type which propagates this state, we will characterise primary human bone marrow samples from elderly adults with clonal haematopoiesis, and from patients with AML in disease remission. In parallel, a mouse model with an inducible Dnmt3a-R882H allele will be developed, that will allow mutant haematopoietic cells to be fate-mapped in situ. We will determine the phenotypic consequences of mutations in purified haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells - this will involve assays of proliferation, self-renewal, differentiation and lineage potential - and study how the epigenetic and transcriptional profile is altered in order to identify genes that are dysregulated in mutant cells. Comparing results from human and murine cells will allow common pathways in equivalent cell types to be identified. A shRNA dropout screen will be developed to test which of these pathways are critical to driving clonal advantage. This study will shed light on how myeloid malignancies develop, and provide general insights into cancer development and stem cell ageing. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying clonal advantage, we hope to identify a therapeutic target that would allow eradication of dominant preleukaemic clones prior to the development of fully transformed leukaemia.

In the mammalian embryo, pluripotency is a transient property that disappears as cells sequentially specialise into differentiated tissues or soma. However, a small number of primordial germ cells (PGCs) are set-aside in early development and are the founder cells of the germline, ultimately giving rise to the gametes – the sperm and egg. Despite the overt specialisation displayed by sperm and egg, it is through combining these two cell types that a new embryo, once again containing pluripotent cells, is produced in the next generation. Furthermore, PGCs are the cells of origin of testicular teratocarcinoma and when placed in culture, in the presence of certain cytokines, they can efficiently undergo conversion to pluripotent stem cells called embryonic germ (EG) cells. These cells have similar properties to embryonic stem (ES) cells derived directly from pluripotent cells in the early embryo. Therefore we have hypothesised that competence for pluripotency appears to persist – to a lesser or greater extent - throughout the germline cycle. Our lab studies the germline cycle in vivo in mammalian embryos, and also in vitro using primary culture systems and pluripotent stem cell models. By studying how pluripotency is regulated both in vivo (predominantly in the mouse) and in vitro (using mouse, rat and, increasingly, human cells) we seek to answer basic questions about the regulation of cell fate and potency. We are also interested in how germ cell development is co-ordinated with the major germline epigenetic reprogramming events, with a particularly focus on DNA methylation. We have started to develop live imaging approaches to visualise germ cells in vivo and in vitro, and we hope to use this to answer a broad range of questions including: how developmental signals influence cell potency and epigenetic processes, the role of physical factors on germ cells and the molecular mechanism of PGC migration. By studying basic questions in stem cell biology, developmental biology, epigenetics and reproduction we hope to inform the treatment of human infertility, such as by in vitro gametogenesis approaches, and more broadly impact the field of regenerative medicine. Understanding the process of teratocarcinogenesis may well inform our understanding of developmental tumours. Understanding how normal development is subverted and how aberrant cells survive and lead to tumours has the potential to impact strategies to improve treatment strategies.

Self-harm is associated with a range of adverse outcomes, including an increased risk of suicide. Yet we know little about the aetiology of this behaviour. A history of early life adversity (ELA) is one of the strongest risk factors for self-harm. Long-term health conditions typically result from a complex interplay between social environment and biology. Our research will examine the role of three key biological mechanisms (inflammation, DNA methylation, and puberty (status and timing)) in the pathway between ELA and later self-harm. This work will advance knowledge of the aetiology of self-harm, and could lead to novel approaches for risk detection, treatment and prevention. Most existing studies have focused on suicide attempts yet only a third of adolescents have harmed themselves with suicidal intent. There is increasing interest in non-suicidal self-harm, however it is uncertain whether self-harm with and without suicidal intent are different clinical entities, or part of a continuum of risk. Research has begun to explore differences in psychosocial risk factors for these behaviours, but our understanding of potential differences in their genetic architecture is limited. This work will inform future research studies of self-harm. We propose investigating these key issues for the self-harm field in the ALSPAC cohort; an on-going study of over 13,000 children followed prospectively from birth into adulthood. Participants completed a detailed self-harm questionnaire at age 16 years (N= ~5,000, self-harm prevalence 18.8%). No other cohort has such detailed life-course phenotypic information, along with genetic, epigenetic, biological, and environmental data. To address our research questions we will use appropriate statistical techniques including structural equation models, Mendelian randomisation, polygenic score analysis, and genomic-REML analysis.

Using this assay in the analyses of CSF, it was possible to distinguish correctly between patients with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer Disease, Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) and age-matched controls (figure 2 and 3). This test was developed on a triple quadrupole based mass spectral platform which allows the translation of this test into any large hospital. Preliminary metabolomic profiling of CSF in the UCL laboratories have identified potential biomarkers and differences in metabolite expression in patients with Lewy Body Dementia, Parkinson's Disease and age-matched controls (Figure below). These results indicate that there are changes in the metabolome and potentially the lipidome (brain is 60% lipid) of patients with neurodegenerative conditions. Cutting edge 'omic' techniques, a full translational test capability and well defined clinical patient samples included in WP3, will allow us to identify new biomarkers, potential disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative conditions. Ageing, Single-Carbon Metabolism, and Total Brain Atrophy in Non-Demented Elders: Ageing (table 1a), hyperhomocysteinemia (>10.53)(table Xb), and low folate (<18.67)(table xc) increase risk for total brain atrophy (Bowman et al., 2012; Bowman et al., 2013). Virtually all brain regions atrophy with age and these structural changes increase risk for cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. These data suggest that single-carbon metabolism has a role in brain aging.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	315263.0	GBP

Over 300 million chronically infected individuals are at risk of developing life-limiting liver disease. Current therapies are effective at reducing viral load but do not clear the persistent HBV DNA, leaving these patients at significant risk of viral reactivation. Following host cell entry, HBV DNA is established as a persistent episome of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). This episome serves as a template for virus transcription. It is known that HBV cccDNA recruits cellular histones but the dynamic epigenetic regulation of HBV and viral promoter usage is not understood. This project aims to dissect the temporal control of HBV transcription during de novo infection of primary human hepatocytes. The HBV epigenome at early and late stages of infection will be characterised by ChIP- and DNaseI-Seq of cccDNA to map epigenetic boundaries and the formation of regulatory elements. These data will be aligned with rigorous and time-resolved analysis of viral transcripts. Our preliminary data provide compelling evidence that the host cell transcription regulator CTCF binds the HBV genome to positively regulate enhancer activity. Using a combination of mutagenesis and shRNA methodologies to abrogate CTCF binding we will dissect the function of CTCF in the establishment and maintenance of the HBV epigenome. We also provide evidence that CTCF co-operates with the transcription regulator YY1 to stimulate enhancer activity. We aim to determine the interplay between CTCF and YY1 in the epigenetic regulation of HBV enhancer activity and virus transcription. This in-depth analysis of HBV transcription in a physiologically relevant HBV infection model, and molecular dissection of key host factors will provide a step-change in our understanding of the HBV life cycle. The outcomes of this project will impact on future anti-viral strategies that will be effective in the clearance of chronic HBV infections.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	634219.0	GBP

Tissue-specific Mendelian randomization - As an initial analysis, I will instrument genes using tissue-specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and assess putative associations using Mendelian randomization (MR) across 139 complex traits. However, as more tissue-centric expression data becomes available I will be able to assess this crucial aspect of molecular aetiology with greater confidence by instrumenting genes with multiple instruments. I also plan to expand upon the initial set of traits assessed using ~600 outcomes from the UK Biobank study as well as proteomic data. 2. Systematic two-step epigenetic MR - Building upon recent research I have led, I intend to construct a framework to assess whether genetic and environmental exposures influence complex traits via changes in DNA methylation levels. To do this I will systematically apply two-step epigenetic MR. 3. Multivariable 'omic MR - I will apply the principals of multivariable MR to assess the effect of multiple 'omic traits simultaneously on complex traits/disease. This work will also evaluate pharmaceutical targets which should be translatable for therapeutic purposes. 4. Application of novel methods to 'omic data - Future methodology in this field is likely to focus on integrative approaches, and therefore I intend to apply the most innovative and cutting-edge methods to multiple types of 'omic data, as well as iterate upon them. 5. Computational tools to disseminate the product of this fellowship - I will develop a suite of bioinformatics tools and resources to disseminate the findings and methods of this fellowship to a broad audience. Building upon experience in developing a target validation tool for industry partners, I plan to develop platforms which automate fundamental analyses in this field to large-scale data which should be of considerable value to the community and industry partners.

Cigarette smokers have specific and identifiable DNA methylation patterns. It is not known whether e-cigarette use results in a methylation pattern that is similar to that of cigarette smokers, or more similar to that of non-smokers. Furthermore, at present whether these methylation patterns are causally related to the cancers associated with smoking requires investigation. Aims This project aims 1) to ascertain whether e-cigarette use is associated with a specific epigenetic pattern of DNA methylation, 2) to evaluate the degree of overlap between methylation profiles in e-cigarette and traditional cigarette smokers (where a distinctive methylation profile is observed), 3) to ascertain whether methylation patterns in e-cigarette users discriminate normal and cancer tissue to the same extent as methylation changes associated in smokers, using data from publicly available cancer data sets, and 4) to investigate whether methylation patterns seen in smokers (and e-cigarette users if we find distinctive patterns from aims 1) and 2)) are likely to be causally associated with cancer. Method We will collect saliva samples from e-cigarette users, smokers, and non-smokers, and perform an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) using the samples. Using these data, we will compare e-cigarette users’ methylation patterns with those of smokers and non-smokers. Concurrently, we will use publicly available data to ascertain whether the methylation patterns seen in e-cigarette users might be predictive of smoking-related cancers. Furthermore, we will use Mendelian randomisation to ascertain whether the methylation patterns associated with smoking and e-cigarette use might be causally linked to cancer. How results will be used The results of this study will be of direct relevance to both health professionals and policy makers. If we find methylation patterns seen in e-cigarette users are similar to those of smokers, this might indicate that long-term cancer risk could be similar. If, conversely, e-cigarette methylation patterns are more akin to patterns seen in non-smokers, this might provide evidence that their use as a smoking-cessation device or cigarette alternative could be encouraged or promoted. The results could inform e-cigarette policy and legislation decisions.	Cancer Research UK	PRC - Project Award	None	None

Loss of RASSF1A is associated with progression and pathogenesis of solid tumours and more aggressive clinical phenotype, leading to poor prognosis in breast, lung and colon cancers amongst others. RASSF1A functions in a number of cellular processes, however,in tumours with RASSF1 promoter methylation an alternative isoform, RASSF1C, leads to differential packaging and secretion of exosomes, modulating the communication between cancer cells and increasing their tumourigenicity. We find that RASSF1C is an oncogene that plays a variety of roles in invasion, survival and extracellular communication, resulting in increased tumourigenesis. This work highlights the association of the epigenetic inactivation of the RASSF1A gene with the more aggressive, metastatic tumours, and its relation to increased cancer outcome and risk.

My group has significantly contributed to this novel research field. It is however fair to say that the role of “epigenetics” in memory function is still met with some skepticism in the neurosciences, which is in part due to the fact that many of the current studies have been describing phenomena and mechanistic data to explain how epigenetic processes control memory function in health and disease are comparatively sparse. The major objective of this research proposal is to address this issue and help to consolidate the field of neuroepigenetics by providing insight to the mechanisms by which epigenetic processes contribute to memory formation under physiological and pathological conditions. More specifically I will ask how the epigenetic code is translated into cellular changes that mediate memory formation in health and disease and how can epigenetic mechanisms contribute to the transmission of cognitive phenotypes even across generations. Our results will not only provide import insight to the mechanisms that underlie memory formation but will also lay the basis for the development of novel and improved therapies for age-related cognitive disorders.

This proposal aims to harness the potential of large-scale integrated genetic and health data to spur innovation, and develop predictive algorithms to improve clinical decision making and patient health. Specifically, this will focus on the development and evaluation of ML and DL frameworks for GWAS, and clinical risk prediction using publicly available large-scale EHR and genomics biodata resources, including UK Biobank, Genomics England and INTERVAL studies. Transcriptomic and functional data will be integrated into these using predictive approaches, where this has not been directly measured. This will be implemented in three stages: 1) assessment of complex time-dependent statistical approaches for modelling of hazard; 2) optimisation and assessment of existing ML and DL approaches for modelling of clinical risk; 3) development of novel approaches, specifically using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to incorporate temporality and missingness in clinical data, including time varying covariates to accurately model complex hazard functions; the objective of this project will be to develop approaches that appropriately leverage the rich longitudinal and time-dependent data on individuals shown by us and others to substantially improve clinical risk prediction. In addition to risk prediction, this proposal will also focus on improving our understanding of genetic aetiology of disease. In addition to standard GWAS approaches, hybrid ML and GWAS approaches for prioritisation of candidate genes, and genetic variants associated with disease will also be applied, potentially improving the power to identify novel associations, with important implications for prioritisation of therapeutic targets.

Microsatellite-unstable (MSI+) tumours are commonly found in the colon where they comprise ~15% of all cancers. MSI+ cancers can occur as a result of the familial Lynch syndrome which is caused by germline mutations in components of the mismatch repair pathway such as MSH2 and MLH1. MSI can also arise in sporadic cancers where, in the majority of cases, MLH1 is silenced by promoter methylation. Colorectal tumours arising in Lynch syndrome patients usually develop via the classical adenoma to carcinoma pathway. In contrast, sporadic MSI+ cancers develop from sessile serrated adenomas. This pathway is characterised by the presence of BrafV600E mutations and has a lower frequency of APC mutations than the classical pathway. Sporadic MSI+ cancers with BrafV600E mutations and promoter silencing of MLH1 form a significant subgroup of colorectal cancer with a good prognosis but a differential response to common chemotherapies. A greater understanding of this group of cancers is essential to develop subtype specific or targeted treatments. Germline Mlh1 mouse knockouts with and without Apc mutations have been studied and proved representative of Lynch syndrome but to date, no model of somatic Mlh1 coding mutation combined with BrafV600E mutation exists. In this proposal we aim to generate and characterise such a model using the IMPC Mlh1tm1c strain and compare it with an existing Mlh1 promoter mutation created in our laboratory. We will use these systems to investigate the initiation and progression of sporadic MSI+ tumours. Our long term goal will be to use either or both models to test existing and novel therapies, including immunological and epigenetic based approaches, in this distinct class of colorectal cancer.

Investigate how abnormal epigenetic gene regulatory mechanisms result in differentiation block and leukaemic transformation in IDHm AML. 2. Investigate the molecular mechanisms of action of mutant IDH inhibitors in inducing differentiation of AML, focusing on effects on transcription factors involved in normal granulocyte-monocyte (GM) differentiation. Methodology 1. Compare gene expression, DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility, performed in parallel (multi-genomics) in normal bone marrow versus AML. Perform unbiased genome-wide bioinformatic analysis, and analysis focused on differentially expressed transcription factors required for normal GM differentiation (GM-TFs) but suppressed in AML. 2. Test the hypothesis that failure to express GM-TFs results in leukaemic transformation using CRISPR knockdown of candidate GM-TFs in IDH1-mutant preleukaemic mouse model. 3. Perform multi-genomic sequencing on mIDHi-treated AML LSC in vitro to investigate how mIDHi upregulates GM-TFs. Identify GM-TFs upregulated with mIDHi in responsive AML samples but which remain repressed in non-responsive samples. Test if re-expression restores response in resistant AML samples. 4. Correlate GM-TFs required for response (from point 3) with gene expression in IDHm AML patients who are resistant to mIDHi treatment in vivo. These may be important targets for novel therapies. Applications and benefits This work will improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of differentiation block and its contribution to pathogenesis of AML. It will help explain why differentiation therapies may not cure patients. The data has the potential to identify new genes/ pathways that should be targeted by novel therapies to improve clinical outcomes. It will provide the rationale for design of future clinical trials of combination therapy. Multi-genomic characterisation of patients may be useful as a prognostic tool, and to guide therapeutic decisions.	Medical Research Council	Fellowship	804610.0	GBP

The development of robust blood biomarkers of exposure and early disease manifestations can be viewed as a non-invasive alternative to improve at-risk patients identification and prognosis. Novel high-throughput techniques allow reliable measurement of the cellular activity and its regulation at different molecular levels. This defines an ideal framework to seek for biomarkers of exposures through the biochemically-imprinted effects of external exposures, and biomarkers of disease risk by identifying specific molecular alterations that arise at different stages along the course of disease progression. Previous investigations have established the existence of gene expression and epigenetic signals that are involved in the physiological responses to smoking exposure and representative of lung cancer risk. Additionally, robust evidence is accumulating to support the existence of inheritable lung cancer risk determinants. However, the way these molecular signals interact to ultimately contribute to individual lung cancer risk profile remains unknown. In order to explore these complex regulatory cascades, Mechanomics will exploit, as a unique resource, a large dataset including full-resolution genetic profiles already available in (N=45,000) individuals, genome-wide blood-derived DNA-methylation (N=2,700) and gene expression (N=700 of which 300 are already available) data. The project will devise novel statistical approaches combining OMICs profiling techniques, network topologies, and longitudinal models to explore the molecular mechanisms involved in the smoking-induced cellular perturbations using the wealth of multi OMICs profiles available in healthy participants. Utilising data obtained from (nested) case control studies, we will identify which of these smoking-induced perturbations are effectively driving individual lung cancer risk. We will also use an original longitudinal model for lung cancer natural history to explicitly model genetically-driven susceptibility functions to smoking exposure and lung cancer risk. This model will be generalised to include prioritised (multi-omic) markers to predict clinical onset and the dynamics of smoking-induced lung cancer disease progression. Altogether the proposed research will help identifying functionally relevant OMICs biomarkers mediating the effect of exposure to tobacco smoke towards increased risk of lung cancer, and will potentially inform both their role in lung carcinogenesis, and their ability to predict dynamics of lung cancer progression. As such Mechanomics has the potential to contribute to improved patients early diagnosis and risk stratification.	Cancer Research UK	PRC - Project Award	None	None

Background: Cancer clones emerge and evolve through somatic mutation acquisition and Darwinian selection, but the dynamics of clonal evolution remain poorly understood and predicting disease progression remains a real challenge. Genes that regulate the epigenome are clearly important targets of mutations in cancer, but the mechanisms by which they drive tumour evolution remain unknown. The myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are haematopoietic disorders that represent an excellent model to study genomic and epigenomic evolution in human cancers: (i) They are genetically well-defined with disease driving mutations in JAK2, CALR (which I described in 2013) or MPL, present alongside mutations in epigenetic regulators, such as, DNMT3A. (ii) Disease can be either stable, or progress to leukaemia or myelofibrosis, providing the opportunity to study the basis for these evolutionary differences, and (iii) Primary cells can be serially sampled at the clonal level enabling inter- and intra-clonal studies. Aims: My key goal is to understand the genetic and epigenetic basis of clonal evolution in MPNs. Specifically, 1. I will determine the mutational patterns, mutational processes and clonal dynamics underlying disease stability versus progression. 2. I will study the aberrations in DNA methylation resulting from mutations in DNMT3A (and later TET2), at the clonal level in MPNs to understand how DNA methylation drives clonal evolution. Methods: 1. Whole-genome sequencing of 2-3 disease time-points in 32 MPN patients with either stable or progressed disease has completed. Genome-wide somatic mutations will be analysed and the absolute timing of genetic events in relation to disease phenotype will be determined using targeted sequencing of further disease timepoints. Mutational processes and clonal dynamics underlying disease evolution will be determined by studying subclonal architectures, mutational signatures and rates of mutation acquisition. 2. Whole-genome bisulphite sequencing of individual single-cell derived haematopoietic colonies will be performed in 15 DNMT3A- or TET2-mutated MPNs. Perturbations in DNA methylation across patients, between genetic subclones, between colonies of the same genotype, and within individual colonies, will address the mechanisms by which DNA methylation dysregulation contributes to clonal evolution. How the results of this research will be used: This study will provide information on why MPNs remains stable in some but unfortunately progress in others, and which patients may be at risk of future disease progression. Deciphering DNA methylation perturbations at a clonal level will provide unprecedented insight into the epigenetic mechanisms that drive clonal haematopoiesis and evolution. The evolutionary insights gained will be relevant to other cancers.	Cancer Research UK	CCC - Clinician Scientist Fellowship	None	None

In particular embryonic development is characterised by significant metabolic, epigenetic and cellular changes associated with different developmental stages, suggesting that metabolism may play a key role in regulating cell fate decisions. But until now, the precise molecular interplay between metabolism and the epigenome remains poorly understood. The main goal of this proposal is to understand the mechanisms that link metabolism with epigenetic changes and cellular potential in pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). I plan to generate a comprehensive dataset of metabolic states in human and mouse PSCs and assess the impact of induced metabolic changes on PSC potential, histone and DNA methylation, and the relevant epigenetic enzymes. Elucidating these mechanisms will reveal molecular principles involved in the regulation of the epigenome and affecting PSC potential and state. This knowledge will form the basis for novel PSC differentiation strategies for regenerative medicine and will also contribute to our understanding of metabolic disease states and aging.

How this is accomplished is an important question. We have shown that chromatin remodelling factors play an important role in the maintenance of the epigenome. Recently in collaboration with the group of Marc Veldhoen (Babraham Institute), we found that such a factor plays a role of interest in the maintenance of correct histone modification profile and gene expression in intestinal stem cells and loss of this factor leads to aberrant regulation of genes normally expressed in other tissues. Furthermore, loss of this factor leads to defects in intestinal immunity. In the proposed programme, we will examine if aging, inflammation and inflammation linked to aging (inflammaging) also lead to short and long-term changes in the epigenomes and gene expression programme of intestinal stem cells. Furthermore, using transcriptome and proteome analysis we will find out what are the mechanisms and pathways that lead to such changes. We will use the mouse as model system and will collaborate with several teams at Babraham Institute and elsewhere.	Medical Research Council	None	None	None
949	Dr Nicholas Fuggle	University of Southampton	MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit	2019-08-06	2021-08-05	Does epigenetic age acceleration predict future accelerated musculoskeletal ageing?	Background The ability to predict those at risk of adverse musculoskeletal ageing is vital if therapeutic strategies are to be successful (Kern et al., 2005). Therefore, the identification of biomarkers that capture ‘biological’ age have the potential for significant clinical utility. Epigenetic changes, specifically those within the DNA methylome, enable precise age prediction (Teschendorff et al., 2010, Rakyan et al., 2010) and ‘epigenetic clocks’ have been formulated to capture ‘biological’ ageing (Horvath, 2013). The objectives of my fellowship are: Primary aim: • To describe the longitudinal associations between epigenetic age acceleration at baseline, and musculoskeletal outcomes 10 and 17 years later. Secondary aims: • To establish the association between baseline epigenetic age acceleration and the 10 and 17 year incidence of fractures and falls. • To identify novel epigenetic patterns and individuals marks which are associated with indices of bone and muscle ageing through Epigenome-Wide Association Study. Methods My fellowship will focus on the Hertfordshire Cohort Study (HCS); a group of community-dwelling, older adults. The musculoskeletal phenotyping of the cohort I completed in 2017 included questionnaires, short performance physical battery testing, dynamometry, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), High Resolution pQCT which provided longitudinal measures of phenotyping which was performed in 2011-12. These two time-points will be used to assess the relationship between epigenetic age at baseline (1998-2001) and musculoskeletal phenotype at approximately 10 years (2011-12) and approximately 17 years (2017). DNA samples derived from whole blood leukocytes at HCS baseline (1998-2001) will be assessed for genome-wide methylation profiles (Pidsley et al., 2016). I will use epigenetic clocks (Horvath, 2013, Hannum et al., 2013) to calculate epigenetic age and age acceleration. These will be compared with musculoskeletal outcomes. In additional, exploratory analyses, I will use an epigenome-wide approach to elucidate specifc CpGs, differentially-methylated regions of interest, and patterns of CpG methylation associated with musculoskeletal outcomes. Impact The findings from this study will contribute significantly to the understanding of the relationship between epigenetics and future musculoskeletal phenotype. This will pump-prime future, post-fellowship work to investigate whether our findings are replicated in other ageing cohorts and will ultimately lead to a novel tool which incorporates epigenetic and clinical parameters to predict those at risk of adverse musculoskeletal ageing. This tool has the potential to significantly improve the predictive value of currently available tools and thus enable health resources to be targeted to those older persons with the greatest need.

CD161 is expressed on various immune cells, including newly discovered populations such as MAIT cells and innate lymphoid cells. To identify the intratumoural cells contributing to improved prognosis, I will develop a tool for the bioinformatic enumeration of pure cell types from complex populations. As chromatin accessibility and enhancer landscape reflects cell identify better than mRNA levels, differentially accessible loci will be a unique signature for each cell type. Using state-of-the-art technologies, my key goals are to: 1. Generate a comprehensive epigenetic signature matrix encompassing novel immune cell types 2. Use this to deconvolute the epigenome of colorectal carcinoma tumours 3. Directly identify the infiltrating CD161-expressing population correlated with improved survival in colorectal cancer By improving our understanding of how multiple immune populations collectively infiltrate tumours, including novel CD161-expressing cells, this work will enable future cancer immunotherapies to target protective immune subsets. Furthermore, the proposed work will provide a resource that can be easily applied to epigenetic data from other malignancies.	Wellcome Trust	Sir Henry Wellcome Postdoctoral Fellowship	250000.0	GBP

These disorders are incurable and their underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Intriguingly, varying symptom severity has been described in patients with the same causative mutations for a number of these disorders and phenotypes displayed in some mouse models are strain-dependent. To search for secondary mutations that suppress phenotypes in mouse models of the neurological disorder, Rett syndrome, Monica Justice’s lab performed a genome-wide screen by inducing random mutations with the chemical mutagen ENU. I aim to take advantage of recent advances in CRISPR/Cas9 technology to develop a CRISPR-based screening method. This method will simplify isolation of modifying mutations, greatly reduce the number of animals required and can be adapted for recessive screening. I will use this method to screen for suppressors of two neurological disorders that are predicted to be modifiable: ATR-X and ADNP syndromes. Both causative genes encode epigenetic proteins: ATRX is a chromatin remodelling ATPase and ADNP is a putative transcription factor. I hope that the ‘hits’ obtained in these screens will help us to better understand ATRX/ADNP protein function and open up therapeutic avenues for patients.

952	Dr Michael Clynes	University of Southampton	None	2019-01-02	2021-01-02	Does epigenetic age acceleration predict future musculoskeletal outcomes?	Musculoskeletal ageing places older individuals at an increased risk of falls, fractures, and higher consequent morbidity and mortality. Recent developments in the field of epigenetics have led to the development of epigenetic clocks which provide a measure of biological age. The relationship between rates of biological ageing (as measured by these clocks) and future musculoskeletal phenotype and consequent risks of fractures and falls is not known. The aim of this study is therefore to investigate the association between epigenetic age acceleration at baseline and areal bone mineral density, bone microarchitecture, grip strength and physical performance and the incidence of falls and fractures at two future time points (approximately 10- and 17- years).

Recent data show that obesity and related disorders are induced by both fast childhood weight gain, and by formula feeding that promotes higher weight gain than breastfeeding. Lower protein in infant formula at levels similar to breast milk normalizes early weight gain and reduces later obesity risk as much as 2.5fold. Optimizing growth through improved substrate supply is of major importance for health prevention, but information is lacking on key mediators, effects on body composition and mechanisms of action, e.g. epigenetic modification. We use innovative approaches to identify key substrates that may mediate growth and body composition in humans, e.g. branched chain amino acids, n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and others, and their epigenetic effects. We employ novel methods for high throughput targeted metabolomic and lipidomic profiling, genome-wide DNA methylation analysis, and state of the art bioinformatics. These powerful tools are applied to five well designed prospective cohort studies covering critical time periods from pregnancy to puberty. All cohorts offer precise phenotyping incl. body composition and are already or will be established. Comparative analyses across studies and populations provide added scientific value. We will identify which metabolic signals induce rapid weight gain and body fat deposition throughout childhood. We aim at identifying susceptible age periods, nutrient effects on epigenetic DNA methylation, and whether early metabolic exposures induce persistent or fluid metabolomic and epigenetic changes over time. The results should provide answers to key questions on the regulation of growth, with major benefit for scientific understanding, opportunities for future research, promotion of public health, nutrition recommendations, and development of improved food products.

A linked dataset combining information from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) register will be created. About 280,000 babies, born 1991-2009, and their mothers, who are registered at GP practices in England, will be included. Duration of follow-up varies from a few months to over 20 years, depending on date of delivery. The main 'exposure' is ART, which comprises IVF, ICSI, and ovulation induction; other techniques (e.g. blastocyst transfer) will be examined, where possible. Outcome data include all consultations, diagnoses, prescriptions and referrals recorded by GPs, supplemented by data on hospital episodes and mental health treatment. Key outcomes for children include growth, illness and infection, atopic and allergic conditions, behaviour and developmental outcomes; and for mothers, physical and mental health. Multivariable regression models will be used to estimate adjusted rate ratios and odds ratios as appropriate, comparing outcomes in the ART and non-ART groups. An economic analysis will compare differences in NHS expenditure on the long-term provision of care for ART and non-ART pairs, and model future costs. Concern among researchers that low consent rates since 2009 adveresly affect the representativeness of the HFEA dataset, means that the newest data are under-utilised. Methodological work to explore the impact of missingness, and to develop methods to reduce the potential bias, will be conducted. Qualitative research, exploring patients' decisions to consent (or not) to studies of ART will also be completed, through face-to-face interviews and thematic analysis. This study will contribute to the evidence for the safety and costs of ART in England, and provide tools for future work using these rich data sources.

The aetiology of schizophrenia involves both genetic vulnerability and several environmental risk factors, of which the most preventable is cannabis use. It is therefore important to establish a) the patterns of exposure to cannabis that are especially likely to provoke psychosis, and b) who is especially vulnerable. My study will build on a large epidemiological EU-FP7 study of first onset psychosis for which I designed the interview regarding drug use. I will examine: a) GWAS and cannabis use data from 2,000 cases and 2,000 controls; b) baseline peripheral blood EWAS data from a subset of cases and controls (N=800) with additional genome-wide RNA data (N=600). The London participants will be followed up at a mean of 5 years and re-sampled for longitudinal EWAS (N=600) and RNA(N=400)profiling analyses. My aims are to: 1. Develop a simple method of assessing patterns of cannabis use which best predict the development of a cannabis-associated psychosis, and so enable identification of those individuals most at risk of a) psychosis onset and b) poor outcome. 2. Establish the proportion of psychosis cases attributable to cannabis use in 5 European countries. 3. Using the GWAs data, to determine the effectiveness of combining Schizophrenia Polygenic Risk scores, including Pathway-informed ones, with information on cannabis use in order to predict a)risk of developing a psychotic disorder; b)clinical and functional outcome 5 years following onset of psychosis. 4. Carry out longitudinal-multidimensional GWAS-guided analyses of a)EWAS and b)genome-wide RNA expression data to identify pathways involved in cannabis-associated psychosis. My work will establish a)those patterns of cannabis use which best predict psychosis, b)easily accessible biological markers of susceptibility to the effect of cannabis in provoking the onset and persistence of psychosis. It will be useful in developing better tailored preventative strategies and may indicate new drug targets.	Medical Research Council	Fellowship	1004670.0	GBP

Unfortunately, current simulation procedures present two major problems, which handicapped their use: i) classical force-fields present well known biases, which limit their accuracy; ii) current atomistic procedures are limited to study systems in the range of 100 base pairs (around 34 nm long), while the DNA of the simplest prokaryotic organisms is one billion times larger. The main objective of this proposal is the development of a multiscale simulation technology for the study of DNA, which will cover, with different levels of resolution, but with the same physical roots, the entire range of DNA scales, from nucleobase (Ǻ-scale) to the human genome (m-scale). Our roadmap will start for the development of a polarized force-field which will be parametrized against a variety of experimental and theoretical data. In a second stage, we will analyze a very large number of DNA sequences in different epigenetic and packing states and we will create a MoDEL-like database of DNA trajectories. In a third stage we will derive coarse grained and essential dynamic-based strategies for ultra-fast accurate simulations for medium to long segments of DNA. In the last stage of this project we will develop a new mesoscopic model, which will go beyond the harmonic nearest-neighbors model, accounting for multi-modality, for neutralization-induced deformations, and for changes in DNA properties related to epigenetic changes. Using these models we expect to analyze fine details of (human) genome structure and regulation, trying to reach the connection point between physical properties of DNA, chromatine structure, epigenetic signatures and gene regulation	European Research Council	Advanced Grant	1961400.0	EUR
957	Prof. Eric Vivier	Université d'Aix-Marseille	None	2011-07-01	2016-07-01	The Immune function of NK cells	In this project, we propose to explore a new area in biological research aiming at dissecting emerging of properties of the innate immune responses. Our system model is the Natural Killer (NK) cell. Specifically, we will investigate the mechanisms by which these players of innate immunity achieve tolerance to self and participate to immune responses. Multidisciplinary approaches will be combined to achieve groundbreaking results at nanoscopic and macroscopic scales on the following issues:- How NK cells are educated to self-tolerance?- How NK cells distinguish their targets from normal cells?- How NK cells participate to immunological memory?THINK (THe Immune function of Natural Killer cells) is a challenging project supported by an array of preliminary data obtained by our team of investigators in various fields of expertise:- innate immunity and NK cells in human and mouse models- random insertional mutagenesis in the mouse- genome-wide epigenetic, transcriptomic and RNAi analysis and - state-of-the-art optical imaging techniques from intravital biphoton microscopy to the quantification of proteins in nano-sized areas of the cell. THINK is thus a multidisciplinary project that bridges disciplines: immunology, biophysics, genetics and epigenetics. In a scientific perspective, we think that this project will open new technological and scholar horizons, in reassessing the actual concepts on the links between innate immunity, tissue homeostasis and stress response. In a clinical and translational perspective, we also think that this project will help to design innovative NK cell-based therapies and immunomonitoring protocols.

958	Dr. Kate Duffus	University of Manchester	None	2016-10-01	2019-09-30	Granville Hugh King Foundation Fellowship - Elucidating the genetic mechanisms of disease-associated enhancer variants in rheumatoid arthritis	There has been tremendous success in determining the genetic component of susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with over 100 loci identified. For the majority, the causal variants and their target genes remain unknown. Over 80% of associated variants fall in non-coding regions with evidence of enrichment within cell-specific enhancer elements. The 3D structure of chromatin, facilitates physical interaction between enhancers and their target promoters. Chromosome conformation techniques (3C, HiC) can be used to capture these interactions thus helping to identify the true target genes of RA associated variants. I have selected three putative disease-associated enhancer loci (near RAD51B, ANKRD55 and STAT4) from pilot capture Hi-C data for investigation. Although compelling, the interactions detected in the pilot data have been generated in unstimulated T and B cell lines, and so may not be the only, or most relevant, interactions in the pathophysiology of RA. Here I will investigate these findings, using more focussed 3C analysis, in both unstimulated and stimulated primary T and B cells. Crucially I will also relate this physical interaction to the consequences on gene transcription, using nascent nuclear RNA expression analysis, and also link to DNA activity, using epigenetic marks, all in a genotype specific context.

959	Dr Konstantinos Tzelepis	University of Cambridge	None	2018-08-01	2022-08-01	The role of RNA modifications in myeloid leukaemogenesis	Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a devastating cancer with a long-term survival below 30% for which mainstream treatments remain unchanged for several decades. Advances in genomics have highlighted the importance of epigenetic corruption in both initiating and maintaining the disease, making the epigenome an important therapeutic focus. Recently, using CRISPR-Cas9 recessive genetic screens, we identified several RNA-binding/modifying proteins as essential for AML cell survival. We have since confirmed that the RNA methyltransferase METTL3 is required for AML maintenance through its role in co-transcriptional N6 adenosine methylation of target RNAs, but is dispensable for normal haematopoiesis proposing it as a novel “druggable” therapeutic target in AML (Barbieri, Tzelepis et al, Nature 2017). Here, I propose to extend the investigation of the epitranscriptome as a new therapeutic focus in AML by studying promising AML-essential RNA-binding/modifying proteins, including METTL1 and METTL16, using unique reagents and expertise as well as access to clinically relevant bespoke models and human samples.

I have recently shown a disproportionate large contribution from low-frequency genetic variants in ALS. ALS is not simply a collection of unique rare diseases with a monogenetic cause nor is it a diagnostic continuum with a complex contribution of thousands of small effect factors. ALS is in-between, which I call “simplex”, where in each patient a few, considerably strong genetic factors with or without environmental factors are at play. ALS mutations are characterized by reduced penetrance, variable clinical expressivity, have specific pleiotropic clinical features and interact with environmental factors. These phenomena are unexplained, but provide me with important and new opportunities in order to unravel the clinical, genetic and biological heterogeneity in ALS. I have created new research fields to go an important step beyond the state of the art: Splitting by lumping uses novel machine learning algorithms to reclassify patients using clinical pleiotropic features, environmental factors and blood epigenetic profiles to identify novel ALS mutations. Imaging genomics overlays patterns in ALS-associated brain morphology on MRI with brain gene-expression patterns to find ALS mutations. ALS risk in 3D integrates data on three-dimensional folding of DNA with genetic data to identify causal mutations and mutation-to-mutation interaction. ALS genomic modifiers in 3D identifies modifiers of C9orf72 mutations through the development of cellular reporter assays and CRISPR-Cas9 based screens. Genomic findings are translated using cellular models which can be used for targeted and unbiased drug screens. If successful, my approaches can be applied beyond the scope of this ERC and will have a clear impact on clinical trial design and genetic counselling in ALS in particular.

961	Dr Ben Bar-Sade	TECHNION - ISRAEL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY	None	2018-07-01	2018-08-01	Epigenetic instability in female mice ovaries as a result of pre-pubertal immunological stress	Background Epigenetic instability can be determined by altered DNA methylation patterns as a result of environmental stress. DNA methylation patterns are normally considered stable and with high concordance between the two cytosines of a CpG/CpG pair (CpG dyads) on complementary DNA strands. There is strong evidence for epigenetic instability in the hemi-methylation of CpG dyads, which could have an impact on dividing cell populations, as the methylation pattern is copied during cell division . The ovary is composed of a finite number of primordial follicles; each follicle being defined as an oocyte surrounded by supporting cells. As the female reaches puberty, a group f follicles start to develop each month by proliferation of the supporting cells and growth of the oocyte . Thus epigenetic instability in the primordial follicles of a young female might remain in the developing follicles of the mature female, alter gene expression and ultimately interfere with the reproductive function. We have established a mouse model for early life immunological stress in which young female mice were treated with DSS to induce temporal colitis. We noticed that the treated mice had a delay in puberty onset and larger litter sizes compared to controls. RNA-seq analysis indicated 125 genes in the ovary whose mRNA levels were significantly different between treated and untreated mice. These findings, together with the mentioned epigenetic instability lead us to consider that female mice who encountered an immunological stress at young age possibly have changes in their DNA methylation pattern, which might be reflected as increased hemi-methylation of CpG dyads. Dr Reinhard Stöger and colleges have established the hairpin bisulfite PCR method to analyze DNA methylation states of CpG/CpG dyads on both strands of individual DNA molecule. The hairpin bisulfite PCR method can be used for assessing the epigenetic instability of the DSS treated mice and the controls. Hypothesis: The promoter region of genes whose expression levels altered in the ovaries of female mice who encountered immunological stress at young age will have an increased hemi-methylation of CpG dyads compared to controls. Aim and method: Determine the methylation status of both DNA strands of the promoter region and the complimentary locus of genes that have already shown differences in their mRNA levels between the ovaries of DSS treated mice and controls. This will be performed by the hairpin bisulfite PCR method for the genes: Srd5a1, Zdhhc21, Pkib and Akap10. Importance: Determining the methylation pattern of specific genes that are influenced by environmental conditions will contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms that control reproductive function variability in women.

Embryonic Stem Cells (ESC) provide an excellent cellular model to quantitatively define the principles of gene regulation at the biochemical and (epi)genetic level. In SysStemCell, I will focus on two distinct mouse pluripotent cell states. My recent studies have shown that the epigenome and transcriptome of ESCs maintained in serum-free medium complemented with two kinase inhibitors and LIF (‘2i ESC’) are distinct from classical ESCs cultured in the presence of serum and LIF (‘serum ESC’). Importantly, the 2i ESCs reflect pre-implantation stage ICM cells whereas the widely studied serum cells reflect post-implantation ESCs. These two distinct pluripotent states are interconvertible in vitro, providing an unique and accessible model to explore the regulation of the pre- to post-implantation phase of early embryonic development. I will combine state-of-the-art proteomics and chromatin-based methods, including a novel in vivo UV femtosecond laser crosslinking approach, and in depths bioinformatics in an iterative manner to define the full compendium of transcription (co)factors (TF) and TF-modules that define the two cell states. The dynamics of long- and short-range interactions between these modules will be assessed and correlated with the epigenetic state and chromatin structure. Novel and existing factors will be assessed for their role in differentiation from 2i to serum and reverse programming using knockout and forced expression strategies. Collectively, my studies will provide an invaluable resource for the community and a deep insight in the mechanisms and general principles that orchestrate gene expression in particular in the hitherto unexplored transition at implantation during early mouse development.

963	Dr Paula Pritchett	MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology	None	2018-04-01	2021-03-31	NPIF Rutherford Fellowship	Next generation sequencing is now routine, with throughput per sequencing lane running to gigabases of DNA sequence, and rising. This capacity allows hundreds of genomes to be sequenced, and polymorphisms or altered epigenetic modifications identified. It also enables the transcription or translation profiles of healthy or diseased cells or tissues to be characterized, using RNA seq and ribosome profiling respectively. For many biologists, this extraordinary power is constrained by a lack of bioinformatics skills to analyse these data. My work bridges this gap. I continuously develop turnkey computational pipelines that enable such analyses, including statistical evaluation of the data obtained. I use these pipelines to analyse data from different labs at LMB. A further goal I have is to teach biologists at LMB how these pipelines work, and where appropriate, to give them the ability and confidence to use them independently. Below, I give an overview of one current project. Animals respond to environmental stimuli by altering their behaviour. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-established model to study how nervous systems coordinate such behavioural changes. The genetic tools available in this animal, and the ultrastructural description of its nervous system provide unique opportunities to link the molecular and circuitry bases of behaviour. One sophisticated C. elegans behaviour is aggregation. The de Bono lab has used forward genetic screens to identify hundreds of mutant strains with defects in this behaviour. Each strain contains ~ 100 de novo mutations. A challenge is to identify which one mutation (it is almost always only one) causes the selected behavioural phenotype. To address this issue, I am designing and optimising a fully-automated bioinformatics pipelining tool that uses Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data from all mutant strains in an integrated way in order to filter out background mutations and pinpoint the genomic location of the causal mutation. Mutations selected by the pipeline will then be validated experimentally. I expect that this new bioinformatics tool will be available for all projects involving the detection of nucleotide variants, independently of the model organism chosen or the phenotype studied.

We currently think that stem cells change their chromatin accessibility patterns in a different manner in each differentiation lineage. The regulation of this process is of fundamental importance for regenerative medicine and reprogramming and its deregulation causes human disease and cancer. However, how stem cells orchestrate these changes to activate multiple differentiation programs into a myriad of cell types is still unknown. Planarians are an ideal model organism to investigate this question as their stem cells constantly differentiate into all cell types to turn over their tissues. The advent of single cell technologies, together with the properties of the planarian model, will enable this research now. We have already applied single cell transcriptomics to planarian stem cell differentiation, revealing for the first time their full differentiation lineage tree. Here I propose to measure chromatin interactions and accessibility at the single cell level in the bulk cell population of the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea. By using and combining Chromatin Conformation Capture techniques to monitor chromatin interactions and single cell ATAC-seq to measure chromatin accessibility we will elucidate the changes in chromatin accessibility that take place during stem cell differentiation into each differentiated cell lineages and their order. By measuring chromatin accessibility after knocking down candidate conserved regulators, we will be able to detect the chromatin changes they induce, the genomic regions where they happen and the differentiation lineages where they are needed. Since many of the genes involved are conserved from humans to planarians, this knowledge will inform human stem cell therapies and regenerative medicine. This will lay a cornerstone into our understanding of the epigenetic bases that regulate stem cell differentiation to multiple cell types.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	454410.0	GBP

Our emphasis is on biological phenomena involving concerted changes in phenotype, such as cell differentiation and activation, and on the role of DNA regulatory elements such as enhancers in these processes. We combine experimental approaches (including genome-wide assays of chromatin state, enhancer-promoter contacts and gene expression) with advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to study these questions, focusing on human cells and taking advantage of genetic and epigenetic variation as ‘natural perturbations’ in this system. Our research builds on the foundations of our previous work on promoter-enhancer relationships, organisation of DNA regulatory elements and population genomics. Our goal is to delineate the ‘ground rules’ of gene regulation and, on their basis, generate functional models of gene control networks underlying transcriptional decisions. Interrogation and validation of these models will pinpoint key individual players (genes, DNA regulatory elements, extrinsic signals) and their regulatory relationships, as well as shed light on how they are affected in disease.

966	Dr. Bernhard ENGLINGER	Medical University of Vienna	None	2019-04-01	2021-03-31	Single-cell RNA-sequencing of pediatric ependymoma	Scientific background and hypothesis of the project: Pediatric ependymoma constitutes a heterogeneous set of tumors affecting the neuroepithelial linings of the entire central nervous system. Especially high-grade subtypes are frequently refractory to chemotherapy and lead to poor overall outcomes for patients. Genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic profiling has revealed distinct molecular subgroups associated with high tumor aggressiveness, most frequently arising in children and adolescents. However, besides few exceptions, targetable oncogenic driver mutations and pathways still remain unidentified and molecular insights into ependymoma biology have yet resulted in only little progress in the clinical management of this disease. Thus, novel targets for systemic treatment of ependymoma urgently need to be identified. However, this endeavor is complicated by the rarity of this disease, its genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity, as well as the low abundance of recurrent genetic mutations, even in those subtypes exhibiting poor prognosis. One major shortcoming of the field is that the majority of current large-scale profiling is performed on bulk tumor tissue, obscuring its heterogenic make-up at single-cell level with regard to mutations/programs orchestrating key oncogenic proliferation, self-renewal, invasion, and chemo-resistance traits. Scientific innovation and originality of the proposed project: This project aims to interrogate the cellular architecture and the interplay between genetic mutations and transcriptional programs of ependymoma at unprecedented resolution, using single-cell transcriptomics. The leading expertise in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) in the applicant’s receiving institution will be leveraged to analyze single cells from fresh surgical specimen of the major molecular ependymoma subgroups. Matched patient-derived cell models will be used to functionally test putative targetable driver alterations identified by scRNA-seq, employing pharmacological or genome-editing technologies. Successful completion of this project will provide insight into ependymoma pathogenesis and to reveal novel oncogenic driver alterations of this disease at a resolution not achievable by conventional bulk tissue characterization. These insights are expected to catalyze the discovery of novel molecular targets for systemic ependymoma treatment to improve clinical management of this pediatric malignancy. Methods: Patient tumor specimen will be prepared and sorted as single-cell suspensions for full-length, whole-transcriptome scRNA-seq. Computational analysis tools will be used for bioinformatic work-up of intratumoral heterogeneity and to compare single-cell- with bulk tumor transcriptome/genomic- data. In vitro cultures of matched patient-derived cell models will be tested by pharmacological and CRISPR-Cas9-directed gene editing intervention. Primary responsible researchers of the project: Bernhard Englinger, PhD, the project applicant, will be the principal person conducting the proposed project. Mariella Filbin, MD, PhD, will be the project supervisor at the receiving institution (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston). Johannes Gojo, MD, PhD, at Medical University of Vienna will be the main collaborator coordinating the sharing of Vienna-originating patient material.

967	Dr. Leonie-Helen BOGL	Medical University of Vienna	None	2019-04-08	2021-04-07	Maternal diet during pregnancy and offspring obesity	Animal studies suggest that maternal diet during pregnancy influences susceptibility to obesity in the next generation. One-carbon nutrients involved in epigenetic processes represent a possible underlying mechanism. Unfortunately, there is limited research in humans to support animal findings about maternal diet during the period surrounding pregnancy and obesity risk in the offspring, and the few studies available have been limited to birth defects and weight outcomes in early infancy. The proposed project aims to fill this important knowledge gap by utilizing existing data from the ongoing well-established Nurses’ Health Study 2 (NHS2) and Growing Up Today Study 2 (GUTS2) cohorts. The overall objective of this proposal is to examine the associations between maternal diet quality and the intake of one-carbon nutrients (vitamin B6, vitamin B12, methionine and folate) during the period surrounding pregnancy and weight outcomes in the offspring. The hypothesis is that children born to mothers with lower adherence to healthful dietary patterns and inadequate (very low or high) intakes of one-carbon nutrients have less favorable early life somatotypes, a larger waist circumference and a higher body mass index compared to children of mothers with higher adherence to healthful dietary patterns and adequate intakes of one-carbon nutrients. The prospective NHS2 and GUTS2 cohorts provide a unique resource of dietary and lifestyle data of both the mothers and their children with a long follow-up period and a large number of mother-child pairs. The sample for the proposed analyses includes all children in GUTS2 who were born full term and whose mother’s filled in the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) during or around pregnancy. The analyses will be carried out among 4,823 children whose mothers filled in the FFQ during the 4 years surrounding pregnancy and among 1,350 children whose mother filled in the FFQ during the time they were pregnant specifically with them. Dietary information was collected by a validated 131-item FFQ and both a priori and a posteriori dietary patterns were derived. The mothers were also asked whether they use multivitamins and other nutrient supplements and if so, the brand, dose, and frequency of use. Anthropometric data of the GUTS2 children have been assessed at multiple time points and the cohort has now entered adulthood. I will be responsible for coordinating the research and conducting the statistical analyses and for drafting scientific manuscripts for publication in well-known, high-impact international peer-reviewed journals. The project is planned for a period of 2 years and will be carried out at the Medical University of Vienna, Center for Public Health, Department of Epidemiology and includes research visits to the Channing Division of Network Medicine at Harvard Medical School – home of the NHS2 and GUTS2 cohorts. I will be mentored by an experienced team of epidemiologists from both research institutes. This research is important because it could potentially provide novel strategies for interventions with the ultimate goal to break the intergenerational cycle of obesity.

While master regulators that activate gene networks during development are well characterized, the mechanisms that terminally repress alternative fates remain poorly understood. Within this project, I aim to demonstrate that active terminal repression is a universal mechanism required to prevent loss of cell identity and disease. We recently found that the neuron-specific transcription repressor Myt1l is essential to induce neuronal cell identity. Myt1l is expressed in virtually all neurons throughout life and its loss in mature neurons impairs neuronal gene expression and function, suggesting a role in maintaining cell fate. Unlike known repressors such as REST that specifically silences neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells, Myt1l represses many non-neuronal programs in neurons. I therefore propose that a new class of terminal repressor exists that continuously represses alternative lineages to confer and maintain cell identity. Since Myt1l mutations often occur in autism and schizophrenia I will investigate how loss of terminal repression can contribute to these poorly understood but common mental disorders. This will require molecular and behavioural studies in human and mouse models. We will also investigate how a sequence specific terminal repressor biochemically interacts with general epigenetic machinery to continuously silence unwanted programs during neuronal reprogramming. Finally, we will test candidate terminal repressors in other lineages by loss and gain of function approaches to analyse whether terminal repression is a universal principle of biology. Ultimately this will provide insight into fighting diseases associated with loss of cell identity and to efficiently generate cells for regenerative medicine using reprogramming.

Though management of high glucose levels at this late stage of pregnancy is a routine practice, it does not abolish the risk to the mother and the baby. Our project aims to detect women at higher risk of GDM early in pregnancy by studying DNA methylation changes as potent biomarkers.

Although the exact cause remains unknown, this immune-mediated disease is likely triggered by environmental factors in genetically predisposed individuals. I propose that epigenetic mechanisms, which regulate gene expression without affecting the genetic code, mediate the processes that cause MS and that aberrant epigenetic states can be corrected, spearheading the development of alternative therapies. We will exploit the stable and reversible nature of epigenetic marks, in particular DNA methylation, to gain insights into the novel modifiable disease mechanisms by studying the target organ in a way that has not been possible before. This highly ambitious project comprises three synergistic facets formulated in specific aims to: (i) identify epigenetic states that characterize the pathogenesis of MS, (ii) prioritize functional epigenetic states using high-throughput epigenome-screens, and (iii) develop novel approaches for precision medicine based on correcting causal epigenetic states. Our unique MS biobank combined with cutting-edge methodologies to capture pathogenic cells and measure their functional states provides a rational starting point to identify MS targets. I will complement this approach with studies of the functional impact of MS targets using innovative in vitro screens, with the added value of unbiased discovery of robust regulators of specific MS pathways. Finally, my laboratory has extensive experience with animal models of MS and I will utilize these powerful systems to dissect molecular mechanisms of MS targets and test the therapeutic potential of targeted epigenome editing in vivo. Our findings will set the stage for a paradigm-shift in studying and treating chronic inflammatory diseases based on preventing and modulating aggressive immune responses by inducing self-sustained reversal of aberrant epigenetic states.

971	Dr Kalaivani Raju	MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology	None	2017-11-01	2020-10-31	NPIF Rutherford Fellowship	During replication, DNA is unwound to expose single strands as a template for DNA synthesis. However, the propensity of single stranded DNA to form secondary structures poses a challenge to the smooth progression of the replication fork. Certain sequences are particularly prone to secondary structure formation, for instance G quadruplexes (G4) and triple helix forming DNA (H-DNA). Accumulating evidence suggests these structures form readily during replication in vertebrate cells, but are actively countered by a complex network of enzymes. Over 700,000 sites in the human genome are capable of G4 formation, so these structures pose challenges to replication forks potentially as frequently as naturally occurring DNA damage. Moreover, failure to maintain processive replication at secondary structures is associated with both genetic and epigenetic instability. However, the full range factors that promote secondary structure resolution during vertebrate replication is not known, and the in vivo coordination of existing enzymes and the forms of secondary structures upon which they act is also poorly understood. This project will investigate this area using a combination of RNAseq in mutants of known factors, and which have had secondary structures artificially inserted, as well as techniques that identify the location of R-loops (DNA-RNA hybrid triple helixes that may be formed in association with other secondary structures) to provide a comprehensive view of how these challenging DNA replication impediments occur and how they are handled. This will be ultimately important for understanding the circumstances under which structure-forming DNA sequences contribute to human pathology, for example in inherited syndromes, such as Werner or Bloom syndrome, or in cancer, in which replication stress may lead to widespread dysregulation of gene expression.

DREAM will evaluate the efficacy and safety of free-feeding allergic infants with commercially available partially hydrolyzed milk formula (pHF). We hypothesise that pHF will facilitate CMA resolution faster than routine care (extensively Hydrolyzed Formulae - eHF) and will also induce tolerance where CMA would have otherwise persisted.Immediate CMA is one of the most frequent food allergies in children with prevalence in infancy of 1.8%-7.5% and with a significant impact on QOL and health expenditure. There is no satisfactory treatment and management consists of cow’s milk (CM) avoidance feeding with ‘hypoallergenic’ formulas (eHFs) emergency management of accidental reactions and waiting for CMA to resolve naturally (spontaneously). Feeding with processed CM products is also supported but this is an empiric approach. The only potentially curative approach is Oral ImmunoTherapy (OIT) i.e. exposing patients to strictly-controlled increasing doses of CM but this is not used in clinical practice due to risk of reactions.In the recent literature a novel paradigm suggests that allergy may be treated via early allergen exposure. To evaluate whether exposure to the processed CM proteins in pHF can facilitate CMA resolution we will initially stratify infants by pHF reactivity and those who do not react to pHF will be randomised into blinded pHF/eHF free-feeding for a year; those who react will be randomised to be desensitized to pHF or eHF via a short OIT regimen before being fed freely. At the end a double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge to CM (DBPCFC) the gold standard rule of diagnosis will determine whether CMA has resolved.Numerous trials have shown that early feeding with normal/processed (baked) CM facilitates tolerance. We propose three important breakthroughs: 1. targeting young (6-12-month-old) infants when the immune system is more amenable to manipulation; 2. free-feeding in contrast to strict OIT dosing schedules; and 3. using a formula with reduced allergenicity to improve safety. Tissue samples will be stored for future research into tolerance development through antigen-dependent epigenetic modification of key regulatory genes the influence of microbiome maturation and the effect of key immune-active cytokines.Trial duration is 5 years recruitment duration is 3 years and each patient will participate for 1 year. The Trial team includes five UK academic partners a UK-wide Charity (Anaphylaxis Campaign) and the Liverpool Clinical Trials Unit. The sponsor is the Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust and there will be 12 UK recruitment centres. Nutricia-Danone will provide the pHF and eHF formulas. Extensive early PPI activities have involved the patients/public in identifying and prioritizing the research question in designing the study and in developing the grant proposal; robust PPI has also been planned for the Trial’s delivery. Dissemination will be conducted through the network of Anaphylaxis Campaign the partners’ institutions and the industry and the impact is expected to be substantial from several perspectives (including clinical scientific socioeconomic financial and industrial aspects).

Samples will be processed immediately for epithelial cell purification using magnetic bead sorting and generation of intestinal organoids according to established protocols. DNA and RNA will be extracted simultaneously. NLRC5 promoter DNA methylation analyses will be performed using bisulfite pyrosequencing and expression of NLRC5 as well as MHC-I related genes tested using RT-PCR and western blotting. Exposure of organoids to IFN-gamma will determine the impact of DNA methylation on the inducibility of MHC-I signaling. Locus specific, targeted de-methylation will be performed using a CRISPR/Cas9 based method and correlation between DNA methylation and clinical phenotype investigated using various computational approaches. Objective 2: We will generate NLRC5 knock-out and over-expressing human gut organoids using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and piggyBac transposon-based vector system respectively. Organoids from healthy individuals obtained from 2 gut segments will be modified and co-cultured with IFN-gamma. Following, we will perform genome wide expression (RNAseq) and proteomic Tandem Mass Tag profiling on organoids. Generated data will be analysed using novel computational methods such as diffusion-based approaches, which will allow identification of NLRC5 and/or IFN-gamma dependant signalling pathways operative in the human intestinal epithelium. Objective 3: In order to assess the functional impact of NLRC5 expression and MHC-I signaling on the intestinal epithelium in health and CD we will test intestinal epithelial barrier by measuring Transepithelial Electrical Resistance and efflux of FITC-dextran across organoids grown as monolayers. Additionally, we will test innate host response to viral infections and co-culture blood derived CD8+ T-cells with gut organoids and study their interaction using two-photon microscopy.

These exposures can be separated into two groups, environmental exposures, and pharmacological interventions. Murine pregnancies will be subjected to chronic toxic insults and analysis will be performed on the exposed offspring. A series of mouse reporter lines will be utilised that enable the longitudinal in vivo tracking of epigenetic change. This is achieved through the knocking in of a bioluminescent reporter into the 3’ UTR of a series of imprinted genes, whose expression is regulated in a well-defined epigenetic, parent-of-origin specific manner. A series of studies have demonstrated that these genes can be sensitive to gestational environmental exposures, resulting in mis-expression of the reporter in exposed offspring. These methods will be employed in addition to more traditional genomics techniques to identify regions of the genome that are exquisitely sensitive to toxic insult. Particular focus will be played to the persistence of any changes that occur as the exposed offspring age, and whether these changes are transmitted to subsequent generations. Mechanistic information will be garnered through comparison of diverse toxic insults and their impact on sensitive regions of the genome. These studies will provide novel information on the extent and lasting impact of toxic exposures during pregnancy. With the mechanistic information. In the longer term this research will help in the development of clear and well-informed Pregnancy Prevention Plans for tested drugs, particularly for those where there are no or only limited alternatives which remains a priority.

We have little understanding however of the mechanisms by which epigenetic information, specifically histone post-translational modifications in nucleosomes, are replicated in parallel to the DNA prior to cell division. This process strictly depends on proper nucleosome formation on the newly synthesized DNA strands. Here, I will study the molecular mechanism of nucleosome assembly during DNA replication. Nucleosome dynamics during DNA replication is controlled by an interconnected network of histone chaperones that converges on the key Chromatin Assembly Factor 1 (CAF-1). I recently elucidated the molecular mechanism of CAF-1-mediated nucleosome assembly, in absence of any other replication components. I developed a quantitative (NAQ) assay that allows, for the first time, the quantification of nucleosome assembly activity in vitro. In cells, CAF-1 is recruited to replication forks by the DNA polymerase processivity factor PCNA. Here, I will capitalize and expand on the assays above to integrate structural data, quantitative biochemical and biophysical measurements, and functional analyses, to elucidate how CAF-1 crosstalks to PCNA, DNA polymerases and other components of the DNA replication machinery in S phase. Specifically, the proposed research will 1) uncover how CAF-1 recruitment by PCNA affects its function in nucleosome assembly, and 2) examine how CAF-1 activity is regulated during ongoing DNA replication. This work will reveal the mechanism of nucleosome assembly during DNA replication and its interplay with S phase signaling. A mechanistic understanding of this pathway will uncover the fundamental principles that control genome and epigenome stability, thus cell fate decisions and disease avoidance.

This PhD project aims to investigate epigenetics research in the making, in order to understand how, where and why the new epigenetic knowledge is produced and identify the elements influencing the production of this emerging body of knowledge. More particularly, I will analyse the epigenetic notion of environment, by unpacking what it means in specific cases. Specifically, the project will entail: 1. A literature analysis: I will carry out both a systematic review of published epigenetics re search to examine how the notion of environment is understood and defined in the literature and a systematic review of the social science literature to understand to what extent the notion of environment is critically reflected on. 2. Fieldwork: I will explore how the notion of environment is conceptualised and enacted in two case studies using ethnographic methods: breast cancer epigenetics and the EpiTwin project looking at diabetes. 3. Analysis: I will carry out a narrative analysis of th e data collected during fieldwork in order to explore how researchers in epigenetics make sense of their world and understand the notion of environment in their professional lives.

To fully understand the contribution of the cell of origin to this heterogeneity we must first comprehensively identify the different cell types found in the breast and map how they change in response to various developmental processes. We propose here to use single cell sequencing approaches to identify and chart the differentiation dynamics of epithelial and non-epithelial breast cells during embryonic development and in response to aging, parity, lactation, menopause and germline mutations. We will use two types of single cell sequencing approaches to tackle this problem; scRNAseq and scATACseq. The scRNAseq data will allow us to identify the different types of cells found in the breast across these different developmental conditions while scATACseq will allow us to identify changes in the chromatin accessibility states of these different cell clusters thus, indicating a switch in the epigenetic identity of the cell. Therefore, if awarded, this grant will allow us to generate a comprehensive Human Breast Cell Atlas which will provide the breast cancer research community with an unparalleled resource to accelerate the discovery of novel biomarkers and mechanisms behind breast cancer development.

Cancer is a disease of heterogeneous cell populations, with acquisition of genetic/epigenetic alterations in developmental pathways contributing to the initiation and progress of the disease.Several of these developmental pathways are known, but the contribution of cellular context defined by other signaling molecules is not clear. Tumor microenvironment interaction with tumor is identified as critical contributor to the pathology of disease. However, the cellular and molecular players involved are only beginning to be understood. Oncogenic activation of Ras family of proteins, which regulate normal development, is frequently (~30-60%) detected in several types of cancer. Ras association (RalGDS/AF-6) domain family (RASSF) proteins are non-enzymatic effectors of Ras with both tumor suppressive and/or oncogenic functions. Differential expression of RASSF7 as well as few mutations in its open reading frame is observed in certain cancer tissues. Using this paradigm of RASSF7 expression in tumor, I will first probe the contribution of such effectors to tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Secondly, set up a tumor cell-niche model system to study the signaling pathways which govern these interactions. Subsequently, I will dissect key interacting pathways which can be extended to in vivo tumor growth and metastasis in a mouse model and patient samples.

Although this is common knowledge, underlying molecular processes remain unclear. Recent findings suggest telomere-associated proteins bind DNA outside telomeres genome-wide. Therefore, whether and how telomeres might influence extra-telomeric binding and function of such proteins is interesting. Our new data show that a telomeric protein regulates distantly located genes in a telomere-sensitive fashion. With this and other supporting evidence, here we investigate telomere-dependent global gene control in ways not explored before. Findings are likely to reveal molecular mechanisms linking telomeres functionally to the extra-telomeric genome.	DBT/Wellcome Trust India Alliance	Senior Fellowship Renewal	4.0346E+7	INR

A significant observation is that although this infectionmay result in a self-limiting upper respiratory infection or mild pneumonia in some patients, other patientsexperience progression of respiratory symptoms to requirement of intubation for mechanical respiratorysupport and death due to severe respiratory failure. This clinical observation strongly suggests that differencesin host immunologic response are the determinative factor in clinical outcome. We hypothesize that theproposed systems immunology, biostatistical and computational modeling approaches, coupled with detailedclinical phenotype of hospitalized COVID-19 patients will provide a new framework to interpret the interplaybetween SARS-CoV-2 virus and the host, and the relationship with clinical outcome. Project 1 will assess thefrequency and function of SARS-CoV-2 virus antigen specific T cells and evaluate their breadth and clonalityof their TCR repertoire with clinical outcome. Project 2 will determine epigenetic signatures of the immuneresponse to the SARS-CoV-2 virus across short, middle and long-term times and identify DNA methylation-based markers of anti-viral immunity and clinical outcome. With this approach, we will create a unique resourceof highly annotated longitudinal data on SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, which will enable the development ofnovel diagnostic strategies and therapeutics to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.

With the continued threat from emerging pathogens as well as complications from more common respiratory viruses, understanding these infections and their accompanying host responses remain a major priority for global public health. In particular, efforts must also be made to understand these infections within the context of an aging population. While modern germ theory has greatly reduced its burden, infectious disease remains the fourth leading cause of death in aging adults. Coupled with the robust increase in aged populations over the next two decades, these factors highlight the importance of understanding the interplay between infection and the senescent host. While significant progress has been made in understanding the age-related deficiency in adaptive immunity, much less is understood about tissue specific and innate immune cell function in the aging host. Therefore, these studies take a systems based approach to characterize and examine the early tissue-specific and innate immune responses to respiratory virus infection within the context of aging. Utilizing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the proposal seeks to compare young, middle-aged, and aged mice in order to identify, confirm, and validate major change in pathway and immune activation that contribute to enhanced susceptibility and can be exploited for therapeutic treatment. In addition, the project extends examination into primary human airway and immune cells in order to confirm and validate in vivo finding. Finally, efforts will be made to explore th contribution of broad epigenetic changes to differential responses in young and aged models. Together, these approaches will yield important findings critical to understanding and treating current and future respiratory virus infections in aged populations.

982	Prof. Dr. Jürgen KNOBLICH	Institute of Molecular Biotechnology	None	2013-09-01	2015-08-31	From stem cell to brain tumor: a genetic analysis	Stem cells have a unique property: They can generate daughter cells that remain stem cells and undergo multiple rounds of self-renewal. At the same time, they give rise to more specialized cell types that ultimately replace cells in the target tissue. While this property makes stem cells an ideal source of cells for regenerative medicine, it also means that the balance between those cell types needs to be precisely controlled. If stem cells are defective and generate only daughter cells, this leads to uncontrolled cellular amplification and it has been proposed that defects like this can contribute to the formation of certain tumors. This project uses the fruitfly Drosophila to understand the mechanisms that control this balance in stem cells of the brain. We focus on the so-called type II neuroblasts, neural stem cells that divide asymmetrically into one cell that remains a neuroblast while the other becomes an intermediate neural progenitor (INP). The INP again divides asymmetrically but now, one cell becomes a ganglion mother cell (GMC) which divides once more into two differentiating neurons Defects in lineage progression lead to the formation of a brain tumor. In wild type adult flies, all neural stem cells have differentiated into neurons. In tumor bearing flies, however, the brain is full of proliferating stem cells. In this project, we use type II neuroblasts as a model for stem cell biology and to understand, how stem cells can contribute to tumor formation. In a previous project, we have used an RNAi approach to identify 620 genes that control the multiple differentiation steps that occur in this lineage. We also have succesfully developed a method to isolate Drosophila neuroblasts and differentiating neurons and to determine all genes that are active in those cells. In this project, we build upon those previous results and characterize the most interesting hits from the RNAi screen. In particular, we use the new ability to do transcriptome analysis to characterize the many epigenetic regulators that were identified in our screen. We have evidence that the crucial steps in tumor formation are regulated by purely epigenetic means and want to analyze, how the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex prevents tumor formation in type II neuroblasts. Three members of this complex were identified in our screen, indicating an essential function for this important chromatin regulator. We will identify the key target genes and determine, how this complex regulates their activity. For this, we will establish a cell culture system to characterize the most important pathway regulating type II neuroblasts, the Notch/Delta pathway. In a complementary approach, we will determine the precise stages of tumor formation and ask, when the various tumor suppressors exert their function. Together, we hope that these experiments will allow us to understand the mechanisms of stem cell derived tumor formation at a level of detail not possible in other model organisms.

Although major advances in the treatment of MPN have been made in recent years, most MPN are incurable chronic disorders with substantial morbidity and mortality. The only curative treatment approach that can be offered at present is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Unfortunately, this procedure can only be performed in a small group of patients (young and fit). In all other patients, management is largely based on symptom-control and the use of growth-inhibitory drugs. However, most drugs used thus far in MPN, including the recently developed tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), have little if any curative potential. In addition, resistance to growth-inhibitory drugs is often seen in advanced MPN. So far, little is known about molecules, signaling networks, and mechanisms underlying disease evolution, progression, and resistance in various MPN. The situation is complicated by the fact that neoplastic stem cells (SC) exhibit intrinsic resistance, have multiple interactions with the SC-protective microenvironment, the so-called ?stem cell niche?, and acquire resistance in multiple subclones during disease evolution. Finally, the genetic background as well as epigenetic mechanisms are considered to play a role in disease evolution and progression in MPN. The general aim of this research program is to address the cellular, biochemical and functional complexity in various MPN by an integrated multidisciplinary approach, to exploit network analyses and resulting concepts to define critical target profiles in neoplastic (stem) cells, and to develop targeted treatment-strategies. The specific long-term aim of the SFB is to develop novel SC-eradicating treatment approaches in Ph+ and Ph- MPN. Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) will serve as a paradigmatic disease model in this SFB. In addition, the SFB will focus on JAK2 V617F-mutated MPN, KIT D816V-mutated systemic mastocytosis (SM) and mast cell leukemia (MCL), and FIP1L1/PDGFRA+ chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL). It can be expected that the SFB will substantially contribute to a better understanding of molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the etiology, progression, and resistance of neoplastic cells in these MPN. Furthermore, data generated in this SFB should provide a solid basis for the development of improved diagnostic and therapeutic concepts in these neoplasms.

JANTSCH	Medical University of Vienna	None	2011-02-01	2019-01-31	Coordination projekt: RNA regulation of the transcriptome	The classic view of the flow of genetic information, “gene – mRNA – protein” has experienced a change to “gene – RNA – function”. Many RNAs are now known to be terminal gene products that exert their functions in different ways: regulating other RNAs and proteins, catalysing chemical reactions, guiding RNAs to their place of action, or silencing small genomic regions or whole chromosomes. Using model organisms as diverse as bacteria, ciliates, insects, plants and mammals, this RNA-REG SFB will study how RNA regulates the flow of genetic information. All cellular processes that affect the transcriptome and are modulated by regulatory RNAs, - from epigenetic phenomena, chromatin structure and transcription to RNA processing, transport, decay and translation - will be analysed in depth with the goal of defining the RNA regulon. The unifying theme of this RNA-REG SFB is to reveal the function of regulatory RNAs, understand the mechanism(s) by which these regulations are achieved and how diverse RNA-mediated processes interconnect to result in the observed phenotypes. This will shed light on how RNAs control the flow of genomic information and how these RNAs are regulated themselves and ultimately, allow a molecular understanding of developmental dysfunctions and diseases that arise from errors in these circuits. Fifteen groups from six institutions working on the diverse aspects of RNA biology are pooling their expertises and experiences to reach this goal. Technical progress in deep sequencing, mapping RNA-protein interactions and biocomputing, together with the emerging view that RNAs regulate most biological processes, make this RNA-centric SFB timely, because they allow the application of unbiased large-scale approaches to unravel the full degree of complexity in RNA mediated processes in the cell.

Due to the rarity of NETs and difficulty in obtaining fresh tissue, very little is known about the (epi)genetic changes and gene dysregulation associated with NET development. Integration of genetics and epigenetics has emerged as a powerful approach to study cellular differentiation and tumourigenesis, this approach will be used in this study. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aims of the study are (i) the identification and validation of biomarkers relating to the underlying pathology and development of NETs, (ii) assessment of the utility of the identified biomarkers in a cohort of NET patients with metastatic disease (NET01 study) (iii) investigation of hypoxia related (epi)genetic modifications occurring in Von-Hippel Lindau (VHL) competent and deficient model systems. OUTLINE PLAN OF RESEARCH: Integrated genome-wide DNA methylation and RNA expression array analysis will be performed on a training set of 200 NET tumour samples and validated on a second set of 200 tumours. This will be performed using Illumina Beadarray technology which allows direct integration of DNA methylation and RNA expression data. Validation of identified biomarkers will then be undertaken in serum derived from a series of NET patients with metastatic disease and matched controls. Epigenetic modifications occurring in hypoxia will be investigated in cell culture based models using VHL competent and incompetent cell lines and a normal pancreatic cell line as a control. The cell lines will be cultured in normoxic and hypoxic conditions and then assessed for global methylation and promoter region specific methylation changes alongside RNA expression analysis and specific histone modifications.

Although there is now good evidence that prenatal stress can have a long lasting effect in humans there have been no studies of any interaction with underlying genetic factors, which may explain why some are more sensitive or resilient than others. The main goal of our CRP is to delineate specific risk factors prenatal stress exposure that can result in adverse neurodevelopment of the child. We have designed two|studies one of which involves recruiting a new cohort in which each of the four countries will follow an identical protocol and the second of which involves collecting DNA and new questionnaire data in our existing cohorts. feature of the first study is that we examine stress in early and late pregnancy to identify critical periods their associated outcomes.

We therefore wish to explore genotype:phenotype correlations in 6q24 diabetes, and to define more clearly the genes and mechanisms involved. We believe this will lead to improved diagnosis and treatment of this rare disorder, and give insights into the general molecular mechanisms of diabetes. Clinically, we will establish a registry of patients with 6q24 diabetes, with a view to a formal clinical characterisation of TND. Our initial results, concerning the acute presentation and current phenotype of the patients, will be directly related back to their molecular findings. Molecularly, we will investigate imprinted loci on chromosome 6 in order to determine their contribution to TND prognosis. We will map the chromosome 6q TND locus, both molecularly, in terms of both imprinted gene expression, and clinically, in terms of the chromosome anomalies seen in patients.

The natural form of collagen (I) is a heterotrimer that assembles into large extracellular fibrils. Abnormal homotrimeric collagen (I) is resistant to protease-mediated degradation and is synthesised by cancer cells to create pathways for metastatic tissue invasion. Embryonic cells have been reported to produce collagen (I) homotrimers and in adults homotrimeric collagen (I) is also associated with fibrosis and connective tissue pathologies. This project proposes to test the hypothesis that that pathologies spanning fibrosis, osteoarthritis and tumour metastasis share a common stem/progenitor cell-mediated molecular mechanism involving the aberrant production of type I collagen homotrimers. The relative expression from the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes in stem and progenitor cells will be determined by qRT-PCR and correlated with the relative amount of each collagen (I) alpha chain, assessed by metabolic labeling. Pathological tissues will be screened for homotrimer production and the contribution of self-renewing cell populations to homotrimer production determined in parallel cell cultures isolated from such tissues. Tissue explants and cell cultures will be treated with a genomic demethylating agent, to determine whether COL1A2 promotor methylation is widely used to reduce COL1A2 mRNA expression and promote the formation of alpha1 homotrimers. Finally the relative expression of each of the collagen (I) genes will be assessed in model systems from foetal to mature stages of development to determine how age-related epigenetic changes could predispose to skeletal disease. This data will be important for understanding how to harness stem cells for tissue repair and regeneration, without adverse effects on tissue function. The project is also highly relevant to the development of biomarkers of age-related frailty and stiffness and to predict the development of musculoskeletal disease.

Several diffusible molecules and transcription factors regulate SEZ neurogenesis. Whilst a few epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in SEZ cell generation the role of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is unclear. The canonical PRC2 complex consists of EED, Suz12, and Ezh2, with Jarid2 frequently contributing to it as well. PRC2 functions to methylate lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me3) via interactions with the methyl transferase enhancer-of-zest 2 (Ezh2). Whereas PRC2 and Ezh2 serve to balance self-renewal versus differentiation and neuron versus glial fate choices in early and late embryogenesis respectively, their roles in the neonatal and adult SEZ are unknown. In this project, Ezh2 function will be removed in the neonatal SEZ via cre-lox approaches to determine its role in neurogenesis. We will also knockdown Jarid2 and Eed and have shown in pilot work that this increases the number of self-renewing neurospheres, suggesting PRC2 maintains neural stem cells in quiescence. A major component of our work will involve making biotin- and FLAG-tagged knockin mice which will express tagged Jarid2 and EZH proteins underlying their own endogenous promoters. These knockin mouse models will allow us to study epigenetic regulation of neural development. Whereas the postnatal and adult SEZ mounts a response to injury in an attempt to repair, it only does so inefficiently. Since epigenetic mechanisms persist for protracted periods and seem to lock cells into a state of either pluripotency or differentiation we hypothesise they may act as "master regulators" that limit neural repair. We will test this hypothesis by modulating Jarid2, Eed and Ezh2 in the context of neonatal traumatic brain injury.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	38540.0	GBP

In recognition of this challenge, we propose to establish the “International PhD Program in Translational Oncology (IPPTO)” within the framework of the Malignant Diseases (MADI) PhD program at Medical University of Vienna (MUW). Established in 2007, MUW’s MADI PhD program encompasses all areas of cancer research. In the past 10 years the MADI program has become the largest and best established PhD program at the MUW, with the highest number of currently enrolled students and graduates. We selected top scientists from the MADI faculty, who will join forces to establish a new research focus on therapy resistance, which is one of the most challenging problems facing cancer research. The IPPTO Faculty consists of 14 internationally acclaimed MUW scientists with complementary expertise and research interests. Faculty members were selected based on their competitive track records in both research (publications, funding through peer-reviewed research grants including FWF, EU-ITN and ERC grants) and training (lecture course evaluations). The relatively high number of participating investigators reaches a critical mass, which will allow a significant improvement of the training and research potential of the current program. The scientific proposal and training concepts are based on a collaborative effort reflecting the existing network and multidisciplinary expertise of the IPPTO faculty. The PhD projects are directed toward the (i) identification of mechanisms that can be targeted to restore the efficacy of existing drugs; (ii) the identification of patient-specific treatment protocols to cure drug resistant cancer; and (iii) the design of better therapeutics that pre-empt or even exploit resistance. The projects belong to three research areas: Module 1 will address questions related to the role of intrinsic cancer cell-mediated resistance mechanisms; Module 2 will study the integration of epigenetic modifications, transcriptional control and signaling in the control of the plasticity of cancer cells; and Module 3 will seek to blunt resistance mechanisms maintained by the microenvironment, with a particular focus on immune cell populations infiltrating the tumor niche. The projects will benefit from state of art methods and models allowing for example the characterization of tumor cells and niche populations at single-cell resolution, or the investigation of patient derived tumor grafts in a humanized immune environment. The goal of the IPPTO is to consolidate the MADI program at an international level as an educational platform of excellence in cancer research. The added value of the IPPTO program is reflected by the benefits for the students (thematic coherence, team-level supervision, customized training program), the faculty (critical mass, collaborations, joint training initiative) and the MUW (new research focus, international visibility, strengthening of the oncology research cluster).

The current project is motivated by two hypothesis: 1) that the INK4/ARF locus is a sensor of epigenetic damage and this is at the basis of its activation by oncogenes and aging; and, 2) that the accumulation of cellular damage and stress is at the basis of both cancer and aging, and consequently "anti-damage genes", such as tumour suppressors, simultaneously counteract both cancer and aging. With regard to the INK4/ARF locus, the project includes: 1.1) the generation of null mice for the Regulatory Domain (RD) thought to be essential for the proper regulation of the locus; 1.2) the study of the INK4/ARF anti-sense transcription and its importance for the assembly of Polycomb repressive complexes; 1.3) the generation of mice carrying the human INK4/ARF locus to analyze, among other aspects, whether the known differences between the human and murine loci are "locus autonomous"; and, 1.4) to analyze the INK4/ARF locus in the process of epigenetic reprogramming both from ES cells to differentiated cells and, conversely, from differentiated cells to induced-pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. With regard to the impact of "anti-damage genes" on cancer and aging, the project includes: 2.1) the analysis of the aging of super-INK4/ARF mice and super-p53 mice; 2.2) we have generated super-PTEN mice and we will examine whether PTEN not only confers cancer resistance but also anti-aging activity; and, finally, 2.3) we have generated super-SIRT1 mice, which is among the best-characterized anti-aging genes in non-mammalian model systems (where it is named Sir2) involved in protection from metabolic damage, and we will study the cancer and aging of these mice. Together, this project will significantly advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer and aging.	European Research Council	Advanced Grant	2000000.0	EUR

A surprising link between epigenetics and RNAi was discovered more than a decade ago, and I was fortunate enough to be involved in this exciting field of research from the beginning. It is now well established that endogenous small RNAs have a direct impact on the genome in various organisms. Yet, the initiation of chromatin modifications in trans by exogenously introduced small RNAs has been inherently difficult to achieve in all eukaryotic cells. This has sparked controversy about the importance and conservation of RNAi-mediated epigenome regulation and hampered systematic mechanistic dissection of this phenomenon. Using fission yeast, we have discovered a counter-acting mechanism that impedes small RNA-directed formation of heterochromatin and constitutes the foundation of this proposal. Our goal is to close several knowledge gaps and test the intriguing possibility that the suppressive mechanism we discovered is conserved in mammalian cells. We will employ yeast and embryonic stem cells and use cutting-edge technologies (i.e., chemical mutagenesis combined with whole-genome sequencing, genome editing with engineered nucleases, and single-cell RNA sequencing) to address fundamental, as yet unanswered questions. My proposal consists of four major aims. In aim 1, I propose to use proteomics approaches and to perform yeast genetic screens to define additional pathway components and regulatory factors. Aim 2 builds on our ability to finally trigger de novo formation of heterochromatin by synthetic siRNAs acting in trans, addressing many of the outstanding mechanistic questions that could not be addressed in the past. In Aims 3 and 4, experiments conducted in yeast and mouse cells will elucidate missing fragments critical to our understanding of the conserved principles behind RNAi-mediated epigenetic gene regulation.

They have been shown to impact many different processes, ranging from development to organ function and carcinogenesis. Recently it has become clear that many distinct small RNA families exist. However, all act though a member of the well-conserved Argonaute family of proteins. I try to understand how specificity of the different Argonaute proteins is achieved, and I am particularly interested in Argonautes that may contribute to the epigenetic marking of genomic DNA in animals. My focus is on Argonaute function in the vertebrate germline, a tissue that is an especially intriguing system with regard to the resetting and establishment of epigenetic marks. As model system I use the zebrafish.Piwi proteins are Argonaute proteins that in vertebrates are specifically expressed in germ cells, and have been implicated in modifying chromatin structures. We demonstrated that zebrafish piwi is expressed in both the male and the female gonad and that loss of piwi results in loss of germ cells due to apoptosis. We have characterized small RNAs that bind to piwi (piRNAs) in both ovary and testis, and found that they play a role in the silencing of transposable elements. Furthermore, we have shown that the biogenesis of piRNAs differs markedly from that of other small RNAs like miRNAs.The experiments I propose address how Piwi proteins and piRNAs act in the germline to ensure a functional germline and a stable propagation of intact chromatin over generations. First, we will address the biogenesis of piRNAs. Second, we will identify novel components of the Piwi pathway. Third we will address the mode(s) of action of piRNAs. On all fronts a combination of genetics, molecular biology and biochemistry will be used.	European Research Council	Starting Grant	970000.0	EUR

Re-expression of fetal genes in the adult heart contributes to development of HF. Two mechanisms involved in the control of gene expression are epigenetics and microRNAs (miRs). We propose a project on epigenetic and miR-mediated mechanisms leading to HF. Epigenetics refers to heritable modification of DNA and histones that does not modify the genetic code. Depending on the type of modification and on the site affected, these chemical changes up- or down-regulate transcription of specific genes. Despite it being a major player in gene regulation, epigenetics has been only partly investigated in HF. miRs are regulatory RNAs that target mRNAs for inhibition. Dysregulation of the cardiac miR signature occurs in HF. miR expression may itself be under epigenetic control, constituting a miR-epigenetic regulatory network. To our knowledge, this possibility has not been studied yet.Our specific hypothesis is that the profile of DNA/histone methylation and the cross-talk between epigenetic enzymes and miRs have fundamental roles in defining the characteristics of cells during cardiac development and that the dysregulation of these processes determines the deleterious nature of the stressed heart's gene programme. We will test this first through a genome-wide study of DNA/histone methylation to generate maps of the main methylation modifications occurring in the genome of cardiac cells treated with a pro-hypertrophy regulator and of a HF model. We will then investigate the role of epigenetic enzymes deemed important in HF, through the generation and study of knockout mice models. Finally, we will test the possible therapeutic potential of modulating epigenetic genes.We hope to further understand the pathological mechanisms leading to HF and to generate data instrumental to the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for this disease.

The proposed work will investigate a novel mechanism for silencing sub-telomeric var genes and promoting their recombination in Plasmodium falciparum. The var gene family is known to undergo epigenetic silencing and switching, involving sirtuin histone deacetylases. Var genes also recombine readily to generate new variants. However, the mechanisms underlying these virulence processes are not fully understood. G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structures may influence both transcription and recombination of var genes. G4-forming sequences are strikingly rare in the AT-rich P. falciparum genome, and are concentrated around var genes. In model systems, these structures can affect both transcription and recombination by stalling RNA or DNA polymerases. A special class of 'RecQ' helicases unwind G4s and a human RecQ helicase was recently shown to operate in concert with a sirtuin: cells lacking either of these proteins developed genome instability and chromosome fusions at G-rich telomeres. In P. falciparum, I have shown that similar phenotypes are seen in a sirtuin knockout, suggesting that G4s, RecQ helicases and sirtuins may also affect DNA metabolism in the parasite. Several complementary molecular-genetic approaches will address this hypothesis. Parasites will be treated with G4-stablizing drugs and tested for altered var gene transcription, telomere maintenance and karyotypic changes. G4 sequences will be cloned upstream of reporter genes, as integrated transgenes, and their effect on transcription and recombination will be examined. Putative RecQ helicases will be knocked out and the mutant parasites phenotyped, and ChIP studies of the helicases will be carried out in strains with or without a sirtuin. Together, these experiments will provide multiple lines of evidence for the role of G4s, RecQ helicases and sirtuins in controlling transcription and recombination of P. falciparum virulence genes, thus improving our understanding of a fundamental aspect of malaria biology.

G4-forming sequences are strikingly rare in the AT-rich P. falciparum genome, and are concentrated around the major family of virulence genes, called var genes. Our recent work has showed that G4 motifs may affect the expression and recombination of var genes, thus contributing to antigenic variation and diversification. Special classes of helicases are required to unwind G4s and we have knocked out two of these helicases in P. falciparum, revealing phenotypes in var gene expression, rates of genomic recombination, and telomere maintenance. We now propose to use genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation to establish the distribution of G4 motifs and their cognate helicases throughout the P. falciparum genome. At the RNA level, we will examine the G4 content of the transcriptome via RNA base modification and structure-specific sequencing. In a second arm of experiments, we will follow up our work on the two 'RecQ' G4 helicases by making and characterising a double RecQ knockout, and also a knockout of the second class of putative G4 helicase termed FANCJ. Finally, we will characterise these knockouts not only in terms of G4-specific phenotypes, but also in their effects on DNA replication dynamics throughout the genome, using DNA fibre analysis. Together, these experiments will provide multiple lines of evidence for the presence and roles of G4s and their cognate helicases in P. falciparum, thus improving our understanding of a novel aspect of malaria biology that is highly relevant to virulence.

The human SVZ can be cultured as neurospheres, proving that latent stem cells, which could be stimulated via epigenetic mechanisms, reside in the tissue. These findings make targeting human SVZ stem cells for neural repair more relevant than ever, since it proves that they are stem cells and migrate naturally to clinically relevant areas. This project is designed to uncover epigenetic mechanisms that can be used to control and enhance stem cell-mediated neurogenesis and repair. We have shown that loss of Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (Ezh2) function, the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) histone methyltransferase, significantly reduces neurogenesis in the adult subventricular zone (SVZ)/olfactory bulb (OB) system. We now plan to extend these data by studying how PRC2 is functionally related to lnRNAs. Genomic analysis indicated that an unanticipated large percentage of genomic DNA encodes for lnRNAs. It has been estimated that about 20% of human lncRNAs bind to PRC2 and help direct them to specific nuclear sites. lncRNA expression in turn can be modulated by PRC2 and PRC1 suggesting recursive functional interactions between these molecules. Because of the large concentration of lncRNAs in the SVZ, we hypothesize that in this system they also functionally interact with PRC2 function. It is becoming increasingly evident that lncRNAs have clinical relevance via lncRNA interactions with PRC2. We will focus on PRC2 and two lncRNAs, RIAN and YSD14/Haunt. The Shen lab has generated both these knockouts. We will use complementary in vivo and in vitro approaches to study their function in ES cells as well as in normal postnatal and adult neurogenesis.

Such cells can be obtained by in vitro direct reprogramming of somatic cells into embryonic stem (ES)-like cells, termed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). This approach also opens possibilities for modelling human diseases in vitro. However, major hurdles remain that restrain fulfilling conventional human iPSC/ESC potential, as they reside in an advanced primed pluripotent state. Such hurdles include limited differentiation capacity and functional variability. Further, in vitro iPSC based research platforms are simplistic and iPSC based “humanized” chimeric mouse models may be of great benefit. The recent isolation of distinct and new “mouse-like” naive pluripotent states in humans that correspond to earlier embryonic developmental state(s), constitutes a paradigm shift and may alleviate limitations of conventional primed iPSCs/ESCs. Thus, our proposal aims at dissecting the human naïve pluripotent state(s) and to unveil pathways that facilitate their unique identity and flexible programming. Specific goals: 1) Transcriptional and Epigenetic Design Principles of Human Naïve Pluripotency 2) Signalling Principles Governing Human Naïve Pluripotency Maintenance and Differentiation 3) Defining Functional Competence and Safety of Human Naïve Pluripotent Stem Cells in vitro 4) Novel human naïve iPSC based cross-species chimeric mice for studying human differentiation and disease modelling in vivo. These aims will be conducted by utilizing engineered human iPSC/ESC models, CRISPR/Cas9 genome-wide screening, advanced microscopy and ex-vivo whole embryo culture methods. Our goals will synergistically lead to the design of strategies that will accelerate the safe medical application of human naive pluripotent stem cells and their use in disease specific modelling and applied stem cell research.

Recently completed whole genome sequences have revealed a wealth of information about the evolutionary origins and metabolic adaptations that may have led to their ecological success. A major finding is that they have acquired genes both from their endosymbiotic ancestors and by horizontal gene transfer from marine bacteria. This unique melting pot of genes encodes novel and largely unexplored capacities for metabolic management. The project will address the current gap in knowledge about the physiological functions of diatom gene products and about the evolutionary mechanisms that have led to diatom success in contemporary oceans. We will exploit genome-enabled approaches to pioneer new research topics addressing:1. How has diatom evolution enabled interactions between chloroplasts and mitochondria that have provided diatoms with physiological and metabolic innovations?2. What are the relative contributions of DNA sequence variation and epigenetic processes in diatom adaptive dynamics?By combining these questions, we will uniquely be able to identify sentinel genes that have driven major physiological and metabolic innovations in diatoms, and will explore the mechanisms that have selected and molded them during diatom evolution. We will focus our studies largely on diatom responses to nutrients, in particular nitrate and iron, and will exploit the advantages of Phaeodactylum tricornutum as a model diatom species for reverse genetics. The proposed studies will revisit textbook understanding of photosynthesis and nitrogen metabolism, and will refine hypotheses about why diatoms dominate in contemporary ocean settings. By placing our studies in evolutionary and ecological contexts, in particular by examining the contribution of epigenetic processes in diatoms, our work will furthermore provide insights into how the environment selects for fitness in phytoplankton.

However, our emerging knowledge of gene regulation networks reveals that epigenetic regulation of the hereditary information plays crucial roles in various biological events through its influence on processes such as transcription, DNA replication and chromosome architecture. Another scenario in which the control of chromatin structure is crucial is the repair of lesions in genomic DNA. There is mounting evidence, particularly from model organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, that histone modifying enzymes (acetylases, deacetylases, kinases, &) are essential components of the machinery that maintains genome integrity and thereby guards against cancer, degenerative diseases and ageing. However, little is known about the specific code of histone tail modifications that coordinate DNA repair, and the impact that an aberrant histone code may have on human health. In CHROMOREPAIR we will systematically analyze the chromatin remodelling process that undergoes at DNA lesions and evaluate the impact that chromatin alterations have on the access, signaling and repair of DNA damage. Furthermore, we propose to translate our in vitro knowledge to the development of mouse models that help us evaluate how modulation of chromatin status impinges on genome maintenance and therefore on cancer and aging. As a provocative line of research and based on our preliminary data, we propose that certain chromatin alterations could not only impair but also in some cases promote a more robust response to DNA breaks, which could be a novel and not yet explored way to potentiate the elimination of pre-cancerous cells.

Specifically, we plan to focus on the role of long non-coding RNAs and histone modifications in splicing regulation during cell differentiation. Towards that end, we plan to monitor RNA and chromatin changes across many time points through RNASeq and ChIPSeq in two cell differentiation models: 1) the induced transdifferentiation of human pre-B cells into macrophages, and 2) organ morphogenesis during fly development. By investigating, through these time course experiments, patterns of molecular co-variation?for instance, between inclusion levels of alternative exons and histone modifications?we can learn how these factors participate, and eventually cooperate, to modulate the condition specific abundance of the alternative splice forms. We plan therefore to develop statistical methods to infer significant patterns of molecular co-variation through the analysis of datasets profiling RNA and chromatin structure across many data points. Based on these findings, we plan to develop a mathematical model of splicing in which the relative abundance of alternative splice forms is predicted from the relevant genetic and epigenetic factors. To facilitate the storage, organization, access, and analysis of the data produced through the project we propose to develop a robust, efficient, and scalable software system. The system will be open source, so that it can be used and enhanced by other researchers. Realizing that the current model for the storage of publicly available biomolecular data, based on centralized repositories, may not be longer sustainable, we will design our software system assuming a peer-to-peer like network of distributed RNASeq data and resources, across which bioinformatics analyses will be transparently performed.

Microbes evolve rapidly in changing environments, and global change may soon cause future microbial populations to differ genetically and phenotypically from contemporary populations. We have both pragmatic and intellectual interests in microbial evolution, especially when microbial communities perform important ecological services. For example, marine phytoplankton are responsible for half of global primary production, and make up the biological carbon sink in oceans. However, marine environments are changing in complex ways, and future global carbon and energy cycles may depend heavily on how phytoplankton evolve in response to global change. My research will study how photosynthetic microbes evolve in complex environments. First, I will use mathematical models and experimental evolution in a microalgal model system to compare phenotypic changes between populations that have evolved either in an environment where many variables change simultaneously, or in an environment where only one variable changes at a time. Second, I will use the same model system to study if and how heritable epigenetic change, such as methylation and miRNA regulation, affects long-term adaptation. Both sets of experiments will use environmental shifts that are associated with global change, thus providing information specific to marine phytoplankton evolution, as well as insight into fundamental evolutionary processes. Finally, I will use RAD sequening in natural algal isolates from high CO2 environments to map and produce a list of candidate loci that may have contributed to long-term evolution in elevated CO2. The results of this work will significantly improve our ability to use evolutionary theory to understand how microbes are likely to change over the coming decades.

Processes ensuring germ cell development, genomic stability and reproductive lifespan are essential for the long-term success of a species. Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) support spermatogenesis throughout life, the identity of this mammalian adult stem cell population in vivo remains unknown. Here, we propose analyze the contribution of both short and long non-coding RNAs to mammalian male germ cell development and SSC homeostasis. In the mouse male germline the small non-coding piRNAs and their interacting-Piwi proteins Mili and Miwi2 are essential for the establishment of epigenetic transposon silencing. Miwi2 is also required for the long-term survival of SSCs in adult mice and in contrast to Mili, Miwi2 is not broadly expressed during adult spermatogeneis. We found that Miwi2 is expressed in in vitro cultured SSCs and in a tiny population of adult testis cells in vivo. We will determine if Miwi2 expression identifies the illusive SSC population with long-term self-renewal capacity in vivo and explore the biology of this adult stem cell population as well as the molecular mechanisms by which the Miwi2-piRNA pathway governs SSC maintenance. We will also define function(s) beyond transposon silencing for Mili during spermatogenesis. Recently, transcriptome sequencing has reveled abundant and diverse classes of genes encoding long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) whose functions remains mostly unknown. We will explore the contribution this novel class of cellular RNAs in SSC self-renewal and differentiation. For the above, we propose using state-of-the-art mouse genetic strategies, high throughput sequencing, shRNA screening and proteomic approaches. In summary, this proposal aims to address basic questions at the intersection of non-coding RNA function and germ cell development/maintenance to reveal processes that underpin the integrity of the immortal lineage.

The development of high-throughput, low-cost technologies for studying the human and pathogen genomes, along with the epigenome, transcriptome and proteome have resulted in an exponential growth in available data. The current standard analytical approaches rely on single-level analyses of these datasets. However, complex systems, such as the host-pathogen interaction within an individual patient, can only be understood thoroughly if considered as a whole. I aim to integrate and then explore the complex genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic and clinical data of unique cohorts of infectious disease patients using advanced bioinformatics techniques. I will identify the host response that is common across different diseases, as well as the response that is unique to each disease, while unravelling relationships between the different data layers. The integrative analysis will lead to a better understanding of the key biological processes involved in the host response to infection, to the discovery of robust biomarkers, as well as disease subtypes. The results will be crucial for the identification of patient-specific interventions, and thus providing a stepping stone for bringing precision medicine closer to clinical practice.

There is currently a disproportionate increase in age-related health issues, with one of the major problems being the age related loss of muscle mass and function - sarcopaenia. Redox and epigenetic factors are key regulatory pathways associated with ageing. MicroRNAs, stable RNAs with half-life >24h, regulate muscle homeostasis posttranscriptionally. Oxidative modification of microRNAs results in the regulation of non-native targets. Redox balance is disrupted during ageing and the accumulation of oxidised, most likely pathogenic, microRNAs (oxi-miRs) in muscle leads to their disrupted specificity for regulating protein content. We have validated microRNAs/mRNAs/proteins networks affected by ageing in muscle and have shown that modifying microRNA expression improves muscle function, but there is currently no research into the function of oxi-miRs in ageing. Integrating epigenetic/redox experimental approaches with functional studies, we will validate key oximiRs and targets in muscle and establish the potential of inhibiting pathogenic oxi-miRs as novel, exciting strategy against sarcopaenia.

The established view is that genetic and epigenetic factors interact to create specific transcriptional responses that help plants to cope with harmful environments. Of particular interest is the response of plants to repeated episodes of the same stress, and there is no doubt that epigenetic memory within the same generation plays an important role in acclimating or priming plants for subsequent exposure to the same stress. We are, however, only beginning to understand how such epigenetic memory is first created and then maintained. In addition, our knowledge of how and how quickly induced epigenetic changes are reset remains inadequate. In AUREATE, we will use the model plant Arabidopsis to gain insights into whether and how vegetative and stem cells differ in their acquisition and maintenance of epigenetic memory, using state-of-the-art methods for cell-type specific analyses. Since transposable elements are a major force shaping the distribution of epigenetic marks along the genome, and at the same time represent the most variable components of genomes, we will examine a range of genetically diverse strains in order to pinpoint the role of transposable elements in differential epigenetic memory. Next, as a first step towards understanding how epigenetic memory can be passed on to the next generation, we will reveal the mode of transmission of newly acquired epigenetic information from germline stem cells in the shoot apical meristem to gametes. In the course of these studies, we will have identified specific regions of the genome that are sensitive to epigenetic modification upon stress, reveal which ones are stable or reset during germline development, and which ones are stable or vary during evolution. Using genetics and targeted epigenome modification, we will then begin to reveal the underlying mechanisms responsible for epigenetic memory. In summary, the outputs of AUREATE will provide a deeper understanding of transgenerational memory in plants and its potential application to enhance stress resilience in economically important plant species.

Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms that drive inflammation remain poorly understood. Enzymes play a crucial regulatory role in inflammation and represent potential drug targets. Nevertheless, the activities of these enzymes are poorly studied due to a lack of convenient tools for modulation and detection. The importance of this issue is demonstrated by my previous work on small molecule probes for protein palmitoylation. It becomes increasingly clear that the slow advance in the development of chemistry-based methods to study enzyme activity in its physiological context delays drug discovery.To address this problem further, I will develop novel detection methods and small molecule inhibitors to study inflammatory signal transduction pathways. Protein acetylations at lysine residues have a broad regulatory scope. Acetylations of histones form a major part of the histone code for epigenetic regulation of gene-transcription. In addition, reversible acetylations of non-histone proteins proved to be crucial for regulation of nuclear factor kB (NF kB) mediated gene transcription. I aim to study the role of acetylations of histones and other proteins in NF kB mediated gene transcription. Firstly, I will develop a novel bioorthogonal ligation strategy for chemical labeling of protein acetylation in cells (aim 1) by employing the oxidative Heck reaction. Secondly, I will be the first to systematically investigate changes in protein acetylation in response to activation of the NF kB pathway using a proteomics strategy (aim 2). Thirdly, I will develop small molecule inhibitors of acetyltransferases and study their impact on acetylations that regulate the NF kB signaling pathway (aim 3).Ultimately, these newly developed detection methods and small molecule inhibitors open up opportunities for drug discovery aimed at epigenetic regulation of NF kB mediated inflammation.

However, recent high throughput approach studies indicate that the impact of TE-associated activities was seriously underestimated. The first objective is to investigate the impact of TE-derived activities on the human genome in general and on disease mechanisms in particular, based on the central premise that some of these activities are stress-induced. To model how a vertebrate-specific transposon responds to stress signals in human cells, I will study molecular interactions of the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon with host cellular mechanisms to understand how stress-signalling and response triggers transposon activation. My second aim is to decipher the relationship between stress-induced activation of endogenous TEs and TE-derived regulatory sequences and human disease. I aim at investigating conditions and the consequences of activation of a particular copy of the MERmaid transposon located in the Sin3B transcriptional corepressor, frequently observed in cancer. The impact of global epigenetic remodelling will be investigated in the model of a complete (induced pluripotency) and partial (trans-differentiation) epigenetic reprogramming. In parallel, I aim at translating experience accumulated in TE research to cutting-edge technologies. First, the SB transposon will be adopted as a safe, therapeutic vector to treat age-dependent blindness (AMD). Second, a mutagenic SB vector will be used in a forward genetic screen to decipher a genetic network that protects against hormone-induced mammary cancer. The anticipated output of my research programme is a refined understanding of the consequences of environmental stress on our genome mediated by TE-derived sequences. The project is expected to provide an effective bridge between basic research and clinical- as well as technological translation of a novel gene transfer technology.

We will capitalize on 25 years of studies on the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes used as a model, to focus on three objectives which will significantly increase our knowledge of the bacterium, of the cell biology of infection and of the epigenetic reprogramming upon infection. Our aims are: - at the bacterial level : to describe for the first time, the proteomic landscape of a bacterium during switch from saprophytism to virulence. We will use a proteogenomic approach together with ribosome profiling, to analyze the translation of the whole transcriptome after bacterial growth in several conditions, including in vivo, in order to barcode all the proteins which play a role in infection. This will open the way to assess the role of 1) small proteins; 2) internal translation initiation sites ; 3) the coupling of transcription and translation. - at the host cell level : To decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying the dynamics and role in infection of host intracellular organelles, starting with mitochondria. - At the host epigenetic level : To explore how the microbe reprograms host transcription and how tolerance to a commensal such as Akkermansia muciniphila differs from responsiveness to a pathogen insult, at the level of histones and mRNA modifications by studying 1) chromatin remodeling, in particular histones modifications during infection ; 2) modifications of the epitranscriptome during Listeria infection and colonization with Akkermansia ; 3) whether there is an epigenetic memory of infection and colonization. This ambitious multidisciplinary project will not only generate new concepts in infection biology but also will unravel fundamental mechanisms in microbiology, cell biology, and epigenetics opening new avenues for further research.

As part of a Breast Cancer Campaign funded pilot project we have identified 3 miRNAs (miR-127-3p, miR-409-3p and miR-495) that are associated with resistance to lapatinib in HER2-positive breast cancer cells. We have been able to demonstrate that modulating the intracellular levels of these miRNAs can restore sensitivity to lapatinib. Pharmacological methylation reversal studies suggest that these miRNAs might be epigenetically regulated. In silico analysis combined with gene expression array data identified several putative targets of these miRNAs, some of which have already passed early validation steps (P-Rex1 and VAV2). Aims: This project aims to expand our current validation work to establish targets of miR-127-3p, miR-409-3p and miR-495 in HER2-positive breast cancer cells and to elucidate their functional role in resistance to HER2-directed therapy. Techniques and Methodology: The proposed project consists of 4 experimental plans: 1) Employing established techniques (qPCR, Western blot, Luciferase reporter assay) to validate identified putative targets; 2) Functional characterisation of selected, validated targets, by standard overexpression and knockdown analysis and lapatinib cytotoxicity assays; 3) Confirming altered epigenetic regulation of the miRNAs using methylation-specific PCR and pyrosequencing; 4).Validation of these findings (miRNAs and targets) in clinical patient samples from patients undergoing preoperative treatment with lapatinib. Impact on breast cancer research: Understanding the role of miRNAs in resistance to lapatinib might help to identify new avenues to tailor HER2-directed therapies and allow the development of new therapeutic strategies that improve patient survival. Additionally, the proposed studies on human patient samples will provide insights into the usefulness of these miRNAs and their targets, individually or in combination as predictive and prognostic markers.

Correspondingly, this process is limited by a variety of host-encoded activities, amongst which epigenetics plays a role of increasingly recognized importance. Our recent work has revealed that KRAB/KAP1-mediated transcriptional repression is crucial to the silencing of endogenous retroviruses during early embryogenesis. Under the auspices of the present “Bonus of Excellence” award, we will follow up on this discovery and more broadly study the impact of epigenetic regulation on the control of viral and virus-related genetic invaders. The objectives of this three-year funding period will be to:1.Dissect further the mechanism of KRAB/KAP1-mediated control of endogenous retroviruses.2.Probe a potential implication of this regulation system in the establishment and maintenance of HIV latency.3.Explore the modalities of epigenetic control of non-LTR retrotransposons.4.Investigate a putative role for KRAB/KAP1 in CMV latency and reactivation.

KRAB-ZFPs are tetrapod-restricted sequence-specific DNA binding transcriptional repressors that act by triggering the formation of heterochromatin through their apparently universal cofactor KAP1. KRAB-ZFP genes were subjected to intense positive selection during recent evolution, suggesting that their products are involved in speciation or innate immunity. However, the target of KRAB/KAP regulation largely remained a terra incognita when we started exploring this question about a decade ago. We invested several years of stealth work to build the foundations of this project through the engineering of experimental systems such as conditional knockout mice and derived cell lines, the generation and testing of key reagents (e.g. libraries of expression and knockdown vectors, antibodies, probes) and the establishment of essential protocols (e.g. in vivo gene manipulations of various kinds, chromatin immunoprecipitation/deep sequencing). This effort was ultimately rewarded by discoveries on the mechanisms of KRAB/KAP-mediated repression and on the functions of this regulatory system, whether during early embryogenesis or in adult tissues. For instance, we demonstrated that the KRAB/KAP system is responsible for silencing endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) in early embryos, and that it contributes to the maintenance of imprinting marks. We also revealed that the KRAB/KAP-mediated control of ERVs is crucial not just to prevent retrotransposition, but more broadly to safeguard the transcriptional dynamics of embryonic stem cells by repressing retroelement-based enhancers, and that it triggers the early embryonic establishment of site-specific DNA methylation patterns that are maintained during development. In parallel, we determined that KRAB/KAP-mediated gene regulation, which probably arose as a defense against retroelements, was co-opted during evolution to serve as a master regulator of mammalian homeostasis, now key to events as diverse as the management of behavioral stress, the maturation and activation of B and T lymphocytes, the hepatic metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics, as well as many steps of hematopoiesis. The present project is designed to pursue our investigation of the targets, mediators, mechanisms and functional significance of KRAB/KAP-mediated control of transposable elements (TEs). It will be articulated around the following specific aims:1.Obtain a high-definition characterization of TE sequences targeted by this process.2.Explore the DNA methylation-dependence of KRAB/KAP-mediated recognition of TEs.3.Identify KRAB-ZFPs responsible for repressing specific TEs. 4.Perform a structure-function analysis of KRAB-ZFP/TE recognition.5.Analyze KRAB/KAP-mediated control of TE-related sequences in placenta.6.Ask whether the KRAB/KAP system partakes in the control of TEs in germ cells. 7.Pursue our study of the epigenetic impact of KRAB/KAP-mediated TE repression.

1015	Dr Katie Lunnon	University of Exeter	Institute of Biomed & Clinical Science	2016-07-01	2020-06-30	JPND: Targeting epigenetic dysregulation in the brainstem in Alzheimer's Disease (EPI-AD)	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects brain integrity and functioning, resulting in progressive cognitive deterioration. Previous work indicates that epigenetic mechanisms including DNA (hydroxy)methylation represent critical factors in the pathogenesis of AD. Moreover, the early occurrence of various neuropsychological symptoms and novel neuropathological findings suggest a key role for the brainstem, particularly serotonin (5-HT)- and noradrenaline (NA)-specific neurons. Therefore, we hypothesise that epigenetic dysregulation in the brainstem has a critical role in the early pathogenesis of AD and aim to elucidate the exact role of DNA (hydroxy)methylation within the brainstem in the development and progression of AD. Our objectives will be addressed within our cross-disciplinary network, through the use of established large human cohorts. The consortium will link the epigenetic profiles with cognitive dysfunction, AD-related neuropathology, gene variants regulating 5-HT and NA-function (Objectives I & II). For biomarker discovery, blood epigenetic signatures of aging individuals will be linked to subsequent cognitive decline, MCI-AD conversion and depression (Objective III). The putative signatures will also be compared to established (more invasive) biomarkers to determine their validity. By making use of iPSCs (Objective IV), the project will furthermore test whether i) neurons derived from iPSCs of AD patients develop an AD-characteristic molecular/epigenetic and cellular phenotype when exposed to AD brain extracts or glucocorticoids (GCs), and ii) epigenetic editing of candidate genes (from Objectives I and II) within 5-HT and NA neurons generated from iPSCs can reverse AD-specific phenotypes. The comprehensive approach of this project will fill the vital gap in our understanding of the links between epigenetic dysregulation and the 5-HT and NA neurotransmitter systems in the pathophysiology of AD.

1016	Dr Shravanti Rampalli-Deshpande	Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Bangalore	None	2011-10-15	2017-10-14	Understanding the epigenetic basis of fibroblast plasticity.	Fibroblast cells play a central role in mammalian physiology, development, and aging. These relatively abundant cell types contribute significantly to more than one lineage during regeneration of lost body parts in lower vertebrates. Although murine and human fibroblasts do not exhibit a similar degree of plasticity, fibroblastic tumors demonstrate a range of cellular differentiation that may be attributed to phenotypic plasticity of the normal fibroblasts. However, the concept of mammalian fi broblast cell plasticity has recently gained considerable momentum, as recent studies have demonstrated conversion into a variety of lineages. While fibroblasts can be induced to differentiate towards specified lineages, the molecular basis of observed plasticity is largely unexplored. The proposed studies will evaluate the role of epigenetic regulators in reprogramming of fibroblasts towards pluripotency and directed lineage differentiation. These studies will not only provide important mechan istic insights into the role of epigenetic factors in erasing differentiated cell memory and establishment/maintenance of pluri/multipotent cell fate, but will allow us to screen for molecules for generation of desired tissue types for therapeutic purposes. Since lineage conversion is an integral part of regeneration, our studies will provide the road map to understand loss of regeneration competency during mammalian development.

In this application, we propose to identify the functional differences between normal and oncogenic NSD1/NSD3 fusion proteins in order to decipher their role in oncogenesis. It is currently unclear how the oncogenic NSD fusion proteins work at &nbsp;molecular level to alter gene expression and most importantly, to which extent their role as transcription factors and epigenetic regulators differ from that of the "normal"; NSD proteins. Molecular approaches that rely on targeting specific molecules represent the future of leukemia therapy because they have the potential of an increased efficiency while limiting potentially detrimental effects on other normal cellular pathways. Implementing such targeted approaches against leukemia requires a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanism at the origin of the leukemic transformation of a cell. Epigenetic regulators like NSD1/NSD3 are key regulators for the development of healthy blood cells and by studying their mechanism of action in normal cells will enable us to understand why a cell becomes leukemic when regulatory molecules of this type are disrupted by mutation. We might then be able to correct the molecular default at the origin of leukemia.	DBT/Wellcome Trust India Alliance	Intermediate Fellowship	3.605558E+7	INR

1019	Dr Arthur Zelent	Institute of Cancer Research	None	2011-03-01	2013-04-30	Role of Histone Deacetylase 9 in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia	Background: In my laboratory we have recently generated an in vivo mouse model to demonstrate the oncogenic potential of the epigenetic enzyme, histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9), which we previously discovered and cloned. This work clearly demonstrates that HDAC9 plays an important role in mature lymphoproliferative diseases with HDAC9 transgenic (Tg) mice developing germinal centre (GC) and post-GC B-cell lymphomas (some presenting plasmacytic differentiation). Immunophenotypic (FACS) analysis has demonstrated that a fraction (4/19, 21%) of these tumours in HDAC9 Tg mice express the cell surface antigens CD5 and B220/CD45R (CD5+/B220+). These B-cell tumours display histogenetic features reminiscent of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) therefore a common oncogenic trigger maybe involved. Moreover, preliminary analysis of patient samples and/or publicly available microarray data has shown high levels of HDAC9 expression in CLL, as well as B-Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma (B-NHL). CLL is characterized by the clonal expansion of CD5+/CD27+ B cells that are thought to derive from antigen-experienced marginal zone B cells and it is noteworthy that HDAC9 is not highly expressed in normal cells expressing the CD27 memory B cell marker. Aims and Objectives: The aim of this study is to study the causes of aberrant HDAC9 expression in CLL and the mechanisms by which its inappropriate expression contributes to CLL pathogenesis. Methods: Work will focus on studying the mechanisms by which inappropriate expression of HDAC9 contributes to the pathogenesis of CLL through further in vitro/in vivo studies, which will utilize in a comparative way the HDAC9 Tg mouse model, an established CLL cell line and primary CLL patient samples. We will analyze a larger cohort of HDAC9 Tg mice for cell morphology consistent with a CLL phenotype We will also study expression of HDAC9 in CLL patient samples to see if it is a prognostic marker for disease progression and patient outcome. Investigation of the mechanisms underlying aberrant expression of HDAC9 in human CLL will focus on targeting of HDAC9 by the CLL-associated microRNAs miR-15a and miR-30d. We will also investigate whether epigenetic mechanisms can deregulate HDAC9 expression in CLL. We will also investigate whether HDAC9 functions in CLL pathogenesis, at least in part, through contributing to a loss of functional p53 and an increase in functional BCL6, both of which are negative prognostic indicators in CLL. How the results of this research will be used: It is anticipated that the results of this work will lead to better understanding of CLL pathogenesis and in turn highlight new ways of treating this indolent but nevertheless incurable disease.

A recently described group of these transcripts called long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) has been shown to regulate expression of coding genes via epigenetic mechanisms. The majority of lncRNAs act by recruiting chromatin regulators on their target genes. lncRNAs are likely to have a role in cancer development and they have been implicated in the silencing of the tumor suppressor p15 in leukaemia and in the regulation of p53 pathway. lncRNAs are also known to regulate some imprinted gene clusters, by playing a role in the constitutive silencing on one parental allele. Disruption of lncRNA-mediated gene silencing at imprinted genes may be an underlying mechanism for the loss of imprinting observed in many cancers. To test this hypothesis we are studying a human genomic locus containing a maternally imprinted tumor suppressor gene whose function is abrogated in ovarian and breast cancers. This locus also contains a non-coding transcript, which we functionally characterized as a novel lncRNA. Preliminary data show that depletion of this lncRNA both in human breast cancer and mammary epithelial cells is associated with up-regulation of the neighboring imprinted gene and delay of cellular proliferation, suggesting that this lncRNA may play a role in cancer through the regulation of the neighboring tumor suppressor. With this project we aim to identify the chromatin-modifying proteins that bind to lncRNA and the genes to which these proteins are recruited via the lncRNA. These data will further our knowledge of how lncRNAs regulate gene expression during cancer development and provide insight into possible therapeutic targets for cancer therapy.

1021	Dr Vermeulen	UNIVERSITAIR MEDISCH CENTRUM UTRECHT	None	2013-02-01	2018-02-01	Regulation of gene expression and cell fate by DNA (hydroxy)methylation	(Hydroxy)methylation of cytosine residues in eukaryotic DNA represents a major means to regulate gene expression during development. These modifications are considered to be epigenetic marks, since they have a profound impact on phenotype, but are inherited from mother to daughter cells independent of the underlying DNA sequence. Large efforts are currently underway to profile genome-wide DNA (hydroxy)methylation patterns in model organisms and in clinical studies, since aberrant DNA (hydroxy)methylation is a hallmark of cancer. Strikingly, the molecular mechanisms underlying the link between DNA (hydroxy)methylation and gene expression remain elusive. Although causal links are thought to arise from differential recruitment of transcription factors to (hydroxy)methylated DNA in a regulated manner during development, technical limitations have thus far prevented unbiased interaction screenings to investigate this hypothesis in detail. By using a unique combination of state-of-the-art quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics technology, genomics approaches and biochemical experiments, I will systematically investigate which proteins interact with or are repelled by (hydroxy)methylated DNA during stem cell differentiation into a neuronal lineage. Furthermore, I will investigate whether and to what extent these interactions regulate gene expression programs and lineage commitment. The results of these studies will reveal the mechanisms through which dynamic DNA (hydroxy)methylation patterns dictate cellular responses. This is anticipated to significantly increase our understanding of eukaryotic development and the role of epigenetics herein. Furthermore, these studies will pave the way for designing strategies aimed at interfering with altered epigenetics patterns in disease.	European Research Council	Starting Grant	1499776.0	EUR

Such patients with EGFR mutations have good outcomes with gefitinib/erlotinib but many ultimately relapse. BIBW2992 is a second generation irreversible EGFR inhibitor, active against the T790M genotype associated with gefitinib/erlotinib resistance. Aims: To examine the efficacy and safety of BIBW 2992 in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and suspected EGFR mutation considered unfit for chemotherapy. Outcome measures Primary: progression-free survival (at 6 months) Secondary: response rate, overall survival, safety, performance status (PS) change at 1 month and treatment compliance. Design: Open label single arm phase II trial. Eligibility: 37 adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR genotype unknown (failed/inadequate tissue) and never- or ex-light smoker (i.e. likely to have EGFR mutation) unfit for radical treatment or chemotherapy (PS 0-3). Schedule: Treatment with daily oral BIBW2992 (40mg) until disease progression, toxicity, or physician/patient decision. Radiological assessments every 8 weeks using RECIST criteria. Translational research: systems biology of BIBW2992 resistance Baseline: collection of EDTA blood (germ-line pharmacogenomics), serum (epigenetic studies), plasma and urine for exploratory proteomic and metabonomic studies. Surplus somatic DNA and archival paraffin embedded formalin fixed diagnostic tissue will be collected if available. On treatment: Collection of blood, serum, plasma, and urine at intervals of 3 cycles until progression. On progression: Final collection of blood, serum, plasma, and urine.

In common with other malignancies, loss of gene function resulting from DNA hypermethylation has been shown in NB. To date however, other mechanisms such as histone methylation, and their gene targets have not been characterised. As several novel small molecule drugs capable of specifically targeting components of the repressive epigenetic machinery are now emerging, it is vital to define the full spectrum of repressive marks in NB cells together with the genes they affect. Drug induced removal of such epigenetic blocks may represent a new therapeutic option for cancer. AIMS & OBJECTIVES: This study will evaluate epigenetic inhibitors for their therapeutic potential on NB cells. In particular, we will compare drug treatments with highest efficacy against cells representative of poor prognosis NB, in parallel with transcriptomic and epigenetic profiling. We will therefore determine which genes/pathways and epigenetic marks are integral to development and maintenance of neuroblastoma. METHODS: This study assess cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis together with array-based gene expression and epigenetic analyses. HOW THE RESULTS OF THIS RESEARCH WILL BE USED: By determining which genes and epigenetic marks are important to NB aetiology, and which epigenetic inhibitors, or combinations thereof, are optimal for reactivating silenced genes, we will evaluate potential novel therapies for NB.

1024	Dr Marian Burr	University of Cambridge	None	2016-05-01	2020-04-30	Understanding molecular mechanisms of leukaemia stem cell self-renewal to identify novel targets for therapy	Background Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is sustained and propagated by a small population of self-renewing leukaemic stem cells (LSC). Whilst the regulation of stem cell self-renewal is incompletely understood, transcriptional and epigenetic networks play a critical role. Abnormal epigenetic regulation is a key mechanism underpinning the pathogenesis of AML and the reversibility of epigenetic modifications creates opportunity for therapeutic intervention. LSC are frequently resistant to conventional chemotherapy and there is a need for novel therapies effective against these cells. However, the ability to study LSC has been limited as they are a rare population in AML and once transferred to culture in vitro they rapidly differentiate into more mature leukaemic blasts. The Dawson laboratory has recently developed a technique to maintain LSC in culture indefinitely presenting a unique opportunity to study this elusive population. Aims i)Use functional proteomics to identify cell surface and intracellular proteins differentially expressed in LSC compared to normal haematopoietic stems cells (HSC) and characterise cellular pathways activated in LSC and altered during differentiation ii)Identify proteins, and in particular epigenetic regulators, essential for LSC survival and self-renewal Methods I will perform a differential analysis of the plasma membrane and whole cell proteome of enriched populations of LSC, leukaemic blasts and HSC-like cells. This novel approach will identify proteins upregulated in LSC. Early changes in the LSC proteome during differentiation into leukaemic blasts will be quantified using multiplexed isobaric tandem mass tags. To identify proteins essential for LSC survival and self-renewal I will perform parallel in vitro negative selection screens in LSC, leukaemic blasts and HSC-like cells using a bespoke shRNA library targeting epigenetic regulators and a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA library. Integrated analysis of the genetic and proteomic data will identify candidate proteins critical for LSC maintenance. The molecular and functional role of these proteins in LSC self-renewal will be characterised in vitro and in vivo in a murine model of leukaemia. Significance A combined functional proteomic and genetics approach provides a powerful means to identify the specific cellular pathways activated in LSC that drive malignant self-renewal. My primary focus is to identify epigenetic regulators required for the maintenance of LSC, but not HSC, to reveal novel therapeutic targets in AML. Proteomic characterisation of LSC to identify specific cell surface markers will facilitate isolation of these cells and inform the development of future antibody-based therapies.

1026	Dr Valentina Boeva	INSERM U1016	None	2016-11-01	2017-10-31	Design of computational methodology to assess epigenetic states in primary tumors contaminated by normal cells	The aim of this proposal is to develop a computational technique to characterize histone modifications and open chromatin sites in primary tumor tissues, i.e., tissues that represent a mixture of cancer and normal cells. Such a method, if created, will be highly used by the research community to study chromatin remodeling in cancer initiation and progression and search for prognostic and predictive epigenetic markers correlating with drug sensitivity and/or overall patient survival. Such retrospective studies are not possible so far as the current approach to get cancer-specific epigenetic profiles via engrafting human tumors into mice cannot be applied to existing collections of frozen tumors. Characterization of epigenetic landscape in cancer has already provided insights into several important biological phenomena: formation of de novo enhancers/super-enhancers and long range epigenetic silencing during tumorigenesis. Moreover, a wide panel of ‘epigenetic’ drugs (inhibitors of EZH2, HDAC, BRD4 and CDK7) has been shown to be efficient in a number of cancer cell lines and mouse models. The next step would be to characterize epigenetic landscape in primary tumors of cancer patients and associate the observed changes with clinical information. However, this step is not possible without a method that would allow deconvolution of the signal coming from cancer and normal cells in ChIP-seq/DNAse-seq/ATAC-seq data generated for primary tumors. Creation of such a method is the purpose of this proposal. The project will include two phases: algorithm definition and validation on simulated and experimental datasets. To assess the performance of our method on experimental data, we will use mixtures of normal and cancer cell lines. Our methodology will include independent component analysis or nonnegative matrix factorization. It will account for variable copy number in cancer genomes, GC and mappability bias, variable signal-to-noise ratio between different experiments, and variable contamination of the tumor sample by normal cells.

The molecular basis of this poor prognosis is not understood but been suggested that it is associated with increased (pre-)leukemic stem cell properties. We recently have demonstrated, using the generation of a novel conditional knock-in mouse model, that ZEB2 is a true driver for T-ALL with enhanced leukemic stem cell properties. The major goal of this project is to better understand how Zeb2 drives immature ETP-ALL formation. Our preliminary data suggest ZEB2 is recruiting LSD1 containing chromatin remodeling complexes to its target promoters, thereby inducing epigenetic changes involved in the formation of (pre-)leukemic stem cells and the eventual transformation towards immature ETP-ALL formation with enhanced leukemic stem cell properties. Novel mechanistic insights in this process will provide us with valuable input for the development of novel therapeutic strategies (e.g. LSD1 inhibition) that can effectively eradicate quiescent and therapy resistant clones and ameliorate clinical care of human leukemia.

The existing improvement programmes are based exclusively on genetic markers, overlooking the fact that selection for complex traits is strongly affected by environmental conditions and that epigenetics likely account for a large proportion of the observed phenotypic variation. Non-coding RNAs (e.g., miRNAs) and cytosine methylation (5mC) and hydroxymethylation (5hmC) of DNA are key mechanisms underlying epigenetic regulation of gene expression. We have recently identified a panel of 5mCs, 5hmCs and miRNAs that are potential epigenetic markers (epimarkers) of improved growth in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). EPIMARK will evaluate the commercial feasibility of our novel kit of growth epimarkers, so that they can be applied in selective breeding programmes. This will be achieved by (i) validating the miRNA, 5mC and 5hmC epimarkers, (ii) developing an assay for their quantification, (iii) investigating the commercial and financial feasibility and (iv) developing the optimal business strategy, consolidated in a business plan. The EPIMARK kit will lead to a more efficient selection of fish in breeding programs based on growth potential, thereby increasing the profitability and sustainability of the aquaculture industry. The technology developed in EPIMARK will also open important avenues of innovation, including the use of epimarkers for selection of other superior production traits and disease resistance in Nile tilapia and in other species of commercial importance.

Although the last decade has witnessed tremendous advances in our understanding about the genetic basis of schizophrenia, we still know little about the specific underlying causes of the disease, or the changes in the brain that cause the symptoms associated with the disorder. Sequencing the genome was only the first step in our quest to understand how genes are expressed and functionally regulated. Sitting above the DNA sequence is a second layer of information (the epigenome) that mediates the regulation of when and where genes are expressed. Recent evidence has shown that epigenetic processes play an important role in mediating normal functions in the brain. Studies from my group have shown that changes to these epigenetic processes, which can directly influence the way genes are regulated in the brain, may play a role in schizophrenia. However, very little is known about the functional consequences of disease-associated epigenetic variation and the way in which this mediates the symptoms associated with disease. In this study I will investigate schizophrenia-associated epigenetic variation in disease-relevant cells to assess the impact epigenetic variation has on how specific genes function using novel gene-editing techniques. As most studies to date have focussed on just one type of epigenetic modification (DNA methylation), I also plan to profile other epigenetic modifications in the brains of schizophrenia patients that are important in determining how genes are regulated.

Overall five-year survival has remained less than 5% over the last 50 years and is the lowest of the 21 most common cancers in England. It is characterised by a dense fibrotic stroma with activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs). In addition to genetic changes, it is now increasingly recognised that epigenetic mechanisms play a major role in cancer development and drug resistance. Epigenetics can be defined as heritable changes in gene expression without a change in DNA sequence. Epigenetic control of gene expression can be via chemical alteration of the DNA (usually by methylation of cytosines) or through modifications of histones (proteins that pack the DNA into chromatin, the main component of chromosomes). Little is known about epigenetic mechanisms that are important in pancreatic cancer. The aim of this study is to identify key epigenetic drivers of chemotherapy resistance in pancreatic cancer. Using techniques to search the whole genome for histone modifications, I will study the changes in pancreatic cancer cells that show a differential response to chemotherapy. Since the tumour stroma also plays a major role in pancreatic cancer, I will also study the epigenetic mechanisms that drive the change of PSCs from a quiescent to an activated phenotype, using similar techniques as for pancreatic cancer cells. This project will provide important data to work towards our long-term aim to identify targets for novel therapeutic strategies in pancreatic cancer.

At the moment, there is no screening programme for prostate cancer outside the US and current diagnostic tests are unreliable for the early stage disease, resulting in significant late presentation and resulting mortality. There are multiple genetic changes associated with prostate cancer, including mutations in p53, p21, p73 and PTEN tumour suppressor genes, but these mutations do not explain all the observed effects on gene regulation. Chromosome conformation patterns represent early changes in epigenetic regulation during tumourigenesis. A newly discovered concept of “horizontal epigenetic transfer” showed that circulating cells may acquire epigenetic properties from tumour cells. <br />In a preliminary study we have analysed blood samples of 30 age matched non-cancer controls and 45 prostate cancer patients and identified 16 chromosomal conformations that were unique to prostate cancer patients in the loci of PTEN, APC, PSMA, MYC, SAM68, SPHK1 and SMAD4 genes. This signature (identified 16 chromosomal conformations) was then validated on an anonymised independent panel of mixed patients (n=14) and controls (n=14) and identified prostate cancer patients with 85.7% sensitivity and 92.8% specificity.<br />In this project we aim to screen for chromosomal conformations in whole blood samples of 100 prostate cancer patients and healthy controls and identify further epigenetic changes correlating with tumour presence.<br />During this visit we propose to use DNA microarray to screen for 50.000 chromosomal conformations in whole blood of prostate cancer patients and compare them with those from primary tumours. Using correlated blood and tumour samples from prostate cancer patients, we plan to investigate the biological significance of the identified signatures, correlate it to gene expression and mutations (genomics) and tumour phenotype. We specifically aim to dissect tumour-specific vs paraneoplastic components of epigenetic/genetic regulators. We will identify the conformations that have a “tumour origin” and investigate their significance by comparing them with the ones identified in blood of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients and cancer-negative controls. <br />Conclusion: As a result of this project, we hope to establish a further understanding of the role and significance of chromosomal conformations in prostate cancer progression and identify chromosome epigenetic signatures indicative of cancer presence.

The AS-associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs4648889, located in a regulatory region (enhancer) 2kb upstream of RUNX3, may explain the disease association at this locus by its allele-specific effects on transcription factor (TF) recruitment in CD8+ T-cells. This enhancer shows functional effects and contains several SNPs associated with AS. I will identify the components of the local protein-DNA “interactome” that regulate transcription and define the epigenetic landscape of the 5’ RUNX3 region modulated by AS-associated SNPs. I will use biochemical/biomolecular approaches to establish functional causality of SNPs in the 5’ RUNX3 enhancer, including 1) DNA pull-down/mass spectrometry to characterise allele-specific TF binding, 2) ChIP-seq to demonstrate effects ex vivo, 3) chromosome conformation capture to analyse chromatin interaction(s), 4) serial editing (CRISPR-Cas9 technology) of the 5’ RUNX3 enhancer, and 5) in vitro knockdown of RUNX3 to investigate its downstream regulatory effects using gene expression arrays. By investigating the AS-associated mechanisms controlling RUNX3 transcription and the regulatory effects of RUNX3 itself on downstream gene expression I expect to identify pathways that include credible therapeutic targets for future drug development.

DNA methylation is a prevalent epigenetic modification in mammals, which is brought about by enzymatic transfer of methyl groups from the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) cofactor by three known DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). The most dramatic epigenomic reprogramming in mammalian development occurs after fertilization, whereby a global loss of DNA methylation is followed by massive reinstatement of new methylation patterns, different for each cell type. Although DNA methylation has been extensively investigated, key mechanistic aspects of these fascinating events remain obscure. The goal of this proposal is to bridge the gap in our understanding of how the genomic methylation patterns are established and how they govern cell plasticity and variability during differentiation and development. These questions could only be answered by precise determination of where and when methylation marks are deposited by the individual DNMTs, and how these methylation marks affect gene expression. To achieve this ambitious goal, we will metabolically engineer mouse cells to permit SAM analog-based chemical pulse-tagging of their methylation sites in vivo. We will then advance profiling of DNA modifications to the single cell level via innovative integration of microdroplet-based barcoding, precise genomic mapping and super-resolution imaging. Using this unique experimental system we will determine, with unprecedented detail and throughput, the dynamics and variability of DNA methylation and gene expression patterns during differentiation of mouse embryonic cells to neural and other lineages. This project will give a comprehensive, time-resolved view of the roles that the DNMTs play in mammalian development, which will open new horizons in epigenomic research and will advance our understanding of human development and disease.

Accordingly, multiple studies (including my own) have described long-term negative psychological and behavioral consequences when adolescents’ peer relationships are dysfunctional. Paradoxically, knowledge on adult social consequences of adolescent peer experiences –relationships with others a decade later - is much less extensive. Informed by social learning and attachment theory, I tackle this gap and investigate whether and how peer experiences are transmitted to other social contexts, and intergenerationally, i.e., passed on to the next generation. My aim is to shed light on how the “ghosts from peer past” affect young adults’ relationships and their children. To this end, I examine longitudinal links between adolescent peer and young adult close relationships and test whether parents’ peer experiences affect offspring’s peer experiences. Psychological functioning, parenting, temperament, genetic, and epigenetic transmission mechanisms are examined separately and in interplay, which 1) goes far beyond the current state-of-the-art in social development research, and 2) significantly broadens my biosocially oriented work on genetic effects in the peer context. My plans utilize data from the TRAILS (Tracking Adolescents’ Individual Lives’ Survey) cohort that has been followed from age 11 to 26. To study intergenerational transmission, the TRAILS NEXT sample of participants with children is substantially extended. This project uniquely studies adult social consequences of peer experiences and, at the same time, follows children’s first steps into the peer world. The intergenerational approach and provision for environmental, genetic, and epigenetic mediation put this project at the forefront of developmental research and equip it with the potential to generate the knowledge needed to chase away the ghosts from the peer past.

Approximately 42,000 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer each year in the UK. The best non-invasive PCa biomarker, PSA, is relatively inaccurate with a sensitivity of 21% for all cancers and 51% for high grade disease, meaning approximately 76% or 126,000 men who have a raised PSA do not have prostate cancer. Therefore, a significant proportion of men undergo highly invasive, expensive and unnecessary biopsy to rule out the presence of disease. The development of a non-invasive epigenetic assay, has the potential to remove the uncertainty surrounding PSA testing and improve both diagnosis and treatment of men with prostate cancer (PCa). We have developed a highly multiplexed targeted sequencing assay (PACEB) to detect prostate cancer specific epigenetic alterations in cfDNA of men with this dieseas. The PACEB assay utilizes 177 epigenetically altered loci which has can discriminate PCa from normal prostate with a high degree of accuracy, and which isn&rsquo;t affected by tumour heterogeneity. The aim of this project is to show the potential clinical utility of an epigenetic cell free DNA assay to rule out the presence prostate cancer in men with a raised PSA. The use of cancer specific epigenetic biomarker has the potential to reduce the uncertainty surrounding PSA testing and decrease the number of unnecessary, invasive and expensive biopsies in men who do not have disease. It will also improve treatment by allowing the non-invasive monitoring of disease recurrence and response therapy, reducing the need for frequent, expensive imaging and allowing earlier intervention in men with progressive disease.

They are divided into two main functional complexes, PRC1 and PRC2, which are involved in the deposition of the heterochromatin-associated histone modifications on critical development-, proliferation- and differentiation-regulating genes. Phf19 is a novel member of PRC2 and it is conserved between insects and humans. It is expressed in a large number of mouse and human cell types, in particular in cancer cells. It also plays key physiological functions in regulating mouse embryonic stem cell self-renewal and their differentiation to lineage committed cells, being recruited on the promoter regions of development-specific genes. Here it regulates the deposition of histone modificationd associated both with transcriptional silencing and elongation, tuning the delicate balance between repression and activation of these critical genes. In the adult, Phf19 is expressed at higher levels in both mouse and human proliferating epidermal cells, compared with differentiated cells, and it is enriched in the bulge and isthmus regions of the mouse hair follicle, which represent a reservoir of epithelial stem cells. The aim of this project is to study the functional role of Phf19 during early development in vivo, in the regulation of adult stem cell proliferation and differentiation, and in tumour progression. We will take advantage of a conditional knockout (KO) mouse model to generate Phf19-depleted embryos and to verify its functions by phenotypic and molecular analyses during embryogenesis. Using epithelial cells as a model of proliferation and differentiation, we will then exploit the same transgenic mice to generate a Phf19 tissue-specific KO in the pre- and post-natal epidermis. These in vivo studies will then be corroborated in vitro on mouse and human cultured epidermal cells, using a combination between molecular and bioinformatic approaches, as well as loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments, to identify the Phf19-dependent regulatory network. Finally, with these procedures we also aim at identifying whether Phf19 plays a direct role during tumour progression, such as in skin cancers.

Critically, epigenetics regulates gene expression, through a series of chromatin organization, DNA and protein modifications and RNA-mediated mechanisms. It is thus not surprising that subtle alterations in these mechanisms lead to diseases such as cancer or other severe syndromes. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been demonstrated to be essential epigenetic regulators. However, analysis of lncRNA-driven mechanisms is hampered by the difficulty of identifying interacting proteins. New approaches combined to optimal research models are thus required to better understand the role of lncRNAs in development and disease.My goal is to better understand the delicate mechanisms by which lncRNAs shape our genome. I thought of developing an enzymatic-based biotinylation approach to identify RNA-interacting proteins. I established a new method, lncRNA-BioID, using proximity-dependent labeling with biotin [1] to identify lncRNA-interacting proteins by mass spectrometry. I took advantage of lncRNA-BioID to study X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), a model of first choice to study epigenetic regulation by lncRNAs. Regulated by several lncRNAs, XCI is an essential and conserved process in female eutherian mammals where Xist lncRNA induces silencing of a whole chromosome in cis. Xist expression is negatively regulated by its antisense lncRNA: Tsix, which regulates the random choice of one X-chromosome to be inactivated.I have so far applied lncRNA-BioID to both Tsix and Xist. A proteome for Tsix has not been identified to date. Up to this point, I have identified several candidate proteins for Tsix. By characterizing the function of these interacting proteins, I will be able to characterize a new epigenetic mechanism, by which Tsix antisense ncRNA stably regulates the allelic expression of its associated sense gene.This study will also allow me to demonstrate the efficiency and strength of my newly developed lncRNA-BioID technique, which has revealed new important factors necessary for Tsix lncRNA function. The proposed project is combining the development of a new proteomics method with the in-depth and hypothesis-driven characterization of newly identified factors. I expect this work to be of great interest to the epigenetics community and beyond.References:1.Roux, K.J., et al., A promiscuous biotin ligase fusion protein identifies proximal and interacting proteins in mammalian cells.

1038	Prof. Diether Lambrechts	VIB	None	2014-09-01	2019-09-01	Cellular Hypoxia Alters DNA MEthylation through Loss of Epigenome OxidatioN	DNA methylation was originally described in the 1970s as an epigenetic mark involved in transcriptional silencing, but the existence of DNA demethylation and the enzymes involved in this process were only recently discovered. In particular, it was established that TET hydroxylases catalyze the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) through a reaction requiring oxygen (O2) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG). DNA demethylation as mediated by TET hydroxylases has so far predominantly been studied in the context of stem cells, but its precise contribution to carcinogenesis remains largely enigmatic. Nevertheless, somatic mutations in TETs have been identified in numerous cancers. Tumor hypoxia is linked to increased malignancy, poor prognosis and resistance to cancer therapies. In this proposal, we aim to assess how hypoxia directly impacts on the cancer epigenome through the dependence of TET-mediated DNA demethylation on O2. First of all, we will study the effect of O2 and 2OG concentration on TET hydroxylase activity, as well as the overall and locus-specific changes of their product (5hmC). Secondly, because much of the hypoxic response is executed through HIFs, we will investigate how HIF binding is influenced by DNA methylation and if so, whether TET hydroxylases are targeted to HIF (or other) binding sites to maintain them transcriptionally active. Thirdly, we will assess to what extent 5hmC profiles differ between tumor types and construct a comprehensive panel of (tumor-specific) 5hmC sites to assess the global and locus-specific relevance of 5hmC in various cancers. Finally, since hypoxia is a key regulator of the cancer stem cell (CSC) niche and within the tumor microenvironment also promotes metastasis, we will establish the in vivo relevance of DNA demethylation, as imposed by tumor hypoxia, in the CSC niche and during metastasis. Overall, we thus aim to establish the interplay between tumor hypoxia and the DNA methylome.	European Research Council	Consolidator Grant	1920000.0	EUR

Prof. Dr. Matthias SCHAEFER	Medical University of Vienna	None	2016-04-01	2019-03-31	Biological Function of m5C RNA Methylation in Drosophila	For a long time, the information flow from DNA to protein has been conceived as a succession of mechanisms that copy/transcribe/translate genetically encoded sequence faithfully from DNA to RNA to protein. Importantly, the very building blocks of these copied sequences (nucleotides as well as amino acids) are also substrates of molecular machinery that can chemically modify their identity post-synthetically. The existence of these modifications, and ultimately their impact on interpreting/translating the underlying sequences, influences the flow of genetically encoded information through the addition of various epigenetic layers that contribute to the regulation of gene expression. Chemical and covalent modification of RNA and DNA molecules can be detected in most organisms in all kingdoms. Importantly, RNA carries 10 times more chemical modifications than DNA. The majority of these modifications involve methylated groups, which underscores the multifunctional use of a rather simple modification in biologically active molecules. For instance, eukaryotic genomes encode multiple (cytosine-5) RNA methyltransferases (RCMTs), but their biological function has remained ill defined for a long time. Recent studies have provided compelling evidence for the notion that (cytosine-5) RNA methylation is an important contributor to diverse processes such as stress responses, innate immunity and proliferation control. Most of the information about the biological function of (cytosine-5) RNA methylation has only been derived from phenotypic analyses of specific RCMT mutations. Importantly, the molecular machineries that regulate the placing, sensing and interpretation of 5-methylcytosines are unknown and remain to be characterized. The focus of this application is the systematic characterization of (cytosine-5) RNA methylation systems in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Fruit flies encode homologues for most mammalian RCMTs, and therefore provide an easily accessible entry point into the molecular characterization of RNA methylation systems in mammals. Two Drosophila RCMTs, NSun2 (CG6133) and NSun6 (CG11109), will be genetically manipulated to allow characterizing their tissue-specific and subcellular localization, to define their interactions with both protein and RNA binding partners, and to analyse their mutant phenotypes. In addition, tissue-specific RNA methylation analyses will be performed using recently developed technologies such as miCLiP and RNA-bisulfite sequencing. The characterisation of RCMT interactions and RCMT function both under normal and non-standard laboratory (i.e. stress) conditions will provide important information on the substrate specificities and functional dynamics of these highly conserved RCMTs. Understanding the biology of (cytosine-5) RNA methylation systems in Drosophila will be of great importance for elucidating the molecular mechanisms that are associated with aberrant RNA methylation patterns and their consequences for the organism.

Despite an elevated lifetime prevalence of related fear and anxiety disorders, effective treatments for traumatic memories are scarce and the mechanisms behind successful memory attenuation poorly understood. This discrepancy is particularly pronounced for remote traumata, when the original insult occurred in the distant past. Here, we propose to identify, isolate to analyze, and causally determine neuronal subpopulations involved in remote fear memory attenuation. To achieve these goals, we will use a combination of transgenic mice with direct in situ manipulations of neuronal subpopulations and cell type-specific transcriptomic and epigenetic profiling. Specifically, we will inducibly and persistently tag neurons activated by remote memory recall, and subsequently capitalize on this tag threefold: First, by visualizing this tag after successful memory attenuation, we will identify neuronal subpopulations that promote remote memory reduction. Second, by using this tag as an anchor for pharmacological manipulations interfering with neuronal activity, we will determine a causal implication of these neurons in successful memory attenuation. Lastly, by employing this tag as bait, we will isolate neuronal subpopulations that promote memory attenuation to analyze their epigenetic regulation of gene expression, a core component of enduring forms of memories. By investigating these mechanisms in three independent protocols for memory attenuation, we seek to provide proof-of-principle that successful memory attenuation is defined by a unique molecular signature, which can serve as a template to better ascertain the potential of other treatments aimed at attenuating remote memories. We expect this project to deepen our understanding of remote traumatic memories and their attenuation at an unprecedented cellular and molecular resolution.

The aim of this proposal is to deepen the understanding of mechanisms involved in microbe-induced gastric carcinogenesis, which will facilitate risk stratification for identification of high-risk groups and may offer new opportunities for pharmacological and probiotic prevention. We hypothesize that novel H. pylori genotypic variation can predict carcinogenicity. The cancer-causing H. pylori strains may no longer be present at the time of cancer diagnosis, displaced by a changed microenvironment and invading microorganisms. We further hypothesize that the composition of invading microorganisms determines the risk of stomach cancer. To test these hypotheses, we will perform a case-control study nested within a historic cohort of patients with gastric biopsies taken decades ago. For cases who developed stomach cancer several years after index biopsy and their matched controls, paraffin-embedded blocks will be retrieved for metagenomic analysis of H. pylori and other microfloras, using our new method with laser capture micro-dissection, DNA amplification and sequencing. Interactions of host response and environmental exposures with the gastric microbiome will also be checked. To explore the molecular mechanism underlying the gastric carcinogenesis, we will further examine gastric epigenetic changes and mutation profiles by novel methods which require minute amount of starting material. Moreover, we will develop non-invasive tests for infections with carcinogenic strains of H. pylori and other microorganisms, which can easily be deployed in low-resource countries. This project will not only contribute significantly to reducing the worldwide burden of this dreaded malignancy, but also broaden our understanding of the mechanisms linking infection, inflammation and cancer development, and open a door for research using the vast resources of archived pathology materials.

ILC is characterised by a loss of E-cadherin and it is generally oestrogen receptor positive. We carried out RNA sequencing on a total of 61 primary ILC tissues and found that the epigenetic reader, bromodomain protein 3 (Brd3) is associated with recurrence free survival. Aims The aim of this proposal is to assess the role of the Brd family in ILC. We aim to decipher the exact role of each Brd protein in ILC and to assess in vivo the therapeutic efficacy of targeting the Brd proteins, using the small molecule inhibitor JQ1. Techniques and Methodology To determine which Brd protein regulates cell growth and survival in ILC we will use siRNA to knockdown each of the Brd proteins. Next we will assess the transcriptional networks regulated by the different Brd proteins (Brd2, Brd3 and Brd4) in ILC by comparing RNA-sequencing following knockdown of each of the Brd proteins compared to the transcriptional effects of JQ1. We aim to assess the chromatin binding of each Brd protein by performing CHIP-sequencing to identify superenhancers that may be preferentially inhibited by knockdown of the Brd proteins. Lastly, we aim to assess the efficacy of JQ1 alone or in combination with endocrine therapy in patient-derived-xenografts of ILC. Impact on breast cancer research To date, there have been limited therapeutic developments in the treatment of ILC, with the current standard of care being endocrine therapy. We identified that high Brd3 expression is associated with recurrence free survival in ILC. Therefore, we have identified a novel therapeutic target, Brd3, which may be inhibited using JQ1, in combination with endocrine therapy for a more effective treatment strategy.

This is partly because structural/epigenetic alterations to REs appear to reactivate dormant embryonic processes such as stemness leading to chemoresistance, metastasis and dormancy. However, the reactivated REs (I dub oncoenhancers) and the mechanisms regulating their early hijack remain unexplored. Therefore, I propose to build on my previous findings to delineate and characterise oncoenhancers reactivating the Wilms’ tumour protein (WT1) in epithelial cancers. Promisingly, WT1-based immunotherapy clinical trials are underway. WT1 has topped a National Cancer Institute antigen prioritisation list because as a developmental regulator, its well-documented expression in adult tissues is restricted to few non-epithelial cell types yet it is abnormally reactivated uniquely in epithelial cancer cells. Here, we will use a well-established inducible RasG12V-transformed human mammary epithelial cell model (HMLER), where WT1 is abnormally reactivated, to a) identify using sequencing-based approaches and b) functionally characterise the WT1-associated oncoenhancers as an exemplar of RE reactivation in cancer. Future work will explore the functional relevance of oncoenhancers in maintaining the epithelial-mesenchymal balance upstream of WT1. The dissection of WT1-related oncoenhancers will be a paradigm for understanding dynamic embryonic enhancer malfunction in pathology.	Wellcome Trust	Seed Award in Science	99983.0	GBP

Cancer cells undergo a partial EMT to generate multipotent progenitors with hybrid E-M phenotypes e.g. CTCs and CSCs, which are critical for metastasis, therapy resistance and relapse. The molecular regulators that retain cells in hybrid E-M states remain uncharacterised; but their transient expression should be necessary and sufficient to maintain cells in hybrid E-M states long enough to generate progenitor cells. We hypothesise WT1 to be such a molecular regulator. This is because WT1 regulates cells undergoing EMT/MET in the embryo and maintains few adult cell-types in hybrid E-M phenotypes. And it is strongly expressed in many solid cancers including CTCs from PDAC patients. WT1 is also ranked the top oncofoetal antigen with clinical trials in many cancers showing promising results, including in PDAC. Also, we recently found that WT1 is a) sufficient to bestow potency and derive cells with hybrid E-M states , b) necessary for the E-M balance in primary PDAC in vivo, and c) a molecular switch governing EMT/MET reversibility. Therefore, we aim to define: 1. The role of WT1 in generating and maintaining the stemness window in normal and neoplastic pancreatic cells. 2. The molecular mechanisms that underlie the role of WT1 in the hybrid E-M phenotypes. Thus, we are repurposing a human pancreatic cell model known to recapitulate the multistage progression of PDAC in vitro, via organoid culture ex vivo and upon xenograft implantation in vivo. In our model, the expression of two of the commonest drivers of PDAC evolution, K-RasG12D and p53R175H, is inducible. We use xenografts as they explore late tumour stages that remain largely elusive in patients such as minimal residual disease following therapy and homing metastatic cells. This work will provide direct insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the functional roles of WT1 and similarly mis-expressed embryonic factors deployed at the nexus of metastasis, therapy resistance and relapse.

Recently metabolic changes have also been shown to couple to immune effector responses. A shift in appreciation of the role of metabolites beyond energy metabolism and biosynthetic processes has emerged. We have been examining the role of three metabolites in macrophages. We have evidence that two of these, malonyl-CoA and 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) are pro-inflammatory, whilst the third, itaconate, has profound anti-inflammatory effects. In many ways, they mirror cytokines, with malonyl-CoA and 2-HG being akin to pro-inflammatory cytokines, whilst itaconate resembles anti-inflammatory cytokines. The specificity and breadth of the role of these metabolites in macrophages will be mapped in this proposal. For malonyl-CoA we have evidence that it regulates GAPDH, IRG1/CAD (which synthesises itaconate) and the key cytokine IL-1beta. For 2-HG, we will examine the production and actions of its 2 enantiomers, D-2-HG and L-2-HG, focusing on their effect on HIF1alpha and epigenetic regulation. For itaconate we have evidence for a role in Type I interferon modulation, antigen presentation, inflammasome regulation and GAPDH and LDHA (which can produce 2-HG) activities. We also have evidence that OXGR1 is the receptor for itaconate. All of these aspects will be explored in detail. Critically we will also determine the relationship between these metabolites since we have evidence for cross-talk. Their dynamic regulation is likely to be a key aspect of how metabolic reprogramming controls macrophage function. Our studies point to a major shift in our understanding of how intracellular metabolic changes lead to inflammation. The overall aim is therefore to elucidate how metabolic reprogramming controls inflammatory macrophage activation, which may lead to new therapeutic targets for inflammatory diseases.

The key pathological feature of SSc is fibrosis, which is driven by TGF-ß as a master regulator of this process. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a recently emerging class of important gene regulators mediating their effects via a wide variety of mechanisms. LncRNAs are thought to be higher in numbers than coding RNAs, underlining their potential as master regulators of biological pathways and mediators of diseases. However, little is known about the role of lncRNAs in autoimmune and fibrotic diseases. Preliminary results: Our preliminary experiments using whole genome RNA sequencing on skin biopsies identified the novel, yet uncharacterized lncRNA 'H19X' as consistently upregulated in SSc patients versus healthy controls. The upregulation was also confirmed in lung samples from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and SSc-interstitial lung disease indicating that H19X might also be relevant for other fibrotic disorders. Stimulation with TGF-ß resulted in a strong induction of H19X in primary dermal fibroblasts in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Knockdown experiments showed that TGF-ß requires H19X to induce its pro-fibrotic effects on collagens. Hypothesis: Therefore, we hypothesize that H19X is a key driver in the pathophysiology of fibrosis in SSc and other fibrotic diseases and that H19X might represent a potential target for therapeutic interventions in TGF-ß driven fibrotic diseases such as SSc. Aims: To address these hypotheses, we aim to analyze the expression of H19X in different fibrotic diseases and correlate it with TGF-ß pathway markers. We will identify the major cellular source of H19X in tissues and localize the cellular compartment where H19X exert its function. We also want to analyze the TGF-ß response in different cell types of mesenchymal origin as well other non-mesenchymal cells and identify the TGF-b signaling pathways involved in this process. The pro-fibrotic effects of H19X will be evaluated with functional experiments using gapmer silencing and H19X overexpressing vectors. Moreover, we will address the molecular mechanisms of H19X by analyzing its function as a hosting gene for miR-424 and miR-503. Direct regulatory effects of H19X on pro-fibrotic genes will be investigated using ATAC-Seq to identify epigenetic effects on gene function and ChIRP-Seq to identify protein interaction partners of H19X. Finally, H19X will be characterized as a potential therapeutic target using 3D skin cultures and a humanized in vivo SSc mouse model.Significance: Fibrotic diseases are responsible for up to 45% of death in developed countries. Using H19X as an example, the outlined experimental setting can be used as a platform for in depths characterization of pro-fibrotic lncRNAs as one of the most rapidly emerging fields in molecular biology.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of genetic associations, but the vast majority is for regulatory DNA variants in non-coding regions of the genome and their clinical utility is limited by our poor understanding of their biological function. As such, regulatory variants are thought to be major players in determining susceptibility to complex diseases and it is imperative that methods are developed to elucidate their role and identification. Recent advances in genome information sciences, massively parallel DNA sequencing and development of disease relevant cell models directly from patients’ tissues offer new promising tools for identifying and characterizing regulatory variants underlying complex traits.The aim of my project is to study how human genetic variations affect cardiac gene expression regulation, in particular how they modify the binding of important cardiac transcription factors (TFs) and determine changes in epigenetic features. Importantly, this project will have access to a number of families with multi-generational histories of cardiovascular disease. I believe this will be one of the first attempts at studying human cardiac disease loci by using a combination of family genetics and whole genome molecular biology techniques. Operationally, the research plan consists of the following actions: 1) Derive cardiomyocytes from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from selected members of these families, to be used as cellular models. 2) Perform chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) to determine transcription factor binding site (TFBS) occupancy in iPSCs-derived cardiomyocytes. 3) Align the genome-wide readout of TFs binding activities for each individual with his/her close family members. Reproducible differences between the individuals determined by different genotypes will be identified and ranked according to how likely they are to be affecting core cardiac gene expression patterns. Predicted variations in expression regulation will be further validated by whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq).The results of this work will provide a framework for understanding how non-coding variants can affect the biology of an individual. It will give new insights on cardiac gene expression regulation, and will help to elucidate the influence of common human variations on pathways relevant for cardiac functions and diseases.

Therefore the study of disease-relevant tissues is a fundamental requisite to interpret these associations, but has so far been hampered by the lack of appropriate human cellular models. The technology of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which can be differentiated into a variety of cell types, offers a powerful, yet unexplored tool to functionally characterize human regulatory variants. My goal is to demonstrate the utility of using human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) to understand how DNA variants influence cardiomyocyte molecular phenotypes. In the first part of my postdoc in the Frazer laboratory at UCSD, I have generated iPSC-CMs from seven members of an extended family and profiled them using multiple functional epigenomic assays including RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq of two transcription factors (NKX2-5 and SRF) and one histone modification (H3K27ac), and ATAC-Seq to identify regions of open chromatin. We have also generated whole genome sequences from germline DNA of the seven family members. I am currently analyzing these datasets to assess the consistency of the iPSC-CMs in expressing typical cardiac gene expression and epigenetic signatures and to evaluate the role non-coding genetic variants play in influencing cardiac molecular phenotypes. In this fellowship, I propose to conduct further computational analyses of these datasets to prove that iPSC-CMs are a powerful model to study genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying cardiac biology and cardiovascular disease. In a second project, I am studying the molecular effect of a long QT type II mutation segregating in this family with incomplete penetrance. The mutation causes a truncation of KCNH2 resulting in NMD of its transcript. In this fellowship I propose to characterize the electrophysiological properties of iPSC-CMs from the individuals of this family to determine if there are differences between the affected individuals, asymptomatic individuals carrying the mutation and control family members.

Moreover, the epigenetic status of enhancers, promoters and genes has been tightly linked to the three dimensional organization of the DNA. Recently, it has become evident that altering these landscapes lead to pathological outcomes.

Patients harboring these mutations exhibiting 100% fatality with no effective treatment to date.

1051	Paul Franken	University of Lausanne	Centre Intégratif de Génomique Université de Lausanne	2017-04-01	2020-03-31	Genetic dissection of the epigenomic consequences of sleep loss	Although our previous work and that of others has demonstrated that many aspects of sleep, including its homeostatic regulation, are under strong genetic control, genetic variation alone is not sufficient to explain phenotypic variability. Phenotypic variability is indeed increasingly thought to be a product of the interaction of many genetic variants with each other and the environment. Similarly, the response to an environmental challenge, such as sleep deprivation, is conditioned by each individual’s genetic background. Moreover, although variants in coding regions of the genome certainly play essential roles, recent studies document the importance of variants in non-coding regulatory elements in predicting a phenotypic response. Regulatory elements (e.g. enhancers, silencers, promotors) and their activity can be readily identified by the presence of specific epigenetic marks; i.e., modifications of the DNA and the chromatin structure that do not affect the nucleotide sequence itself. The presence of epigenetic marks at genomic loci can depend on the underlying genotypes and on external influences, which makes them the long sought-after readable interface between genes and the environment.We have recently completed a project in which the effects of sleep deprivation were studied in a genetic reference population of mice to perform higher-order, system-level analyses integrating high-resolution genotype information with transcriptome, metabolome, and sleep/wake phenome data. This resource is the ideal starting point to profile the epigenomic consequences of the impact of sleep deprivation in genetically diverse individuals (Aim 1). We will profile and quantify open chromatin by ATAC-sequencing and contrast non-sleep deprived and sleep deprived conditions. We then will exploit these results to predict the transcription factors (TF) binding to the differentially accessible regulatory elements (Aim 2) by means of TF footprint analysis. The role of some of the transcription factors and regulatory elements identified under this aim in modulating the response to sleep loss can be directly validated in available mouse models or in other model species. Finally, in an already ongoing study, we aim to quantify both the short- and long-term transcriptomic and epigenomic consequences of sleep deprivation (Aim 3). Although no funding is sought for this third aim, it nevertheless is an integral part of the overall project as it allows interpreting the Aim 1 and 2 results in a homeostatic context.In addition to providing much needed new insights into the cellular basis of sleep homeostasis, this proposal is, to our knowledge, the first to comprehensively interrogate gene x environment interactions at the epigenomic level. With our approach, we are considering not only gene expression as a function of genotype and sleep deprivation, but also incorporate regulatory elements and their interactions to unveil higher-order regulatory networks and how these depend on genetic variants. The overarching aim of this proposal is thus to uncover elements, variants, and interactions (including the proteins involved), that are critical for coping with sleep loss.

1052	Peter Richards	University of Zurich	Veterinärbiochemie und Molekularbiologie Universität Zürich	2011-09-01	2014-09-30	Role of serine protease HtrA1 in the regulation of marrow stromal cell differentiation and its implications for bone disease	Background: Mammalian HtrA1 (High temperature requirement protein A1) is a secreted member of the trypsin family of serine proteases, containing both a PDZ domain and a highly conserved protease domain. Proteolytically active forms of HtrA1 have the capacity to degrade a variety of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and are potent inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and transforming growth factor-ß (TGFß) signaling. Preliminary findings from our own research have shown that HtrA1 is both expressed and secreted by primary human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) during osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, HtrA1 was shown to enhance the osteogenic differentiation of human BMSCs and resulted in a marked increase in mineralized matrix deposition. Interestingly, we have also demonstrated that secreted HtrA1 levels are reduced in human BMSCs displaying deficits in osteogenic differentiation potential. These initial studies therefore not only highlight the importance of HtrA1 in human BMSC differentiation but also offer a potential means by which HtrA1 could modulate the development and maintenance of mineralized bone. Moreover, deficiencies in HtrA1 protease activity may have significant implications for osteoporosis, where alterations in the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation potential of marrow stromal cells are considered to be an underlying cause of age-related bone loss.Working hypothesis: Based on our preliminary findings, we hypothesize that the differentiation potential of human BMSCs is critically dependent on the actions of HtrA1 and that deficits in the osteogenic capability of marrow stromal cells from osteoporotic bone are due to alterations in HtrA1 availability. We will test this hypothesis by fulfilling the following Research Aims:AIM 1 - Identify factors regulating HtrA1 expression and secretion in human BMSCs.AIM 2 - Elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which HtrA1 modulates the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of human BMSCs.AIM 3 - Validate the relevance of HtrA1 activity in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. Experimental design: The project is divided into three main sections: first, the transcriptional and epigenetic factors regulating HtrA1 expression and secretion in human BMSCs will be identified; second, the effects of HtrA1 on growth factor signaling and ECM degradation during human BMSC osteogenesis and adipogenesis will be determined; third, the influence of HtrA1 on the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation potential of diseased BMSCs from osteoporotic patients will be assessed using the various techniques and methodologies employed in Aims 1 and 2.Expected value of the proposed project: The results generated from this study will enhance our understanding of the role played by the serine protease HtrA1 in the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of human BMSCs and subsequently allow us further insight into the intricacies governing these processes. Furthermore, we will characterize the role played by HtrA1 in the pathogenesis of age-related osteoporosis thus offering the potential for development of new therapeutic strategies to combat this debilitating disease.

1053	Giuseppina Carbone	Ente Ospedaliero Cantonale	Institute of Oncology Research (IOR) IOSI	2013-04-01	2016-03-31	The ETS transcription factor ESE3/EHF as a regulator of prostate epithelial cell differentiation and stem cell properties	ETS transcription factors are nodal points of critical signaling pathways controlling cell differentiation, proliferation and survival in many cells and tissues. In the human genome there are 27 distinct ETS factors that share the highly conserved ETS DNA binding domain. Individual ETS factors, however, have also distinctive structural and functional features that manifest through positive and negative regulation of partially distinct subsets of genes. In many tissues, ETS factors constitute a complex network of transcriptional regulators with biological responses depending on the balance between factors exhibiting similar or opposite functions. Our working hypothesis is that an endogenous network of ETS factors controls to a significant extent differentiation, proliferation and survival in different cell types. An altered balance between ETS factors, which may result from environmental, genetic or epigenetic events, could then promote cell transformation and drive tumorigenesis. Cancer of the prostate is the most common cancer and a leading cause of cancer death in western countries. Mortality is mostly due to metastatic disease and presently there is great need to understand the factors governing the clinical evolution of prostate cancer and identify new therapeutic strategies. ETS transcription factors have emerged as important elements in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. About half of prostate tumors harbors chromosomal translocations involving ETS genes, the most frequent being the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion. However, the biological function of the translocated ETS in prostate tumorigenesis and their relationship with the endogenous ETS gene network have been poorly investigated. With the intent to define the ETS transcriptional network governing prostate epithelial cell differentiation and transformation, we have examined the expression of the ETS gene family in normal and prostate cancer tissue samples. In the course of this study, we identified endogenously expressed ETS factors that, in addition to the translocated ETS, could contribute to prostate tumorigenesis. Moreover, we found that multiple ETS gene alterations co-existed creating the potential for synergistic effects on prostate epithelial cell transformation and tumor progression. Specifically, we found that the epithelial-specific ETS factor ESE3/EHF, which is normally expressed in prostate epithelial cells, was down-regulated in about 50% of prostate tumors. We have now strong evidence supporting a tumor suppressor function of ESE3/EHF in prostate cancer. Expression of ESE3/EHF was reduced in Ras-transformed prostate epithelial cells and in prostate cancer cell lines. Re-expression of ESE3/EHF in these cells inhibited proliferation and clonogenic survival. More recent data from our group support a direct role of ESE3/EHF in the maintenance of prostate epithelial cell differentiation and control of the stem cell compartment. Knock-down of ESE3/EHF in immortalized human prostate epithelial cells resulted in the induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and acquisition of stem-like properties. Analysis of clinical tissue samples showed that loss of ESE3/EHF expression occurs early at the level of high grade PIN (HGPIN) and is independent of ERG rearrangement and over-expression. Moreover, prostate tumors with exclusive loss of ESE3/EHF expression have distinctive molecular and biological characteristics, including enrichment of EMT and stem-like features, suggesting that they might represent a distinct tumor subtype. Furthermore, reduced expression of ESE3/EHF was associated with significantly reduced overall survival in large cohorts of patients with primary prostate cancers suggesting that tumors with loss of ESE3 may represent a subgroup of more aggressive tumors. Intriguingly, our preliminary data in prostate cell lines support the notion that tumors with low ESE3/EHF expression may be resistant to conventional therapies including androgen blockade and cytotoxic drugs and therefore may require alternative therapeutic strategies. Taken together, these data suggest that ESE3/EHF participates in important regulatory mechanisms and encourage further studies to understand the role of this transcription factor in prostate epithelial cell differentiation and transformation. Furthermore, our data encourage further characterization of tumors with low ESE3/EHF expression to develop novel diagnostic and prognostic indicators and therapeutic strategies for prostate cancer.Accordingly, the overall project has these specific aims: Aim 1. To evaluate the consequences of ESE3/EHF loss in freshly isolated human normal prostate epithelial cells. Aim 2. To evaluate the mechanisms by which ESE3/EHF controls differentiation and stemness in prostate epithelial cells. Together the studies proposed in this application aim at advancing our understanding on the complex role of the ETS transcription factors in prostate cancer pathogenesis and at identifying novel diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic avenues for the management of this disease.

1054	Rabih Darwiche	Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology Harvard Medical School	Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology Harvard Medical School	2018-03-01	2019-08-31	Elucidating The Regulatory Circuits During Transformation and Cancer Stem Cell Formation	Cancer is characterized by abnormal regulation of cell proliferation, a process that ultimately depends on the correct expression and regulation of a large number of genes. These target genes are usually regulated by transcription factors that can act as oncoproteins or tumor suppressors. Kevin Struhl’s (K.S.) laboratory has developed an inducible cell-culture model to transform human breast epithelial cells into cancer stem cells (CSCs). This transformation involves an epigenetic switch in response to a transient inflammatory signal. This epigenetic switch is mediated by a positive feedback loop, which involves the transcription factor NF-kB, a Lin28 microRNA regulator, the Let-7 microRNA, and interleukin 6. Furthermore, this transformation process which is relevant in many forms of human cancer, is dependent on the transcriptional co-activators ß-catenin, YAP/TAZ, and S100A9/A8 that are targets of Wnt, Hippo, and calcium signaling, respectively. The central goal of my proposal is to elucidate, on a whole-genome scale, the transcriptional regulatory circuits and underlying molecular mechanisms that are involved in the processes of cellular transformation and the formation of cancer stem cells. First, I will identify direct and indirect targets of the co-activators ß-catenin, YAP/TAZ, and S100A9/A8 by using standard proteomics and genomics approaches (immuoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, ChIP-seq, and mRNA profiling). Notably, K.S. has already identified WDR77 and the arginine methylase PRMT5 to interact with ß-catenin. He also found that components of the polyadenylation machinery interact with YAP/TAZ. Based on that, I will secondly examine whether and how these proteins mediate transformation of epithelial cells into CSCs by interacting with ß-catenin and YAP/TAZ. Third, I will undertake a systematic structure-function analysis of mutant derivatives of these co-activators to examine which biological functions are necessary and sufficient for transformation. These derivatives will be essential for identifying oncogenically-relevant target genes. In summary, I propose to use this integrated set of genetic and functional genomic experiments on an inducible model of transformation and CSC formation to elucidate fundamental mechanisms in cancer progression at the molecular level. These discoveries will ultimately lead to the identification of new pathways and potential targets for therapy of cancer.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Early Postdoc.Mobility	None	None

This variable property is a defining aspect of a cell’s identity and is mainly interpreted at the level of epigenetic signature and chromatin organization. A complex epigenetic network, which includes the coordinated action of histone modifying enzymes, DNA methyltransferases and non-coding RNAs regulate cell functions throughout a person’s lifetime and establish the blueprint for the tissues of the developing embryo. Consequently, each cell has its own epigenetic pattern that must be carefully established and maintained to regulate proper gene expression. Perturbations in these carefully arranged patterns can lead to congenital disorders or predispose people to acquire disease states. Primary goals over the next decade will include improving our understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms and gene expression in physiological and pathological conditions, with the aim to create the basis for the development of therapeutic strategies directed at a wide variety of diseases, including cancer. In the past decade, long non-coding (lnc)RNAs have gained widespread attention as a potentially new and crucial layer of biological regulation. lncRNAs of all kinds have been implicated in a range of developmental processes and diseases, and in the regulation of a variety of epigenetic mechanisms leading to the establishment of chromatin conformation and epigenetic patterns that ultimately result in the fine control of genes. However, knowledge of the mechanisms by which lncRNAs act is still limited. In this project we aim to dissect epigenetic regulatory systems that contribute to the establishment of heterochromatin, a highly condensed chromosomal domain whose role has been implicated in genome stability and transcriptional gene silencing. Specifically, we will analyse the role of the nucleolar chromatin repressor TIP5 and the non-coding RNA pRNA in the regulation of nucleolar heterochromatin structure during embryonic stem cell differentiation. The results of this project will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms that cells use to program their identity through chromatin and epigenetic modifications. Moreover, these studies will provide important insights into the dynamic nature of chromatin, offering basic principles of genome organization, gene regulation and cell function as well as a clear understanding of the development of chromatin and epigenetic related-diseases like cancer, which will be instrumental for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

1056	Dr Raffaella SANTORO	University of Zurich	Department of Molecular Mechanisms of Diseas Universität Zürich-Irchel	2011-05-01	2014-04-30	Function of TIP5 in the establishment of nucleolar and nuclei chromatin structure	Epigenetic mechanisms, including nuclear architecture, chromatin structure, chromatin dynamics and histone and DNA modifications, are fundamental players for correct cellular function. Disruption of the balance of this epigenetic network can lead to inappropriate expression or silencing of genes, resulting in major pathologies, including cancer and syndromes involving chromosomal instabilities. Elucidating how the combinatorial loading of all the epigenetic factors can function will provide important insight into the dynamic nature of chromatin, and it will lead to a clear understanding of the development of human diseases. The major task of actively and dividing cells is to make proteins. For that to happen, ribosomes must be continuously produced and replenished, a process that is highly regulated at multiple levels and associated with accurate cell growth and proliferation. Control point in the complex process of ribosome biogenesis is the transcriptional regulation of ribosomal (rRNA) genes. Higher levels of rRNA synthesis are characteristic of aggressive cancer and contributes to increased production of ribosomes and protein synthesis of the rapidly proliferating tumours. Data from our and other laboratories indicated that epigenetic mechanisms regulate rRNA transcription. Our recent results showed that depletion of TIP5, the key determinant of rDNA silencing, impairs rDNA silencing, enhances rRNA transcription levels, affects nucleolar structure, promotes ribosome synthesis, increases the productivity of recombinant proteins, accelerates cell proliferation and induced a transformed phenotype. Importantly, we showed that the function of TIP5 is not only limited to the rRNA genes. We determined that TIP5 mediates formation of heterochromatin located at the perinucleolar periphery and of centric and pericentric repeats whose correct structure is required to ensure genome stability. Consistent with this, we demonstrated that TIP5-mediated heterochromatin is indispensable for stability of silent rRNA genes and of major and minor satellite repeats, protecting the genome from inappropriate chromosomal rearrangements. Taken together, these results indicated that the function of TIP5 is not only limited to the epigenetic silencing of rRNA genes but it extends its action to other important non-nucleolar chromatin regions. Moreover, they suggest that TIP5-mediated heterochromatin has a crucial role in protecting genome stability and regulating rDNA transcription and that it can play a role in the cellular transformation process.The goal of this proposal is 1- to analyze in vivo the role of TIP5 and 2- to study the role of TIP5 in initiating rDNA silencing and formation of heterochromatin of centric-pericentric repeats during stem cell differentiation. Given the tight link between i- stem cells and cancer cells and ii-TIP5/rDNA silencing with cell growth and proliferation and formation of correct chromatin architecture of pericentric and centric DNA sequences, we believe that these studies will provide important insights in processes required for correct cell function. The results of this project will lead to an understanding of the mechanisms that cells use to control their cell growth and proliferation properties and how to program their identity through chromatin and epigenetic modification. In the long term, these studies have the potential to offer new models and strategies for the development of novel therapies and provide potential molecular marker strategies to assess cancer risk and early cancer detection.

During the progress through its complex life cycle, the malaria parasite requires strict control of gene expression, but the mechanisms controlling this process remain poorly understood and unexplored for therapeutic purposes. A group of apicomplexa-specific putative transcription factors with AP2 DNA binding domain(s) (apiAP2) has been identified as major regulators of the parasite transcriptome at multiple stages. However role of the majority of the members of the family and their targets are unknown. My recent work identified that a network of at least four interacting apiAP2 proteins controls gene expression during the major bottleneck of Plasmodium life cycle – ookinete formation. Here I propose to analyse this network identifying the key apiAP2 proteins involved and their targets, binding partners and interactions with the epigenetic landscape. The resulting comprehensive model of transcription regulation at the critical stage of parasite transmission would provide valuable insights into the key aspects of parasite biology (potentially resulting in new drug targets) and generate the tools for further investigation of transcription regulation across the parasite life cycle.

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with no cure. Drugs only treat the motor symptoms of the disease and do not prevent neuronal death. Neuroprotective therapies can only be developed when we fully understand the neurodegenerative process. There is growing interest in the role of epigenetics in PD. There are two principal epigenetic mechanisms, DNA methylation and histone modification, which can regulate gene transcription. Histone acetylation by histone acetyltransferases (HAT’s) leads to chromatin relaxation promoting gene expression, whilst histone deacetylation by histone deacetylase (HDAC’s) causes chromatin condensation and suppression of gene expression. Hence, epigenetic changes can lead to the expression of cell death genes or proteins e.g.alpha-synuclein, associated with neurodegenerative process and/or the reduction in cell survival factors. There are 18 HDAC isoforms. Recently, Dexter’s laboratory has detected changes in the level of histone acetylation and the gene expression of a number of HDAC isoforms in areas of the PD brain which degenerate compared to controls. This preliminary data supports the hypothesis that aberrant epigenetic changes may be involved in PD. This project builds on this data and will assess whether there are any changes in HDAC protein levels and assess whether such changes correlate with disease progression.

Using a well-established discovery pipeline from genome wide to individual CpG sites and subsequent function, perinatal methylation at two genes (retinoid X receptor alpha gene (RXRA), essential in the action of 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D and other nuclear hormones; and CDKN2A, involved in cell senescence) has been shown to be associated with offspring bone mineral content at four years of age. However, it is unknown whether such associations persist into later childhood, whether they involve bone microarchitecture, and whether supplementation with vitamin D in pregnancy may influence these epigenetic marks. I aim to investigate whether DNA methylation at these two sites is associated with bone mass and microarchitecture at twelve years of age in the offspring of the Southampton Women’s Survey (SWS), and to test whether gestational supplementation with vitamin D, in a completed randomised controlled trial (MAVIDOS), leads to altered DNA methylation at these loci. Finally, I will use SWS data to undertake a genome-wide discovery approach to identify other CpG sites associated with bone mass and microarchitecture.

In the mid-20th century, Conrad Waddington postulated developmental mechanisms that "canalize" the phenotype in the presence of genetic and environmental perturbations, illustrated by his influential metaphor of the epigenetic landscape. Today, we know that a disruption of developmental canalization underlies a broad range of diseases. Yet the actual developmental and molecular mechanisms underlying canalization remain very poorly understood. In the proposed project, we will investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics, the quantitative genetic basis, and the clinical relevance of developmental canalization in the human head. This interdisciplinary project unites theoretical and methodological developments with the empirical analysis of a broad source of data. The first part of the project focuses on the development of a comprehensive mathematical theory that formalizes Waddington's metaphor of the epigenetic landscape and that forms the basis for a multivariate statistical estimation of the central parameters of developmental canalization. In the second part, we integrate this model into contemporary geometric morphometrics and extend existing methods for the analysis of variance patterns at different spatial scales and of symmetric versus asymmetric shape components. The third part applies the developed methodology to study canalization in postnatal cranial growth using longitudinal X-ray images. In the fourth part, we study the degree to which canalization affects genetic (i.e., heritable) versus environmental (non-heritable) shape variation, and whether the capacity for canalization is itself heritable. In a genetic association study we assess whether canalization can be traced back to a few genes or, instead, emerges as an epiphenomenon from the complex genetic-developmental interactions during ontogeny. In the final part of the project, we will study relapse - modelled as canalization towards an undesired target trajectory - in post-operative bone remodelling after craniofacial surgery (mandibular sagittal split osteotomy). This project will offer a novel strategy for modelling and studying developmental canalization. It will not only have a long-lasting impact on theoretical biology, but also allow for a fresh perspective on the development and evolution of the human head. It will offer an unprecedented quantitative approach for designing treatments with minimal relapse. The genetic analysis will offer new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying robustness in development and will demonstrate how the genotype-phenotype relationship of inherently multivariate traits can be studied.

Therefore, both organisms need to quickly and permanently adapt to these challenging conditions. Regulation of gene expression by chromatin-based (epigenetic) mechanisms, such as histone posttranslational modifications (HPTMs), is thought to enable a swift induction of virulence-/defence-associated genes during the different phases of pathogenesis/resistance. Depending on the HPTM the underlying genes are either silent or poised for transcription, suggesting that the fungal epigenetic landscape is a crucial determinant for successful host invasion. Only a limited number of studies have so far looked into this aspect of fungal-host interactions and they have found that epigenetic mutants are affected in virulence. Study of these strains has proven to be a powerful tool to reveal novel virulence-associated genes. In this project the interaction between the rice pathogen Fusarium fujikuroi and rice (Oryza sativa) will be used as a model system. F. fujikuroi is the causal agent of bakanae disease (chlorosis and hyperelongation) on rice resulting in huge crop losses. Some- but not all - symptoms of the disease are related to the production of the plant hormone gibberellic acid (GA) by the pathogen. Not much is known, however, regarding GA-independent virulence factors in this pathosystem. F. fujikuroi has at least 46 additional secondary metabolite gene clusters and hence the capacity to produce many metabolites, of which some might confer virulence in addition to GA. By using a set of mutants with an altered HPTM profile the underlying mechanisms required for the successful F. fujikuroi-rice interaction will be investigated in this project. Initial virulence assays will define hypo- or hypervirulent strains. Morphological characteristics during infection will be studied by confocal microscopy and progression of the infection will be determined. The transcriptome of hypo-/hyper-virulent mutants will be compared to the wild type during infection by RNA-sequencing. Genes associated with the infection process are likely to be among the set of differentially regulated genes, and thus, may represent novel virulence factors. To be able to directly correlate the changes in the transcriptional network with the chromatin status we will employ Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of the fungal chromatin during the pathogenic growth (in planta ChIP), thereby shedding light on the epigenetic mechanisms that take place directly during the fungal-plant interaction. A small set of target genes that show this significant correlation between changes in transcriptional activity and epigenetic marks will be chosen for a more detailed functional characterisation. This project will, thus, reveal new basic information on the epigenetic regulatory level of the fungal pathogen interaction with a host plant.

A key source of regulation of transposable elements is the family of KRAB domain-containing zinc finger proteins (KRAB-ZFPs) and KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP1). KRAB-ZFPs recognize specific transposable elements and recruit KAP1, which controls the assembly of an epigenetic silencing complex including histone H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1. The chromatin remodeling activities of this complex repress transcription of the targeted transposable element and any adjacent genes. We have performed a detailed and quantitative set of biochemical and structural analyses on the tripartite motif (TRIM) of KAP1. Our preliminary data show that KAP1 forms homodimers through a coiled coil domain. Moreover, KAP1 dimers assemble into higher-order oligomers via B-box domains, and KAP1 forms a tight 1:1 complex with the KRAB domain. However, the structure and composition of the KAP1 repressor complex, and how its assembly impacts the structure and physicochemical properties of its chromatin binding site, remain unknown. Here, we propose to identify the molecular mechanisms through which KAP1 recruits and activates chromatin-modifying enzymes at target transposable elements. We will determine three-dimensional structures at near-atomic resolution of a KAP1/KRAB-ZFP retrotransposon recognition complex, and a repressor complex containing a KRAB-ZFP, KAP1 and SETDB1, by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy. We will design structure-based mutations to identify functionally important structural features and protein interaction interfaces with biochemical and cell-based functional assays. Our work will provide a detailed mechanistic understanding of how KAP1 represses transcription of transposable elements. Reactivation of transposable elements can cause serious human disease. This work will inform the design of compounds that inhibit pathogenic activation of transposable elements.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	795031.0	GBP

A benefit of an intensive longitudinal epigenome and microbiome study is that it makes it feasible to test if the loss of balance in epigenome and microbiome during respiratory viral infections (stress state) can be used to determine how long viral infections have a lasting effect on an individual and if these dynamic changes induced by viral infection can be correlated with viral burden. In addition, type 2 diabetis (T2D) is a major public health issue that is not well explored epigenetically especially in an intensive longitudinal fashion in combination with dynamic changes of microbiome during periods of healthy and disease states. We anticipate identifying epigenetic perturbation for certain categories of genes (e.g. genes involved in glucose metabolism and/or insulin signaling pathways) by comparing the epigenetic state between diabetic and nondiabetic states. We also anticipate that respiratory viral infection may cause dynamic changes in specific biological pathways in the human body, and these changes may lead to alteration of the human gut microbiome. The alteration of human gut microbiome may modify the risk for T2D. In fact, having the two events (respiratory viral infections and prediabetic states) in the same individuals will open the opportunity to find a possible link between the start of viral infection and the onset of T2D. The outcome will identify novel molecular pathways that change during the onset and progression of T2D and respiratory infections that could not be identified by studying a large population of samples at a single time point.

Chromatin functions in chromosome segregation by providing DNA with a highly compact form and in epigenetic inheritance by acting as the principal substrate for post-translational modifications. Transformation of the hierarchical structure of chromatin between discrete states is crucial to gene regulation, particularly as regards development and disease. My laboratory investigates the molecular structure of chromatin and its interacting nuclear factors. The ‘Bonus of Excellence’ would enable us to establish the structural and mechanistic bases of chromatin transformations. Specifically, we would focus on 1) the cryo-EM structure of the chromatin fiber, 2) the crystal structure of the tetranucleosome containing a linker DNA-binding histone protein, 3) the cryo-EM structure of the chromatin remodeling complex Isw1a bound to a dinucleosome, and 4) and the X-ray structure of the histone methyltransferase Dot1 bound to a nucleosome.

The cells responding to these instructive signals in turn activate transcriptional targets, which can interact with or inhibit the signals and/or relay information to more distant cells. The developing vertebrate limb bud is an excellent model to study the complex interactions that coordinate proliferative expansion of progenitors with survival and their fates. To analyse these processes, we combine state-of the-art mouse molecular genetics with biochemical approaches to perform genome-wide analysis of the interactions of transcriptional mediators of signaling pathways with the cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) of their target genes. Our research aims to understand how diverse signaling inputs and gene regulatory interactions are integrated into the precise but at the same time dynamic spatio-temporal expression of key regulators during limb bud development. The proposed research for this BoE grant is the continuation of our currently on-going research, but also incorporates several novel and innovative aspects. The major aims are:1. Initiation of limb bud development: we have uncovered the HAND2 transcriptional target gene network that compartimentalizes the limb bud upstream of activating SHH signaling. Interestingly, we have evidence for a significant overlap between the HAND2 cistromes that control early limb bud and heart development. Therefore, we propose an in-depth analysis of this shared limb-heart gene regulatory network (GRN) to get functional insights into the underlying common morpho-regulatory mechanisms. Furthermore, genetic evidence from Hand2 loss-of-function mutations in mouse and zebrafish embryos indicates that the link between limb/fin bud and heart development is evolutionary ancient, which is a second focus of our Hand2 analysis. 2. The Grem1 cis-regulatory landscape - a key node for signal integration in the self-regulatory signaling system that controls mouse limb bud development: the Grem1 cis-regulatory landscape is our paradigm to study how trans-acting inputs from all pathways in the self-regulatory limb bud signaling system are integrated into a transcriptional output during progression of limb bud development. To this aim we combine the analysis of LacZ reporters with loss-of-function genetics and the profiles of trans-acting factors (see below), epigenetic marks and chromatin architecture to define the specific and shared functions of the CRMs that co-operatively regulate Grem1 expression and their contributions to limb skeletal patterning. 3. Analysis of the SMAD4 (BMP/TGFß) and ß-Catenin (WNT) cistromes during initiation and termination of limb bud development: we will identify and functionally analyse the CRMs, associated transcriptional target genes and GRNs controlled by SMAD4 chromatin complexes during initiation and termination of limb bud development as our previous genetic analysis has revealed key functions for SMAD4-mediated BMP signaling during these stages. In parallel, we will identify and study the ß-Catenin cistrome as we have shown that the WNT pathway is required for maintaining Grem1 expression during handplate development and is involved in digit patterning. In particular, we will identify and functionally analyse the CRMs in the Grem1 cis-regulatory landscape that are controlled by BMP /SMAD4 and WNT/ ß-Catenin during mouse limb bud development.4. Modulation of BMP activity by the BMP antagonists Grem1 and Noggin during digit patterning and chondrogenic differentiation: our analysis and studies by others have provided evidence for an important role of these two BMP antagonists in modulating BMP activity during the initiation of digit ray formation and chondrogenesis. Therefore, we will combine temporally controlled genetic inactivation of these two BMP antagonists in mouse embryos with FACS isolation of limb bud mesenchymal- and osteogenic progenitors and early chondrocytes in high-density cultures. We will study the functional relevance of the antagonistic modulation of BMP activity during initiation and progression of digit ray formation and chondrogenesis. The research proposed here takes a holistic approach and should provide fundamental insights into the dynamics of signaling and the transcriptional interactions that ensure robust and stereotypic development of tetrapod limbs, but still permitted tinkering with these interactions during evolutionary diversification. Our main research focus remains the robust and self-regulatory limb bud signaling systems that coordinates proliferation of mesenchymal progenitors with specification and initiation of differentiation. We study the GRNs and signaling systems that control limb bud development to gain insight into how vertebrate organogenesis is orchestrated and how embryonic progenitors integrate signaling inputs into a dynamic, but at the same time robust transcriptional response. The outcome of these studies will be relevant to the directed engineering of cartilage and bone from adult mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs). Furthermore, a mechanistic understanding how the dynamic Grem1 expression in limb buds is controlled will be of general relevance, as its deregulated expression results in diseases and contributes to development and/or malignant progression of tumors.

1067	Thomas Schalch	University of Geneva	Département de Biologie Moléculaire Faculté des Sciences Université de Genève	2016-07-01	2017-06-30	The nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation complex SHREC	Every cell needs to control the transcriptional output from its genome carefully, and adapts to environmental and developmental cues by modifying its gene expression program. In eukaryotes, chromatin remodeling and modification play an essential role by controlling access of transcription factors, repair enzymes, and replication machinery to the underlying DNA. How chromatin remodeling complexes exert their diverse functions is still poorly understood. In this project we pursue a structure-function approach to reveal the molecular mechanisms used by the Snf2/histone deacetylase (HDAC)-containing Repressor Complex (SHREC) in establishing a transcriptionally silent chromatin state in the heterochromatic regions of the fission yeast S. pombe. S. pombe uses a unique epigenetic system that is driven by the RNA interference machinery and chromatin modifiers, with SHREC being primarily responsible for transcriptional gene silencing through histone deacetylation and nucleosome remodeling. SHREC thus serves as a paradigm for Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylation complexes, the NuRD/Mi-2 complexes in higher eukaryotes, which play essential roles in development, aging and diseases such as cancer.The chromatin remodeler Mit1 and the histone deacetylase Clr3 together with Clr1 and Clr2 proteins form the core of SHREC, which is recruited to heterochromatin through interaction with the HP1 homologue Chp2 and the telomere-binding protein Ccq1. These recruitment mechanisms stand in contrast to the NuRD complexes, which are recruited through transcriptional coregulators, the metastasis-associated proteins (MTA), and Methyl-CpG-Binding (MBD) domain proteins. In the first period of the SNF professor grant preceding this proposal we have characterized the SHREC complex in structural detail. We have mapped the interaction domains between the SHREC core subunits, and have determined structures of the Mit1-Clr1 interface, of the Clr3 HDAC and of the Clr1-Clr2 complex. Intriguingly, the Clr2 structure reveals an MBD-like domain with double stranded DNA or RNA binding activity required for heterochromatin silencing, thereby revealing a striking parallel to NuRD complexes. Based on our findings I propose the following three aims for the prolongation of the SNF professorship grant:Aim 1: Determination of structure and activity of the holo-SHREC complex. Why is it advantageous to combine HDAC and remodelers into a single complex? We propose to structurally and biochemically investigate the holo-SHREC complex and compare it with the behavior of individual subunits.Aim 2: Quantitative description of the recruitment mechanisms used by SHREC and their significance for silencing. We postulate that Clr2's MBD-like domain is part of a SHREC recruitment mechanism similar to MBD3 recruitment of NuRD. What is the nucleic acid target of the MBD-like domain of Clr2? Using ChIP and CLIP based approaches we want to to characterize Clr2 binding to chromatin in vivo and want to compare it to Chp2-based recruitment.Aim 3: Addressing the functional relevance of Clr3 dynamics. Why does the Clr3 HDAC possess such a highly dynamic active site? Why does Clr3 associates in a highly dynamic fashion with the SHREC core? We propose to answer these questions quantitatively using structural, biophysical and functional approaches.	Swiss National Science Foundation	SNSF Professorships	351664.0	CHF

In 2012, malaria caused over 200 million clinical cases and close to 700’000 deaths, mostly among young children in sub-Saharan Africa. Human-to-human transmission of malaria parasites via Anopheles mosquitoes represents the biggest obstacle for efficient malaria control. Infection of the insect vector requires the obligate ingestion of mature sexual precursor forms called gametocytes via the blood meal. Gametocytes are constantly produced during human blood infection where asexually replicating parasites undergo unlimited vegetative growth. During each round of proliferation a small subset of parasites undergo an irreversible switch from vegetative growth to cell cycle exit and sexual differentiation. This provides a continuous source of mature gametocytes, which are the only forms capable of infecting the mosquito vector and are therefore essential for malaria transmission. The regulatory basis of this cell fate decision process has long remained one of the largest mysteries in the biology of malaria parasites. Recent seminal work now uncovered AP2-G, a key transcription factor essential for gametocyte commitment. The switch from asexual proliferation to gametocyte differentiation is controlled through an epigenetic mechanism that regulates the expression of AP2-G. In asexual parasites, the ap2-g locus is silenced by heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), an evolutionary conserved regulator of heritable gene silencing. Conditional depletion of HP1 is sufficient to activate AP2-G expression and to cause an irreversible switch to sexual differentiation. The main goal of this research proposal is to elucidate the molecular basis of the sexual conversion switch in P. falciparum, which causes the most virulent form of malaria in humans. I will realise this by pursuing three major objectives designed to identify the mechanisms responsible for heritable silencing and activation of the cell fate decision factor PfAP2-G and to investigate the role of PfAP2-G in early differentiation of malaria transmission stages. I propose a multi-faceted approach combining innovative reverse genetics methods with high throughput sequencing and proteomics technology and automated fluorescence imaging. This will identify regulatory factors and processes involved in the mechanism establishing silenced chromatin at the pfap2-g locus and in the upstream molecular pathway triggering activation of PfAP2-G expression. Furthermore, I will elucidate the direct consequences of PfAP2-G activation on the transcriptional and chromatin landscape in early gametocytes. The anticipated results will deliver unprecedented insight into this crucial and unique cell fate decision processes and will uncover new possibilities for the discovery and development of transmission-blocking drugs. Importantly, since pfap2-g is conserved in all Plasmodium species the acquired knowledge will most likely also be valid for other species infecting humans including P. vivax.

Research in the genome-informed era of malaria revealed fascinating novel insight into strategies of parasite gene expression and suggested their importance in the dynamic adaptation of the parasite to the various environments encountered during life cycle progression. However, our knowledge of the actual mechanisms that regulate gene expression in P. falciparum is marginal. Our research focuses on elucidating the epigenetic control processes that regulate mutually exclusive and clonally variant expression of surface antigens involved in virulence and immune evasion. A key factor in this pathway is P. falciparum heterochromatin protein 1 (PfHP1). Amongst other functions, HP1 proteins are well established mediators of heterochromatin formation and heritable gene silencing in eukaryotes. In P. falciparum, this function of PfHP1 plays a fundamental role in parasite survival in the human host. PfHP1 silences transcription of hundreds of genes implicated in host-parasite interactions, including the major virulence gene family var, and thus prevents premature exposure of the diverse antigenic repertoire to the host’s immune system.According to our current knowledge, this is the only recognized function for PfHP1. The research proposed here pursues two main objectives: we will elucidate (1) how PfHP1 actually establishes heterochromatin and silencing; and (2) if PfHP1 executes additional roles in parasite biology apart from virulence gene silencing. To answer these key questions we will conduct a detailed functional analysis of PfHP1 by combining biochemical, molecular and cell biology approaches with reverse genetics and high throughput-based analyses. Specifically, we will (1) reveal potential roles for PfHP1 in cell cycle progression and development-specific gene regulation. To do this, we will map the genome-wide PfHP1 occupancy at high resolution in different stages of the intra-erythrocytic cell cycle and in gametocytes, respectively; (2) identify and characterize proteins that interact with PfHP1 in vitro and in vivo to understand how PfHP1 executes silencing and other functions. This aim will be complemented by mapping and characterizing post-translational modifications of PfHP1; and (3) investigate the function of PfHP1 and its individual domains by conditional knock-down, functional complementation and allelic replacement approaches. The anticipated results will contribute to a better understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms responsible for phenotypic variation in P. falciparum. Moreover, according to the vast knowledge about the diverse functions of HP1 in model eukaryotes, they will provide important new insight into essential and hitherto uncharacterized nuclear biology in this important and evolutionary divergent pathogen.

Tropen und Public Health-Institut	2015-10-01	2018-09-30	Exploring the mechanisms of heritable gene silencing and singular gene choice to understand antigenic variation in malaria parasites	The protozoan parasite Plasmodium falciparum causes the most severe form of malaria in humans and is responsible for 200 million clinical cases and 600’000 deaths annually. Proliferating blood stage parasites, which are responsible for all malaria-related morbidity and mortality, use epigenetic control of gene expression as their prime strategy to secure their own survival and transmission. We have shown that the parasite ortholog of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), an evolutionary conserved regulator of heterochromatin formation and heritable silencing, plays a fundamental role in this strategy; PfHP1 provides the epigenetic framework for clonally variant expression of hundreds of genes implicated in parasite adaptation to changing environmental conditions. The hallmark example is antigenic variation of the major virulence factor PfEMP1, which is encoded by 60 var gene paralogs per parasite genome. PfHP1 silences transcription of all var genes except for one locus, which is activated in dedicated perinuclear zone believed to constitute a singular var expression site (VES). Switches in singular var activation lead to antigenic variation of PfEMP1. Through this sophisticated system, P. falciparum prevents premature exposure of the antigenic repertoire and secures continuous immune evasion and chronic infection. Our research focuses on elucidating the molecular mechanisms that determine and modulate the function of PfHP1 in heterochromatin formation and reversible gene silencing and activation. Whereas PfHP1’s role in heritable silencing is well established, the processes responsible for recruitment and local eviction of PfHP1, as well as the existence and molecular composition of the proposed VES remain unknown.The research proposed here pursues two main objectives. Firstly, we will identify and characterise PfHP1 interaction partners and posttranslational modifications in vivo in order to understand the mechanisms responsible for the dynamic regulation of PfHP1 function. Secondly, we will gain novel insight into the elusive mechanism of mutually exclusive var gene transcription/singular var gene choice. To achieve this we will use complementary approaches and combine molecular biology, cell biology and biochemical techniques with state-of-the-art reverse genetics tools as well as high throughput approaches. Specifically, we will (1) experimentally confirm the interaction between PfHP1 and four potential PfHP1-interacting factors recently identified in our lab and characterise their role in heterochromatin formation and heritable silencing; (2) will investigate the in vivo role of PfHP1 phosphorylation and sumoylation in modulating PfHP1’s role in heterochromatin formation and heritable silencing; (3) we will test the hypothesis that the active state of var gene transcription is heritable via association with the VES in a PfHP1-independent manner; (4) we will attempt to identify and confirm protein components of the VES; and (5) we will identify and characterise a DNA-binding protein that was previously identified in our lab and has a potential role in singular var gene choice. The anticipated results will deliver an in-depth understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms responsible for phenotypic variation in P. falciparum, and in particular for antigenic variation of PfEMP1.

The complementary expertise of the principal investigators in this research proposal will enable a comprehensive chain of analyses starting with i) an accurate clinical and pathological analysis of the phenotypes under investigation, ii) the use of cutting edge genetic analyses for the investigation of the causative genetic variants and iii) the functional validation of the molecular pathogenesis using high-throughput expression studies and innovative in vitro studies combined with a profound expertise in stem cell biology and skin homeostasis.The skin is the largest organ of the body and its integrity is crucial for survival. In humans hundreds of genetic defects, many of them monogenic, have been identified which affect both the skin and its appendages (such as the hair follicles). However, for many inherited skin diseases or genodermatoses, the affected genes or gene functions remain unknown, precluding precise diagnosis and impeding adequate therapy.The dog (Canis familiaris) has gained attention during the last ~10 years as a very attractive model organism in forward genetics studies. About ~400 registered dog breeds are kept as strictly isolated populations with a limited amount of inbreeding, which favors the expression of recessive alleles. The population structure of purebred dogs is also ideally suited to identify the underlying causative genetic variants by hypothesis-free positional cloning approaches. Due to their close physiological similarity with humans a “One Health” approach involving the genetic analysis of spontaneous dog mutants with skin-related phenotypes thus offers a chance to unravel unknown genetic variants with relevance for the human skin.In our proof-of-concept preliminary experiments we have recently identified two new causative genetic variants in the dog, which have not been reported in humans and for which the molecular function in skin homeostasis is unknown: Hereditary nasal parakeratosis (HNPK) and hereditary footpad hyperkeratosis (HFH) represent differentiation/keratinization defects. HNPK and HFH are caused by missense mutations in the SUV39H2 and FAM83G genes. SUV39H2 is a histone 3 lysine 9 methyltransferase and thus most likely involved in the epigenetic chromatin silencing during keratinocyte differentiation. Our research in dogs provided the first link of SUV39H2 to the epidermis and represents a starting point for the investigation of the molecular pathogenesis in SUV39H2 deficient patients. While SUV39H2 was at least biochemically characterized, the biochemical function of FAM83G is still completely unknown. We now plan follow-up experiments to further clarify the function of these genes and the encoded proteins. In this context we will also screen human patients with unsolved palmoplantar keratoderma for the presence of disease-associated FAM83G variants.During the three year period of this proposal, we also plan to identify the causative genetic defects for several new hereditary human and canine genodermatoses affecting both the epidermis and the hair coat. We further propose to address the functional relevance of genes with unknown function in skin and hair follicle homeostasis using cutting edge in vivo and in vitro approaches such as high-throughput RNA sequencing and functional mouse studies as well as clonal analysis of primary skin and hair follicle stem cells utilizing organoid cultures. The identification of the causative genetic defects in humans or dogs will provide new candidate genes for the diagnostics of future cases in human and veterinary medicine and a better understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlation. Finally, the molecular and functional analyses in a “One Health” approach involving a uniquely qualified interdisciplinary team of experts represents the first step and an essential prerequisite towards the development of rational therapies.

However, in my recent longitudinal study, less than one-third of individuals with young adult ADHD had ADHD persistent from childhood, while over two-thirds did not have the disorder in childhood. Many questions remain as to the nature of persistent and 'late-onset' ADHD. The aim of my proposed project is to combine data from large-scale genetic studies with a population-based cohort study to investigate the persistence and emergence of ADHD in young adulthood. More specifically, I aim: (1) to assess whether late-onset ADHD is associated with: (a) childhood ADHD polygenic risk score, suggesting childhood and late-onset ADHD share genetic aetiology, or (b) polygenic risk scores for other mental health disorders, such as alcohol dependence and depression, which would suggest late-onset ADHD may be accounted for by other psychopathology that mimics ADHD in young adulthood; (2) to utilize genetic data available in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium to perform GWAS analyses examining ADHD age of onset as a quantitative trait, as well as to examine whether ADHD polygenic risk score is associated with age of onset among clinical cases of ADHD; (3) to determine whether risk and protective factors in the social environment moderate genetic risk, as assessed by ADHD polygenic risk score, for the emergence and persistence of ADHD in young adulthood; (4) to investigate whether DNA methylomic variation: (a) is associated with polygenic risk score for ADHD in a population-based cohort study, and (b) differs between monozygotic twins discordant for late-onset ADHD (n=49 pairs). This project has important implications and opportunities for researchers and clinicians in understanding young adult ADHD. Investigating the genetic and epigenetic underpinnings of young adult ADHD will provide invaluable insights that will affect the direction of future research and could influence clinical decision-making.

It reduces quality of life, increases morbidities and risk of developing colorectal cancer placing significant burden on healthcare. The exact mechanism of this disease is still unknown. Complex interaction between genetic predisposition, environment factors and intestinal microbiota are believed to play role in causing immune dysregulation within the mucosa. Recent work in our laboratory has shown that there is a down-regulation of BRINP3 in colonic mucosal of UC patients compared to healthy controls. This finding was irrespective of the presence or degree of mucosal inflammation indicating that low expression of BRINP3 is unique to UC and may be playing an important role in pathogenesis. We have also shown that the low expression of BRINP3 in the mucosa is caused by increased methylation. The role of BRINP3 in humans is currently unknown. Aims: 1. Determine the molecular and physiological role of BRINP3 in bowel mucosa and how it affects the function of the bowel mucosa and immune response in mice 2. Characterise the gene regulation and role of BRINP3 in colonic epithelial cells Methodology: The changes in cell proliferation, permeability and inflammation of the colonic mucosa will be examined using BRINP3 knockout mice and well characterised models of experimental colitis. The regulation of BRINP3 gene expression will be studied at the mRNA and epigenetic level. I will investigate the protein complexes and regulatory processes involving BRINP3 in colonic epithelial cells through the generation of reporter constructs, biochemistry and confocal microscopy.

The Polycomb group proteins are transcriptional repressors playing critically important roles in the control of stem cell activity and their differentiation into specialized cell types. By interacting with each other and forming multi-protein complexes, they mediate histone modifications leading to chromatin compaction and gene silencing. Here, we will test a hypothesis that Polycomb group gene Cbx4 is a critical determinant that controls maintenance of epithelial identity and the proliferative activity of the skin epithelial SCs during physiological and injury-induced skin regeneration via two Specific Aims: 1. Define the role for Cbx4 in the maintenance of proliferative activity, epithelial identity and differentiation of skin epithelial SCs during hair cycle-associated skin regeneration. 2. Identify the role of Cbx4 in balancing between epidermal commitment and epithelial-mesenhymal transition in epithelial SCs during wound healing. To address these aims, we will generate genetically modified mice with the deletion of Cbx4 in K14+ and K15+ skin epithelial SCs. In addition to mice, we will use ex vivo human skin wound and 3D organotypic models to assess the role of Cbx4 in human skin maintenance and regeneration. Together, this study will allow us to comprehensively analyse the consequences of Cbx4 loss in skin SCs for normal physiological and injury-induced regeneration. This project will provide new important insights into fundamental mechanisms that regulate SC activity inside and outside of the skin, and will serve as an important platform for the development of new epigenetic drugs to target stem cells for the needs of regenerative medicine.

In other tumour models, it is known that, upon damage and/or oncogenic stress, differentiated cells may undergo de-differentiation (gain of plasticity) acquiring malignant phenotypes. Since cell senescence is a response to damage and stress, and senescent cells can secrete pro-inflammatory and pro-tumorigenic factors, we hypothesize these cells can also induce in nearby cells de-differentiation processes favouring lung cancer initiation. Our specific aims are: (i) To induce lung de-differentiation processes upon damage (urethane treatment) and/or oncogenic stress (K-Ras activation). To do so, we will employ a regrogrammable mouse model transiently expressing the four Yamanaka factors. We will determine whether reprogramming-induced de-differentiation is an oncogenic promoter. (ii) To capture early tumour cells expressing transiently or stably de-differentiation markers by using a lineage tracing mouse strain and FACS approaches. Cells will be subjected to RNAseq analyses and epigenetic techniques such as chromatin immunoprecipitation. (iii) To address the interplay between cell senescence and de-differentiation processes during lung tumorigenesis. Senescence will be manipulated both genetically and chemically during lung cancer initiation. Lineage tracing approaches will allow us to perform longitudinal studies on the activation of pluripotency markers and how it relates to senescence. We will determine if senescence-induced plasticity is an important oncogenic promoter. (iv) To identify factors secreted by senescent cells able to induce de-differentiation of nearby cells and/or malignant transformations. Microdissected sections of tumours from control and senescence-manipulated mice will be subjected to gene expression and protein arrays. Conditioned media from cultured senescent cells will be subjected to SILAC analyses.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	875070.0	GBP

Investigate how abnormal epigenetic gene regulatory mechanisms result in differentiation block and leukaemic transformation in IDHm AML. 2. Investigate the molecular mechanisms of action of mutant IDH inhibitors in inducing differentiation of AML, focusing on effects on transcription factors involved in normal granulocyte-monocyte (GM) differentiation. Methodology 1. Compare gene expression, DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility, performed in parallel (multi-genomics) in normal bone marrow versus AML. Perform unbiased genome-wide bioinformatic analysis, and analysis focused on differentially expressed transcription factors required for normal GM differentiation (GM-TFs) but suppressed in AML. 2. Test the hypothesis that failure to express GM-TFs results in leukaemic transformation using CRISPR knockdown of candidate GM-TFs in IDH1-mutant preleukaemic mouse model. 3. Perform multi-genomic sequencing on mIDHi-treated AML LSC in vitro to investigate how mIDHi upregulates GM-TFs. Identify GM-TFs upregulated with mIDHi in responsive AML samples but which remain repressed in non-responsive samples. Test if re-expression restores response in resistant AML samples. 4. Correlate GM-TFs required for response (from point 3) with gene expression in IDHm AML patients who are resistant to mIDHi treatment in vivo. These may be important targets for novel therapies. Applications and benefits This work will improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of differentiation block and its contribution to pathogenesis of AML. It will help explain why differentiation therapies may not cure patients. The data has the potential to identify new genes/ pathways that should be targeted by novel therapies to improve clinical outcomes. It will provide the rationale for design of future clinical trials of combination therapy. Multi-genomic characterisation of patients may be useful as a prognostic tool, and to guide therapeutic decisions.	Medical Research Council	Fellowship	1273871.0	GBP

Computational methods will reveal DNA-copy number landscapes and structural rearrangements from the single-cell sequences. To study the nature and extent of transcriptomic instability in human AD and primary Tauopathy brains, we will apply single-cell resolution spatial transcriptomics to tissue sections of those same brains. Spatial transcriptomics enables molecular imaging of the full mRNA transcriptome in a tissue section by sequencing. To identify somatic mutations in cells that may cause neuropathology, we will employ whole genome (and targeted) sequencing approaches on single neurons isolated from different areas of a subject's brain. Specifically, we will analyse subjects with no family history of AD or Tauopathies, and no causal germline mutation. To determine the role of Tau/Tau pathology in (i) transcription regulation, we will apply spatial transcriptomics to brains of WT, KOTau and THY-Tau22 mice; and (ii) mitochondrial and genomic DNA integrity and repair, as well as (iii) chromatin organization, we will apply a diversity of techniques as e.g. immunostaining on brain. To determine the molecular mechanism by which Tau induces genomic instability, we will (i) characterize the human Tau-induced mitotic aberrations in Drosophila larval neuroblasts and developing photoreceptor neurons, (ii) identify genetic suppressors of hTau-induced spindle defects and genomic instability in Drosophila, (iii) characterize the human Tau-induced mitotic aberrations in a Tau inducible neuroblastoma cell line, (iv) characterize human Tau-induced mitotic aberrations in embryonic brains in the humanized genomic Tau mouse model, and (v) subject brain tissue from Drosophila and mouse models to single cell genome sequencing.

1078	Dr. Etienne Bucher	University of Basel	Botanisches Institut Universität Basel	2011-02-01	2014-01-31	Investigating the tissue specific epigenetic code in plants	Epigenetics encompasses a variety of molecular mechanisms that provide an additional layer of information superimposed on the genetic code. These mechanisms are conserved among eukaryotes and enable mitotic and meiotic inheritance of gene expression states. This characteristic plays an important role in specification and maintenance of cell fate. Epigenetic repression of transcription also plays an essential role in suppressing transposon activity, which could otherwise have deleterious effects on the host organism (Mirouze et al, 2009). This transcriptional repression can bring endogenous genes under epigenetic control when transposons integrate in their vicinity. This type of regulation of gene expression is very general and has been observed in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Weil & Martienssen, 2008). Furthermore, epigenetic control of gene expression has been shown to play an important role in cancer (Davalos & Esteller, 2010). The plant Arabidopsis thaliana has proven to be an ideal organism to study how epigenetic control of gene expression works at the molecular level. This is due to the fact that complete removal of certain epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation, is not lethal in plants, while it is in mice for instance (Jones & Takai, 2001). This allowed the detailed study of a remarkable example of epigenetic memory, which involves the propagation of DNA methylation patterns in plants through cell division. In recent years mutant screens have identified numerous factors involved in maintenance and initiation of epigenetic codes (Matzke et al, 2009). In this way much general knowledge has been acquired about the role of epigenetic control of gene expression at the organism level. While there are some reports proposing a tissue specific epigenetic code in plants (Caro et al, 2007; Costa & Shaw, 2006) this has so far not been investigated systematically.The aim of this project is to gain understanding on how epigenetic states are set up and maintained in differentiated plant organs (such as roots, leafs, flowers and stems), individual tissues and cell lineages. In order to address this, Arabidopsis will be used as an established model system that has excellent genetic tools available. The project will be based on an essential, epigenetically controlled and highly tissue specific reporter transgene in Arabidopsis. The reporter construct contains the promoter of the aforementioned essential gene that also includes part of a transposon. Recent data suggest that by crossing transgenic plants containing this reporter construct into epigenetic mutants, the tissue specificity of the reporter transgene can be changed. In order to identify novel epigenetic factors that control tissue specific gene expression, these plants have been mutagenized and are currently being screened for new expression patterns. So far, 38 putative mutant plants with 8 different expression patterns have been identified. Interestingly, most mutants show strong developmental defects, indicating that important developmental factors are involved. The project will focus on screening for more mutants and mapping mutations to identify the genes involved. Developmental and molecular characterisation of mutants will be carried out using state of the art technologies such as transcription profiling based on tiling arrays, genome wide DNA methylation analysis of individual tissues and biochemical approaches. This research project will give fundamental insights into the mechanisms of epigenetic coordination of development and the role of transposons in this process.

Prof.Dr. Sabine ZÖCHBAUER-MÜLLER	Medical University of Vienna	None	2012-04-01	2017-03-31	MicroRNA gene silencing in NSCLC patients	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, noncoding RNAs which act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, thereby affecting various biological processes. So far, in humans ~ 1000 miRNA genes have been identified and it has been shown that altered expression of certain miRNA genes may be involved in tumorigenesis. In lung cancer, downregulated expression of numerous miRNA genes has been reported recently. However, knowledge about the mechanisms of miRNA gene silencing is still limited. It has been suggested that besides others, epigenetic changes, particularly DNA methylation (referred to as methylation), may lead to miRNA gene silencing in lung cancer. Thus, in a preliminary study we investigated expression of ~ 800 miRNA genes before and after treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) A549 cells with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2´-deoxycytidine (Aza-dC) or the combination of Aza-dC and the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. We observed that the expression of 41 miRNA genes was upregulated after drug treatment suggesting that the expression of certain miRNA genes is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. In addition, using methylation-specific PCR analysis we found miR-193a frequently methylated in primary NSCLCs. Overall our preliminary results demonstrate that certain miRNA genes are methylated in primary NSCLCs. The method for detecting genome-wide methylation used in our preliminary study requires proliferating cells and thus is only suitable to analyse cell lines but not to analyse tissues samples. However, a new method for detection of genome-wide methylation which can also be used to analyse tissue samples was described recently. This method combines methylated DNA immunoprecipitation with microarray (MeDIP-chip) analysis. To obtain further insight into the significance of methylation mediated miRNA gene silencing in NSCLCs, we plan to investigate genome-wide methylation of miRNA genes in primary tumors and matching non-malignant lung tissue samples of 50 NSCLC patients by MeDIP-chip analysis. Certain miRNAs will be selected for further analyses in NSCLC cell lines as well as in additional tumor samples. Major aims of this study are 1. to analyse if miRNA genes are tumor-specifically methylated in primary NSCLCs and if methylation leads to miRNA gene silencing, 2. to investigate if tumor-specific methylation of certain miRNA genes is of prognostic and/or clinical significance for NSCLC patients, and 3. to determine if certain by tumor-specific methylation silenced miRNA genes have tumor cell growth suppressing properties. Overall, we expect that the results of this project will enhance the understanding of the impact of methylation mediated miRNA gene silencing on the pathogenesis of NSCLCs and may potentially influence future treatment strategies of NSCLC patients.

However, there is no published data in connection to dogs which live in the actual social environment of humans. Based on former results, the dog model is suitable for studying genetic factors of certain human traits, such as impulsivity, but environmental effects on epigenetic (DNA methylation pattern) modifications have not been studied in canines. The proposed project aims at understanding the interaction between genetic factors and environmental effects on the social behavior of dogs and wolves kept in different social conditions. We will compare dogs living in captive packs with or without human leading or as only pets with owners who control their dogs with different strength. Dogs and wolves raised by humans but living in packs under identical condition will be also involved in order to investigate the evolutionary origins of dog-human relationship. We plan to identify genetic and epigenetic markers associated with the animals’ social behavior recorded in standardized test situations. The proposed interdisciplinary project relies on a close collaboration between the ethologists of the Messerli Research Institute, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna and the Wolf Science Center in Austria and the molecular geneticists at the Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, Institute of Medical Chemistry, Molecular Biology and Pathobiochemistry, Semmelweis University in Budapest, Hungary. One of our aims is to create the Canine Social Behavioural (CSB) Biobank which we plan to use in further international collaborations. The biobank will contain DNA samples as well as detailed behavioral, hormonal, genetic and epigenetic data of about 300 dogs and wolves kept is different social environments. This project will give a unique possibility to test an animal model of social environmental effects. Since dogs live in a social environment shared by humans and they show social behaviors analogous with human patterns, the social behavior of human-kept dogs is most probably more relevant to human social behavior phenotypes compared to that of monkeys kept in captivity or of rodents kept in laboratory settings. If we can detect similar epigenetic changes in the DNA methylation levels of selected gene regions as a consequence of adverse environment in dogs and humans, it will mean a break-through in modeling impairment of human social behavior, which is important in a range of mental health disorders, such as autism. The closer relationship of dogs and humans will enable us to model delicate changes in the social environment, and it will also represent a less expensive model compared to primate models.

The study identified the escalating UK incidence of 3-4% per year and was pivotal in characterising the natural history of islet autoimmunity thereby facilitating accurate prediction for therapeutic intervention trials. Changing environmental determinants, particularly those early in life, underlie the increasing incidence but such changes are difficult to measure in a single generation. BOX allows the changing phenotype of type 1 diabetes to be studied over several generations in the same families. We seek funding to consolidate the existing resource along with prospective follow-up of the next generation; from pregnancy onwards to allow early-life influences to be studied in these “at risk” families. This will provide a unique resource of current and historical samples which will allow genetic susceptibility, changing environmental influences and their impact on immunophenotype to be measured in the same families over time. Another novel aspect of this study will be longitudinal collection of DNA, serum and gut microbiome samples for measurement of the dynamic effects of environmental epigenetic influences in prenatal and early life. This innovative biomedical resource will underpin future efforts to prevent type 1 diabetes.	Diabetes UK	Project	474706.0	GBP

Recent evidence shows that resident macrophages can originate from embryonic progenitors and be maintained in tissues long term by local proliferation independently of monocytes. This self-renewal ability, however, appears to decline with age, with potentially major consequences for the response to infection, the resolution of inflammation and the ability for tissue regeneration. Understanding the decline of self-renewal in the aging macrophage may thus hold key elements for maintaining healthy tissue integrity. Drawing from analogies to stem cell self-renewal we want to decipher the molecular and cellular parameters of macrophage self-renewal and its decline with age. We want to understand the age-associated changes in gene expression and epigenetic identity of tissue macrophage populations with the ultimate goal to reverse age dependent decline in self-renewal and function. Results from my laboratory have identified transcription factors that control the access to a network of self-renewal genes that are also used in stem cells. Using several complementary genetic mouse models tapping into this network we want to investigate whether its activation in resident macrophage population in vivo can rejuvenate their self-renewal capacity and revert aging related changes. These approaches will be complemented by unbiased genome wide screens in vivo using latest generation CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology to identify new signaling pathways guiding macrophage self-renewal and aging. Using innovate combinations of genetics and adoptive transfer protocols we will test whether this knowledge can be employed to reverse macrophage dependent loss of immune competence and failed tissue regeneration with age. Our results will lead to new general insight and potential novel cellular therapies for degenerative diseases.	European Research Council	Advanced Grant	2499994.0	EUR

Of these, AP-2gamma appears to play a major role in breast cancer being expressed in a large proportion of primary tumours. However, relatively little is known about the target genes regulated by AP-2gamma and its overall function. ChIP-chip assays will be performed in order to identifiy promoters regulated by AP-2gamma while TAP analysis will be carried out to characterise the protein complex containing the AP-2gamma factor. Follow up studies to test for functional significance of the newly identified AP-2gamma associated proteins and genomic regions will involve coimmunoprecipitation and ChIP assays and DNA binding assays, i.e. EMSA. The involvement of AP-2gamma in the epigenetic regulation of one of its known target genes, p21/CDKN1A will be analysed. The proposed studies have great potential to reveal new insights into the molecular mechanisms mediated by AP-2gamma in the development and progression of breast cancer.

Treatment is critically reliant on androgen receptor (AR) signalling inhibition but virtually all patients become resistant (castration resistant prostate cancer, CRPC) to initial androgen deprivation. Subsequent treatment options exist but the disease remains lethal (median 2-3 years) after transition to CRPC. CRPC therapeutic options include the ‘new generation’ AR antagonist enzalutamide. However despite proven efficacy virtually all patients develop clinical resistance. Enzalutamide/AR antagonist resistance mechanisms include activating AR splice variants and point mutations. Intense interest currently surrounds the AR-V7 splice variant which lacks a ligand (or enzalutamide) binding domain leaving a constitutively active N-terminal. Recent data indicated that AR-V7 detection in blood is associated with complete loss of biochemical response to enzalutamide, or the CYP17 inhibitor abiraterone, and reduced survival. We have explored epigenetic modification of persistent AR dependent transcriptional activation in CRPC. Specifically, lysine (K)-specific demethylase 1A (LSD1), is an epigenetic AR co-activator which modifies chromatin structure at AR target genes. It’s over expression is a poor prognostic factor in prostate cancer. Our pilot data show that LSD1 chemical inhibition suppresses prostate cancer cell growth, synergises with AR antagonists/enzalutamide and inhibits AR signalling. Critically, in AR response element reporter assays, we have now found that LSD1 inhibition reduces activation of both wild type AR and the enzalutamide resistant AR-V7 splice variant. We therefore hypothesise that LSD1 co-activation of the AR is retained and is therapeutically targetable in CRPC despite resistance to new generation hormonal therapy. This now requires development, validation and investigation for other constitutively activating AR point mutations and splice variants. Aims: To establish which clinically relevant AR antagonist resistance mechanisms in CRPC retain targetable LSD1 co-activation of AR function as a basis for clinical investigation with a hypothesis driven patient selection strategy. Methods: We will analyse LSD1 chemical inhibition in AR response element luciferase reporter assays with a panel of co-transfected AR point mutant and splice variants. We will undertake validation in prostate cancer cell line models with characterised AR abnormalities including siRNA depletion and enzyme dead LSD1 models. How the results of this research will be used: As LSD1 inhibitors now have entered phase I clinical trials, these results would be used to support clinical development in AR antagonist/enzalutamide resistant CRPC. We also aim to generate a patient selection strategy hypothesis for testing during clinical evaluation of this approach.

The most common leukaemic disruptions of the MLL1 gene are chromosome translocations that fuse the N terminus of MLL1 in frame with over 40 different partner genes creating novel fusion proteins. Recent work has suggested that wild type MLL1 and MLL1 fusion proteins cooperate in leukaemogenesis by together causing aberrant epigenetic profiles at target genes in vivo. Epigenetic changes are often defined as heritable changes in gene expression or chromosome stability that don’t alter the underlying DNA sequence. We are interested in identifying the key molecular events in MLL1 mediated leukaemogenesis in order to fully understand the epigenetic basis for this disease. This major goal has been divided into three key questions: 1) What key downstream gene targets are essential for MLL1 mediated leukaemogenesis?; 2) how do MLL1 and MLL1 fusion proteins control epigenetic gene regulation on a molecular level?; and 3) how are MLL1 and MLL1 fusion proteins recruited to important gene targets in the cell? To answer these questions, we are using xenograft transplant assays to identify Leukaemic Stem Cells (LSCs) in MLL1 patient samples, ChIP-seq to identify and characterise direct gene targets in specific haematopoietic cell populations, small molecular inhibitors and siRNA combined with ChIP and ChIP-seq to determine how MLL1 fusion proteins regulate gene targets in the cell and MLL1 domain analysis coupled with genome wide techniques to determine how MLL1 is recruited to gene targets in the cell. Answering these questions may not only be useful for future therapeutic strategies, but will also inform our basic understanding of epigenetic gene regulation during normal stem and progenitor cell development.

DNA methylation, or 5-methylcytosine, is an epigenetic modification essential for mammalian development, generally associated with the silencing of genes and retrotransposable elements. Oxidation of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine by the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of enzymes has recently been demonstrated, but little is known about the role of TETs and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in the regulation of retrotransposons. My work has shown that LINE1 retrotransposons are enrich ed for 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in mouse embryonic stem cells. I plan to test the role of TETs in regulating LINE1s in embryonic and neural stem cells, where both 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels and LINE1 activity are high, and to investigate how TETs are specifically targeted to LINE1s. To assess how targeting of retrotransposons by epigenetic modifiers influences neighbouring gene transcription, I plan to develop methodology for profiling DNA modifications at individual retrotransposon copies in a genome-wide manner. I also propose to test the importance of DNA methylation on genome integrity during embryonic development. Failure to maintain epigenetic control of retrotransposons may lead to developmental defects, but a clear relationship has not been established. This work will lead to a better understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms that underpin the roles of retrotransposons in health and disease.	Wellcome Trust	Sir Henry Dale Fellowship	978166.0	GBP

As an independent Principal Investigator I have developed unique systems to better investigate the process of induced pluripotency. This resulted in the identification of Nanog and culture environment as key players and has helped re-define our understanding of the biological roles of Oct4. As a senior principal investigator I want to build on this platform and on exciting new findings from my lab. Specifically, I will focus on mecha nisms of induced pluripotency and on parallels with in vivo phenomena. 1-Define mechanistically the cell state transition leading to the acquisition of a naive pluripotent cell state. New data from our lab shows that Nanog and culture environment work synergistically on reprogramming mechanisms. We also found that depending on the culture environment, defined ES-level of Oct4 expression instructs either a naive pluripotent cell state or cell differentiation. My aim is to further explore t he relationships between key players and understand how the observed reprogramming mechanisms are regulated. I also want to fully define the direct molecular reprogramming mechanism of Nanog by investigating how its interactions with co-factors, mostly epigenetic regulators, affect its capacity to reprogram. 2-Investigate parallels between mechanisms of reprogramming and analogous biological processes. We were the first to draw a parallel between induced pluripotency and embryonic developm ent. Our future aim is to investigate how general is this concept by assessing if identified nuclear reprogramming mechanisms are recapitulated during the acquisition of the naive epiblast in the early embryo.

1088	Bernhard Schmid	University of Zurich	Institut für Umweltwissenschaften Universität Zürich	2016-04-01	2018-01-31	Fundamental biological causes of changing plant diversity-productivity relationships	Global environmental change and biodiversity loss can interactively affect the functioning of ecosystems, potentially threatening the provision of ecosystem services supporting human well-being in the future. However, ecosystems also have the potential to buffer or adjust to change through modified composition, from phenotypic plasticity of individuals to evolutionary responses of populations and changed abundances of species. Ongoing long-term biodiversity experiments such as the Jena Experiment in Germany show that plant diversity-productivity relationships change through time and across abiotic environments. Yet, the mechanisms underpinning these changes, in particular the potential for evolutionary responses of species to promote ecosystem functioning, remain elusive.In my previous research, we discovered that loss of plant diversity in experimental grassland ecosystems can generate different selection environments leading to rapid evolutionary change and contribute to the temporal change in diversity productivity relationships. I further hypothesized that negative density-dependent processes within plant species, namely plant-soil feedbacks, could be an important component of the selective environment at low diversity, while at high diversity the selective environment is predominantly driven by competition between plant species. Furthermore, the differential selective environments may have generated trade-offs between pathogen defense traits and traits to avoid plant-plant competition. The objective of subproject A in the current proposal is to investigate 1) genetic and epigenetic differences and 2) altered plant-soil feed-backs between plants that have been selected in low vs. high plant diversity in the Jena Experiment. In subproject B, I want to test whether abiotic environmental change such as drought or warming can change the diversity-productivity relationship and to which extent such changes are based on plant plasticity or evolution. This subproject will make use of 1) a long-term drought experiment within the Jena Experiment from which plant material will be collected and tested in a common environment and 2) a new biodiversity experiment in Tibet, which we established with Chinese collaborators from plants of the same species and ecotypes but collected at different altitudes.Together, the two subprojects will contribute to a better fundamental understanding of the key question how plant species and ecosystems may adjust to global change and biodiversity loss. The proposed research spans 22 months up to my retirement. It concludes third and fourth years of work of two PhDs and with the help of a Postdoc synthesizes long-term research on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

We seek funds to acquire a 4th wave of brain MRI from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936, a large group of relatively healthy subjects in their early eighties, all of whom were born in 1936 (N=1,091 at recruitment). The cohort has a wide range of phenotypic data from older age (at 70, 73, 76, 79) including cognitive, genetic, epigenetic, lifestyle, physical and medical, with MRI data at ages 73, 76 and 79. Uniquely, they also have a measure of childhood intelligence from age 11. A fourth brain MRI scan (at 82) confers important benefits - multi-wave, multi-modal MRI data is lacking for people in their 9th decade. The longer duration and extra sampling point gives greater statistical power to detect small associations with determinants, and with which to characterise patterns of brain ageing more precisely. The availability of longitudinal retinal imaging, carotid ultrasound, blood pressure, medical history, blood assays (e.g. S100B, inflammation) can be combined with longitudinal MRI markers of vascular pathology to give key information about neurovascular ageing at age 82, and to identify the preceding brain hallmarks, determinants and consequences using multivariate latent growth curve models. This 4th brain MRI will be undertaken on the same GE 1.5T clinical scanner as in previous waves. We will derive measures of brain atrophy, cortical thickness, surface area, volume, and perivascular, subcortical and white matter hyperintensity volume, and diffusion parameters (including peak width of skeletonized MD) for a range of major white matter tracts from the structural, diffusion tensor (DT), magnetization transfer (MT) and quantitative T1-mapping sequences. We also aim to conduct a 1.5T-3T scanner comparison on a subsample to allow backwards-comparable 3T scanning in future waves.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	596355.0	GBP

Although OL precursor cells (OPCs) can initially promote remyelination in MS, this regenerative mechanism eventually fails in progressive MS. OPCs go through several epigenetic states that ultimately define their potential to differentiate and myelinate. OPCs in progressive MS stall in a distinct epigenetic state, incompatible with differentiation and remyelination. We hypothesize that these OPCs regress to an epigenetic state reminiscent of the state of embryonic OPCs, which remain undifferentiated. In this proposal, we aim to uncover the causes behind the remyelination failure upon disease progression in MS. We will determine the epigenetic/transcriptional states of OPCs during development and in MS, using single cell and bulk RNA sequencing and quantitative proteomics. We will further investigate how the interplay between transcription factors (TFs), chromatin modifiers (ChMs) and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) contributes to the transition between epigenetic states of OPCs. The results will allow the identification of ChMs and ncRNAs that can modulate these states and thereby control OPC differentiation and myelination. We will use this knowledge to investigate whether we can reverse the epigenetic state of OPCs in MS, in order to promote their differentiation and remyelination. The unique combination of leading-edge techniques such as SILAC coupled with immunoprecipitation and mass-spectrometry, single-cell RNA sequencing, ChIP-Sequencing, among others, will allow us to provide insights into novel epigenetic mechanisms that might be underlying the effects of environmental and lifestyle risk factors for MS. Moreover, this project has the potential to lead to the discovery of new targets for epigenetic-based therapies for MS, which could provide major opportunities for improved clinical outcome of MS patients in the near future.

I aim to understand how chromatin can self-duplicate and be inherited. Defining the mechanisms by which chromatin components are instructive in maintaining memory is fundamental to our understanding of genome stability and cellular differentiation. In the first two aims, I focus on the mammalian centromere which is an excellent model for self-templating epigenetically-inherited chromatin, based on the histone H3 variant CENP-A. I will ask two fundamental questions: i) how can centromeric chromatin be initiated de novo? ii) how is it subsequently stably inherited? In the final aim, I will use my expertise in centromere biology to ask how heritable chromatin contributes to the mitotic transmission of active gene expression. I will employ a unique, interferon-inducible gene expression model that results in long-lasting memory of prior induction. I will discover how local chromatin structure cooperates with the transcriptional machinery to ensure robust, long-term maintenance of active transcription and determine its importance for innate immunity. Combined, our discoveries will define the molecular basis and role of chromatin inheritance in the maintenance of cell identity and genome architecture.

Prof. Dr. Gregor KASPRIAN	Medical University of Vienna	None	2018-11-01	2021-10-31	Epigenetic control of brain wiring: role of miRNAs in FASD	Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are conditions that can occur in a person whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy. It is known as a “hidden disability”, which often goes undiagnosed until school age. Affected children are usually identified when they are referred for a learning disability or an attention deficit disorder. As individuals with FASD enter adulthood, they show increased vulnerability to secondary neuropsychiatric disorders. If clinicians can identify FASD earlier, intervention approaches can be taken to minimize adverse neurobehavioral outcomes and prevent complications later in life. The goal of this project is to identify structural and molecular signatures of alcohol-induced defects on the fetal brain that will assist prenatal recognition and detection of FASD. It is centered on the hypothesis that aberrant development of axonal connectivity may be part of the neural underpinning of the deficits associated to FASD. While it is recognized that prenatal exposure to alcohol can affect many steps in neural development (ie. proliferation, migration and survival), it is unknown if and how alcohol affects the assembly of the brain circuits that shape our behaviors. The development of advance neuroimaging techniques has started to reveal structural brain abnormalities and white matter defects, mainly affecting the Corpus Callosum (CC) commissural tract, in FASD children and adults. However, to date it is not known whether pathological structural features and connectivity defects can be detected in the brain of fetuses exposed to alcohol. In addition, the mechanisms by which alcohol may affect prenatal wiring of neuronal circuits remain unknown. Interestingly, alcohol interferes with several epigenetic mechanisms, including microRNAs, which recently emerged as key regulators of axonal development. About half of the known FASD-deregulated miRNAs are expressed in the axonal compartment of neurons and therefore represent potential candidates to mediate connectivity defects in this condition. The proposed work program will combine clinical imaging research and experimental approaches on animal models to investigate the effects and mechanisms of action of prenatal exposure to alcohol on the development of brain connectivity. The translation of preclinical observations to early human development requires the deployment of specific quantitative fetal in vivo and in utero neuroimaging techniques in order to detect subtle changes in structure and function of the developing humanbrain. The group of Gregor Kasprian (Medical University of Vienna, Austria) uses various advanced MR imaging approaches to study fetal brain development. They have pioneered the field of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography and clinically implemented this technique to visualize the developing white matter macroanatomy of the human fetal brain in vivo and in utero. This imaging technique is currently the most promising approach to detect and characterize early brain alterations associated with FASD. The group of Fanny Mann (Developmental Biology Institute of Marseille, France) studies the fundamental mechanisms and molecules directing axonal growth and guidance in the mouse. They develop models of alcohol exposure at stages of wiring of young neurons, which will be instrumental to evaluate the effect of alcohol on axon navigation and targeting at cellular resolution, complementing the human data, and to study the biological function of FASD-deregulated miRNAs in these processes. The results of this program will increase our understanding of the fetal brain abnormalities induced by maternal alcohol consumption and their underlying molecular mechanisms. They will contribute to the establishment of early imaging based markers for prenatal detection and diagnosis of FASD. This is expected to contribute to reduce disease burden and its significant socioeconomic costs for families and society.	Austrian Science Fund FWF	None	372666.0	EUR

LncRNAs have been shown to play important roles in various biological processes and disease. Recently, lncRNA expression was shown to be highly individually variable compared to protein-coding genes. Given the regulatory potential of lncRNAs, it is possible that their high expression variation contributes to the expression or epigenetic variation of other genes and eventually to the formation of variable phenotypes. Additionally, lncRNA expression is highly sensitive to environmental changes, which might suggest a role for lncRNA in adaptation. In this project, I aim to investigate the basis of the high lncRNA expression variation and its role in organismal natural variation. While I have done my previous research in humans, this system is limiting when it comes to in vivo functional analyses. However, Arabidopsis thaliana is a convenient well-accepted system for studying natural variation and adaptation, and the lab of Magnus Nordborg, the scientific director of the GMI, Vienna, Austria, and a leading specialist in plant population genetics and adaptation, provides an optimal environment for my project. I will use the data from the 1001 Genomes collection of >800 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions with the corresponding genome, transcriptome and methylome data created by Nordborg group and collaborators to address the questions of the project. The main question of the project – what is the role of lncRNAs in natural variation in Arabidopsis thaliana? I will first annotate lncRNA from many natural accessions and use this annotation to profile lncRNA expression and variation in the 1001 Genomes data. I will then perform genetic and epigenetic analyses to understand why lncRNAs are more variable than protein-coding genes. Using the lncRNA annotation and expression profiles, I will perform systematic correlation analyses and apply stringent filtering to identify lncRNAs that may regulate genes and contribute to expression/epigenetic/phenotypic variation in Arabidopsis thaliana and experimentally confirm the 10 strongest candidates. This project will be the first systematic investigation of lncRNA variation and its role in plants and will uncover dozens of potentially functional lncRNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana experimentally confirming several of them. The results of this project will contribute to moving towards the understanding of what role pervasive lncRNA transcription plays in adaptation and evolution – the subject strikingly poorly investigated given the hype about lncRNAs. I will be leading this project under the supervision of Magnus Nordborg. My experimental work will be supported by the lab manager Ilka Reichardt-Gomez and two technicians in the lab: Viktoria Nizhynska and Joanna Jagoda. I will perform part of this project abroad, at the Salk Institute in the US.	Austrian Science Fund FWF	None	234210.0	EUR
1094	Dr. Nicole AMBERG	INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AUSTRIA	None	2018-12-01	2021-11-30	Role of Eed in neural stem cell lineage progression	The neocortex displays a remarkable degree of cell-type diversity, with different populations of neurons, glial cells and adult neural stem cells arising through sequential production by neural stem cells termed radial glial progenitor cells (RGPs). The detailed mechanisms underlying stem cell lineage progression and generation of cell type diversity remain unresolved. Epigenetic modulation plays an essential role in stem cell lineage specification and subsequent cell differentiation. Histone modifications comprise one of three major epigenetic features, which in a spatiotemporal manner define whether chromatin will be present in an active or repressed state. Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) 1 and 2 sequentially induce stable histone methylation-mediated gene silencing. All PRC core components were shown to exert essential functions in silencing of differentiation-associated genes, since dysfunctional PRC abolishes Polycomb-mediated silencing in developmentally relevant genes. In addition to its function as a core component in PRC2, EED contributes to PRC1 recruitment, thereby enhancing the silencing capacity of Polycomb. However, the role of Eed in corticogenesis was never investigated in an in vivo context. Therefore, we aim to address the role of Eed in neural stem cell lineage progression in vivo for the very first time, by investigating RGPs and their progeny at single cell level using Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers (MADM). MADM is a method for generating genetically mosaic mice, in which sibling Eed mutant and wild-type cells are labeled with different fluorescent markers. It is a powerful tool that enables analysis of gene function at single cell resolution in vivo, making MADM a unique system to assess the cell autonomous function of genes of interest. By also generating MADM-labelling in wild-type and Eed conditional knock-out animals, we are able to characterize the phenotype of Eed-deficient cells either surrounded by a normal environment in the genetic mosaic mouse, or by a knock-out environment in the classical conditional knock-out approach. We can thereby identify and dissect potential cell autonomous from non-cell autonomous effects in a quantitative and qualitative manner at single cell resolution. In this study, I aim (1) to investigate the cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous effects of Eed on RGP lineage progression and cellular output on the population and clonal level by applying histological analysis; and (2) to identify critical factors regulated by Eed in RGPs and neurons in a timely fashion by investigating RGP gene expression profiles as well as the epigenetic landscape at various timepoints. Taken together, I aim to specifically address which cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating neuronal and glial output are controlled by Eed during distinct steps of corticogenesis. Nicole Amberg will lead the project, to be undertaken at the IST Austria. Simon Hippenmeyer (co-applicant) will act as mentor and support the applicant in her career development.

In addition we wish to follow up on our observations on the semaphorins and their receptors through a studentship. Our small pathology laboratory (Project 5) will continue to support tissue analysis for the above projects, and those with our collaborators. The level of funding requested for these studies is equivalent to our current staff support. We are proposing one new area, which brings together the current group’s expertise in breast cancer with Dr Hamilton’s expertise in RNA interference, to investigate siRNA directed epigenetic gene silencing of tumour suppressor genes in breast cancer. For this we are requesting an additional postdoctoral scientist and a technician. After only three years a number of interesting leads have been identified. We have had to make difficult choices and have decided not to pursue our work on transcription factors, but to concentrate on mammary gland biology and breast cancer, where we have more expertise. TSC22 will be followed up in collaboration with Kevin Ryan at the Beatson Institute and Bruce Whitelaw at the Roslin Institute, through alternative sources of funding. Overall there will be 5 projects, including: Project 1: The role of the Reelin pathway in mammary gland development and breast cancer. Project 2: Annexin A8 in mammary gland development and breast cancer. Project 3: The Role Of RNA Interference In Epigenetic Silencing In Breast Cancer.

This refers to the maturation of the female germ cell or oocyte, which undergoes two rounds of meiotic chromosome segregation and, following fertilization, is converted to a mitotically dividing embryo. We aim to establish an innovative research program that addresses fundamental questions about the molecular processes controlling the mammalian oocyte-to-zygote transition to ensure faithful inheritance of genomes from one generation to the next. We are taking an interdisciplinary approach combining germ cell and chromosome biology with cell cycle and epigenetic studies to understand how maternal factors regulate chromosome segregation in oocytes and chromatin organization in the zygote. A molecular understanding of key players regulating these processes is a requisite step for investigating how their deterioration contributes to maternal age-related aneuploidy and infertility. Aneuploidy is the leading cause of mental retardation and spontaneous miscarriage. The current trend towards advanced maternal age has increased the frequency of trisomic fetuses by 71% in the past ten years. A better understanding of mammalian meiosis is therefore relevant to human reproductive health. A special feature of the female germ line is that meiotic DNA replication occurs in the embryo but oocytes remain arrested until the first meiotic division is triggered months (mouse) or decades (human) later. The longevity of oocytes poses a challenge for the cohesin complex that must hold together sister chromatids from DNA synthesis until chromosome segregation. We specifically aim to: 1) elucidate how sister chromatid cohesion is maintained in mammalian oocytes, 2) identify mechanisms regulating cohesion in young and aged oocytes, and 3) investigate how the inheritance of genetic and resetting of epigenetic information is coordinated with cell cycle progression at the oocyte-to-zygote transition.

Desvergne, F. Gilardi, N. Guex, A. Thomas. SUMMARY In the last 30 years, the incidence of obesity has enormously risen worldwide. While not being a disease per se, obesity is one important risk factor for the appearance of the metabolic syndrome, which diversely combines dyslipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and the type 2 diabetes. The mechanistic links between obesity and metabolic disorders are still the focus of intense research, as it should identify new means of prevention, and possibly of therapies. Along this line, growing evidence shows that obesity is accompanied by a systemic and low-grade inflammation, also called “metaflammation”, which contributes to the onset of obesity-related metabolic complications and for which the visceral adipose tissue plays a key role. While the pathways activated by metaflammation that interferes with normal metabolism and disrupts proper insulin signaling have been extensively characterized, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that initiate the inflammatory response in obesity, although this process is thought to start in metabolic cells, more particularly in adipocytes. Interestingly, there are accumulating reports linking nutrition, cellular metabolism and epigenetic control of gene expression. Finally, small metabolites are increasingly recognized for their role in affecting cell transcriptional responses. Thus, the central hypothesis of this application is that the changes in metabolite intracellular concentration in adipocytes, triggered by high caloric food intake and obesity, are linked to specific epigenetic alterations that ultimately result in the activation of the inflammatory response in the adipose tissue. The long-range goal of our investigations is to decipher the connection between over-nutrition and the initiation of the inflammatory response in adipose tissue.To explore this hypothesis, we propose a multifaceted approach organized under the following specific aims:1.Identification of the epigenetic signature promoted by excessive nutrient intake (HFD) in white adipose tissue, correlation with the appearance of chronic inflammation markers and exploration of the possible causal links. In this part, we will expose groups of mice to a high fat diet, to induce obesity. Analyses will compare the visceral adipose tissue, prone to inflammation, and the sub-cutaneous adipose tissue, known to be much less susceptible to inflammation, along three time points. A series of epigenetic markers will be evaluated, using ChIP-seq, with the aims of characterizing the genome-wide epigenetic effects of a HFD and how they evolve along the time course of the nutritional challenge. In parallel, systemic and local inflammation markers will be assessed, and adipose tissue RNA-seq will provide an unbiased evaluation of gene expression. These data will allow addressing the link between epigenetic modifications and onset of the nutrition- or obesity-driven inflammation. 2.Identification of metabolite changes triggered by excessive nutrient intake, correlation with the appearance of chronic inflammation markers and exploration of the possible causal links. Using the experimental setting described in aim 1, visceral WAT, subcutaneous WAT and plasma will be collected to exhaustively investigate the metabolome changes associated with the pathophysiological status. Multiple profiling and fingerprinting strategies will be combined for ensuring a large cover of the metabolome, e.g. UPLC-HRMS, target UPLC-MS/MS, GC-MS, and ICP-MS. Preliminary investigations will be required to evaluate the different approaches to enrich the less abundant metabolites in WAT. Following metabolite assignment, comparative chemometric analyses between visceral, sub-cutaneous adipose tissue and plasma along the time course of the nutritional challenge, should identify a few candidates for a possible link to inflammation. Further studies will then be pursued in cell culture, as a more controlled experimental system.3.Exploration of the mechanistic link between epigenetic variations, metabolite profile and chronic inflammation. The identification of epigenetic marks and of metabolite changes correlating with inflammation onset does not allow to disentangle what is the cause and what is the consequence. Thus, further analyses of the data obtained in aim 1 will be conducted to evaluate the epigenetic profile of genes involved in the production/degradation of the metabolites identified in aim 2. Reciprocally, cells in culture will be treated by the selected metabolites and subsequent epigenetic changes of genes involved in the onset of the inflammation responses will be assessed.The successful execution of this project will strongly expand the knowledge on the complex obesogenic program and will help in defining new therapeutic strategies to prevent, restrict and/or resolve inflammation in the context of obesity. The systematic and multidisciplinary approach of this application, based on molecular and cellular biology, genomics, chemistry, biochemistry and bioinformatics will establish a technical platform for the understanding of the causes of obesity-related inflammation.

Eighteen known HDACs are subdivided into 4 classes, based on their structure. Members of the class I have been shown to influence the differentiation of oligodendrocytes, the myelinating glia of the central nervous system (CNS). My recent studies showed that HDAC1 and HDAC2 (class I HDACs) are essential for the myelination process and the survival of Schwann cells, the myelinating glia of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). These findings provide basic mechanistic understanding of HDAC functions in Schwann cell development, and may have implications for the role of glial cells in the regeneration of the nervous system. With this project, I will study the functions of HDACs expressed and regulated in myelinating glial cells during regeneration after a nerve lesion. Although Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes exert comparable supportive functions towards axons, these two cell types differ in many ways. One of the most striking differences lies in their regenerative properties: Schwann cells can efficiently promote axonal repair, whereas oligodendrocytes do not. Thus, only peripheral nerves can fully regenerate after an injury. This is largely due to the remarkable plasticity of Schwann cells, which can de-differentiate and re-differentiate in case of damage to foster axonal re-growth and restore myelination. The differentiation steps of Schwann cell and oligodendrocyte development are controlled by a large network of transcriptional activators and repressors. Among these factors, some are common and have similar functions in Schwann cell and oligodendrocyte development, but many of them are different or are differentially involved in both cell types. Consistent with this notion, the HDACs regulating differentiation and myelination act through distinct mechanisms in Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes. These differences may be due to different patterns of protein expression and activity in these two cell types. The involvement of epigenetics in the regulation of the differentiation and myelination processes in oligodendrocytes, and more recently in Schwann cells, became an active area of investigation, showing how their transcriptional machinery is regulated by changes in chromatin architecture. However, the role of epigenetic regulators in the regeneration of the nervous system after a nerve injury is mostly unknown. My project will tackle this question and compare the essential functions of HDACs in Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes during neuroregeneration after a lesion.This study comprises two key aims: 1/ Understand the involvement of HDACs in Schwann cells during regeneration, 2/ Determine whether and how HDACs can influence regeneration in the CNS.To reach the first aim of this project, I will identify HDACs that are crucial in Schwann cells for the regeneration program after a lesion of the PNS, and then unravel their functions, their target genes and mechanisms of action, and elucidate how their expression and activity levels are regulated. To reach the second aim, I will identify differences in HDAC regulation, functions and mechanisms of action in Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes that are critical for regeneration after a nerve lesion. Based on these findings, I will design and test novel strategies for reprogramming oligodendrocytes to improve CNS regeneration. To conduct these studies, I will use cutting-edge technologies, including temporally controlled Schwann cell-specific gene ablation in mice, in vivo injection of viral vectors, local delivery of DNA in the spinal cord using osmotic pumps, microfluidic chambers for in vitro model of nerve lesion, microarray analyses for gene expression, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) for identification of HDAC individual target genes.With this work, I expect to identify new regulatory mechanisms that help in designing new therapeutic strategies to promote the recovery of the nervous system from disease and injury.

Consistent with this concept, we recently demonstrated that apparently healthy ART children display marked generalized vascular dysfunction that may predispose them to premature cardiovascular morbidity and mortality later in life. Owing to the difficulty of studying underlying mechanisms in healthy children, we developed a mouse model of ART. We found that ART induces vascular dysfunction in mice that appears to be related to altered epigenetic regulation of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis. There is convincing evidence that defective NO synthesis represents a link between cardiovascular disease and insulin resistance. Consistent with this concept, eNOS null mice are insulin resistant and eNOS heterozygous mice develop exaggerated insulin resistance when challenged with a metabolic stress (high-fat diet). Taken together, these data suggest that ART may induce not only vascular but also metabolic alterations. The major aim of this proposal is therefore to test the hypothesis that in addition to vascular dysfunction ART also induces insulin resistance in mice and to test for underlying mechanisms. To test this hypothesis, we will compare glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in ART and control mice fed either normal chow or a high-fat diet during 8 wks. We expect that (similarly to what we observed in eNOS heterozygous mice) glucose homeostasis will be normal in ART mice fed with normal chow, but that high-fat diet will induce exaggerated insulin resistance in ART compared to control mice. In a next step, we will start to test for the potential role of epigenetic mechanisms in causing insulin resistance in ART mice. ART-induced alterations of histone acetylation and/or DNA methylation may induce stable changes in the expression of genes that are important for the regulation of cardiovascular and glucose homeostasis. Preliminary data from our group suggest that ART-induced vascular dysfunction is associated with altered methylation of imprinted genes and the promoter of the eNOS gene. Epigenetic changes can be reversed by histone deacetylase inhibitors and DNA methylation inhibitors. We will therefore test whether insulin resistance in ART mice is associated with impaired epigenetic regulation of the eNOS gene expression in vascular and skeletal muscle tissue and examine whether administration of an inhibitor of DNA methylation or of a histone deacetylase inhibitor normalizes DNA methylation of the eNOS gene promoter and insulin sensitivity in ART mice. ART-induced epigenetic alterations (and metabolic and vascular dysfunction) may be transmitted to the next generation. We will test for this possibility by assessing glucose homeostasis in offspring of male ART mice mated with normal females. To test for epigenetic mechanism in this setting we will examine whether administration of epigenetic drugs to ART mice before mating prevents the transmission of this problem to the next generation. In a final step, we will then start to test specific interventions during the ART procedure in order to prevent the induction of metabolic dysfunction in the offspring. A possible cause of ART-induced epigenetic alterations may be that the embryos are fertilized and maintained in culture media for ~96 hours before transfer to the uterus. We will, therefore, examine whether a shortening of this phase prevents long-term metabolic consequences of ART. Alternatively, melatonin has favorable effects on oocyte maturation, improves the success rate of in vitro fertilization, and, may be involved in epigenetic regulation. In a second step, we will, therefore, study the effects of the addition of melatonin to the ART culture media on insulin sensitivity and eNOS promoter methylation in ART mice. The number of children born after ART is rapidly increasing and these children represent a significant proportion of the population. The demonstration of vascular and metabolic dysfunction and its underlying mechanisms in ART children will be of utmost clinical importance, since these children may be at risk for premature cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The proposed research combines studies in experimental animals in vivo and in vitro with molecular biology techniques to provide insight into the extent and underlying mechanisms of metabolic dysfunction in offspring of ART. These studies are expected to provide insight into the potential role of epigenetic mechanisms in this setting. They are also expected to provide new tools for the prevention of vascular and metabolic dysfunction in future children generated by this technique and help to prevent premature cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the present generation of offspring of ART.

Cichlid fishes are one of the most diverse and species-rich vertebrate families and are suitable model organisms to analyze both the genetic and epigenetic basis of evolution. It is not well understood how changes in transcriptional regulation are used to drive the evolution of phenotypically diverse traits such as body pigmentation, jaw structure and brain morphology.By performing ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing) for both histone modifications and modifiers in selected tissues of six different cichlid species I aim to screen in an unbiased manner for regulatory elements influencing the expression of tissue- and species- specific phenotypic traits.I intend to use novel genome engineering approaches including e.g. TALENs (transcription activator- like effector nucleases) to modify the activity of selected regulatory elements in vivo. This offers for the first time the possibility to a) investigate the activity of regulatory elements, b) by deletion or modification, interfere with their function, and c) by insertion of regulatory elements of other species genetically engineer new traits, thereby understanding their role in speciation.

Interestingly, mood disorders have a high comorbidity rate with eating disorders and obesity. Further, recent work has demonstrated that hormones that regulate feeding also influence mood. However, we know little about the underlying mechanisms in the brain that coordinate feeding and anxiety behaviors. Feeding behavior emerges during the transition from nursing to foraging for solid food at weaning. A foraging animal must integrate external and internal cues to regulate the delicate balance between rewarding caloric intake and predation risk, thereby coordinating feeding behavior and anxiety behaviors. The serotonergic system is a primary regulator of anxiety and feeding and genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that regulate the function of the serotonin system to coordinate feeding and anxiety behaviors are of major biological and biomedical interest. Genomic imprinting is a heritable form of epigenetic gene regulation that results in preferential expression of the maternally versus the paternally inherited allele for select genes in the genome. Using a new approach based on next generation sequencing, the Gregg Lab has identified hundreds of novel imprinted genes expressed in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) of the serotonin system. Interestingly, imprinted genes are thought to have evolved due to a parental conflict over the consumption of maternal resources by offspring. The conflict over maternal resource consumption is proposed to be maximal during weaning when offspring benefit, but mothers suffer from a prolonged nursing period. These provocative findings have lead me to propose the hypothesis that imprinted genes regulate the development and function of serotonergic neurons in the DRN and modulate the emergence of adult feeding and anxiety-related behaviors during the nursing to foraging transition at weaning. To begin to test this hypothesis I will undertake the following three aims. First, I will characterize changes to feeding and anxiety-related behaviors associated with the nursing to foraging transition in juvenile mice using a novel foraging behavior task, which will allow me to measure the emergence of feeding, exploratory behavior and risk-reward decision-making. Additionally, I will characterize developmental changes to behavior and neuronal activity in response to the internal hormonal hunger cue ghrelin. Second, I will test the hypothesis that significant changes to imprinted gene expression occur in the DRN during the weaning period. Here, I will perform a large scale RNA-Seq study to uncover potential changes to imprinted gene expression in the DRN prior to and after weaning. Third, I will undertake functional studies using transgenic mice and the foraging behavior task to determine if maternally and paternally expressed imprinted genes in the DRN differentially regulate the developmental transition from nursing to foraging. This innovative study is anticipated to uncover novel genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that coordinate the development of feeding and anxiety behaviors during early life in preparation for independent foraging. By focusing on imprinted genes, complex parental influences over the risk for developing obesity, eating disorders and anxiety-related disorders may be revealed.

We demonstrated that nicotine increases intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in epithelial alveolar cells through NOX1, a NAPDH oxidase isoform generating ROS. The mechanism of these intracellular effects is mediated by a cross-talk between NOX1 and mitochondria. Moreover, our in vivo preliminary results show that pups born from pregnant mice exposed to nicotine exhibit lung morphological alterations that differ from those observed in rats, widely used as animal models for such studies. Genetically deficient mice represent a valuable tool to study the molecular mechanisms of lung biology. In addition, alveolarization step occurs completely after birth in mice. In this project, we want to:1) Study the role of oxidative stress during late stage lung development in response to maternal exposure to nicotine in mice. As we demonstrated a NOX1-dependent nicotine effect in vitro, we will study the contribution of this enzyme and oxidative stress to lung development during nicotine exposure. The role of oxidative stress in normal lung development will also be investigated by analyzing the progeny of NOX1-/- mice. We will characterize the lung morphological alterations by using stereological techniques as well as biochemical analysis of the molecular redox pathways. 2) Compare maternal exposure to CS with nicotine. Among the multitude of toxic compounds contained in CS, ROS are very abundant. It is therefore likely that most of the deleterious effect of CS during pregnancy is not only due to nicotine. The separate analysis of the contribution of nicotine to cigarette smoke-induced oxidative stress will be of great interest. Indeed, although far more complex, the gestational CS smoke model in vivo is much closer to “real life”. CS-induced oxidative stress can directly damage lung tissue of the pups or can change the pattern of gene expression or even the epigenome. To test this hypothesis, we will measure markers of oxidative stress in lung tissues and in pregnant mouse blood as well as analyze the pups’ lung transcriptomic and epigenetic modulations induced by CS exposure, in comparison with the sole effect of nicotine. Pups derived from NOX1-/- mothers will allow us to determine the part of oxidative stress produced by CS or nicotine-exposed mothers. We will confirm our in vivo findings by investigating the possible intracellular mechanisms on lung epithelial cells in vitro, in which we observed a much higher level of intracellular cell death with CS compared to the sole nicotine administration, probably related to different toxic compounds and ROS present in CS. The in vitro pathways of nicotine-induced effects have already been investigated and published.These strategies will help us to define the precise role of nicotine and CS-induced oxidative stress in lung development and to assess in parallel the contribution of oxidative stress to normal lung development. The comparison between nicotine and CS exposure will provide a better understanding on additional compound effects and their relative developmental toxicity. Moreover, it will help to understand the risks for nicotine-replacement therapies and, finally, to find biological markers reflecting lung damage during pregnancy.

The impact of obesity on cancer is a major public health concern because of the large and growing pandemic proportion of obesity. In addition obesity is a negative prognostic factor with impact on cancer treatments and outcome. For the future it will be of the utmost importance to identify cancer treatments specifically tailored for overweight and obese patients. In spite of the clinical relevance, the mechanism by which obesity promotes cancer initiation and progression remains largely elusive. Although cancer initiation and progression requires the activation of tumor promoting genes (oncogenes) and the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes through genetic and epigenetic events, additional factors within the host provide an important and some times essential contribution to tumorigenesis. Bone marrow-derived inflammatory cells newly recruited at the tumor site and resident leukocytes are instrumental to inflammatory events contributing to tumor initiation and progression. The formation of a tumor-associated vasculature, a process also know as tumor angiogenesis, facilitates primary tumor growth and metastasis formation. In this project three established investigators, Pr C. Rüegg, Dr. G. Solinas and Pr V. Djonov with related but complementary research interests and expertise are joining forces to investigate host-dependent mechanisms of obesity-mediated tumor initiation and promotion. PI3K-Akt is a critical signaling node in mechanisms modulating metabolism, obesity, inflammation, angiogenesis and cancer relevant to obesity-mediated tumor promotion. In this project we will generate and use mice lacking three different isozymes of PI3K (beta, gamma, delta) in hematopoietic/inflammatory and endothelial cells, to test the role of these PI3K isozymes in obesity mediated promotion of hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer progression and metastasis, and intussusceptive angiogenesis. The specific subprojects are:1) Investigating the role of PI3K signaling in obesity-mediated promotion of hepatocellular carcinoma (Solinas)2) Role of class-1 PI3K signaling within hematopoietic and endothelial cells in obesity-mediated breast cancer progression (Rüegg)2) Intussusceptive angiogenesis - an alternative way of blood vessel formation in obesity driven tumor initiation and progression (Djonov)We envisage that results obtained in this project will have important implications toward a better understanding of the mechanisms of cancer initiation and progression, which may be fundamental to better tumor prevention or cancer treatment for overweight and obese individuals.

Long-term survival can currently be achieved in only ~60% of patients despite of intense multimodal treatment protocols; a disappointing figure stagnating since more than three decades. A partial explanation for treatment failure might lie in the number and kind of mutations in osteosarcoma genomes that vary significantly between individual tumours and of which only few are targetable. Despite the genetic complexity, we have recently shown that >90% of osteosarcomas display mutation patterns similar to those seen in BRCA deficient breast and ovarian cancers (so-called BRCAness) rendering them likely susceptible to PARP inhibitor treatment.Since our findings captured BRCAness only in pre-therapeutic biopsies so far, the proposed project aims to follow its evolution over time using sequentially obtained material from 16 patients, including samples from the initial biopsy, the resection specimen as well as from recurrent disease. We shall integrate exome, genome and RNA sequencing supplemented by copy number and methylation analyses to explore the clonal diversity and hierarchy, thus building an evolutionary history of each tumour. Additionally, we shall assess the degree of BRCAness and therefore the likelihood of specific tumour cell populations to respond to PARP inhibition at different stages of the disease. An additional cohort of >220 osteosarcoma samples, all derived from an international osteosarcoma treatment trial (EURAMOS1), and with complete clinico-pathological data, is available for validation of the main findings from cohort 1 and further (epi-)genetic studies. Together with collaborators from other countries that have also collected samples of EURAMOS1 patients, we aim to assemble the yet largest series of osteosarcomas and attempt to correlate (epi-)genetic findings with clinico-pathological data. Specifically, we shall validate the prevalence of BRCAness and search for complementary / alternative vulnerabilites.We believe that only the complete integration of genomic and epigenomic data may identify subtle functional signatures of mutational processes with prognostic or even therapeutic impact. Hence the proposed project will provide a deeper understanding of osteosarcoma evolution in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, we will determine whether a BRCA-like phenotype is required for recurrence and/or metastatic progression and whether new signatures can be identified by integrating epigenetic data in a large cohort of clinically well characterized osteosarcomas.

In the damaged heart, loss of function is essentially due to cardiomyocyte death and associated cardiac remodeling. Therefore, identifying relevant molecular mechanisms controlling cardiomyocyte survival under these pathological conditions could be exploited to prevent cardiac dysfunction. Intracellular transduction events controlling cardiomyocyte function are regulated by scaffolding and anchoring proteins, which ensure coordination of signals in space and time. In this respect, A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) have been shown to tether PKA and other signaling enzymes to orchestrate and synchronize cellular processes associated with cardiac remodeling.We now provide evidence that AKAPs regulate epigenetic and transcriptional processes that favor heart protection against MI-associated remodeling and the cardiotoxic effects of doxorubicin-based anti-cancer therapies. In particular, our current results indicate that, inside the nucleus of cardiomyocytes, AKAP2 coordinates a chromatin-remodeling complex that might promote the transcriptional activation of specific sets of genes, including the vascular endothelial growth factor a (VEGFa) and Bcl2, to support angiogenesis and cardiomyocyte survival in infarcted hearts. On the other hand, we can show that AKAP-Lbc assembles a newly identified signaling complex that coordinates Akt1-dependent pro-survival pathways, which might icantly reduce doxorubicin-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis.Based on these findings, this grant proposal is requested to support a project in basic research directed at elucidating the role of AKAP2 and AKAP-Lbc as potential coordinators of survival responses in cardiomyocytes both in vitro and in vivo. Knowing that MI and doxorubicin-based anti-cancer therapies represent major risk factors for developing heart failure, investigating the molecular mechanisms whereby AKAPs antagonize cardiomyocyte death and remodeling events induced by these cardiac insults will contribute to identify novel approaches to prevent cardiac dysfunction. The proposed study will focus on two main projects.Project 1: To determine the role of the AKAP2/SWI-SNF chromatin remodeling complex in protection against myocardial infarction-associated remodeling.This will be accomplished by characterizing the molecular organization of the nuclear complex formed by AKAP2 and the ATP-dependent SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, and by defining the epigenetic mechanisms whereby this signaling unit controls Bcl2 and VEGFa transcription. Finally, we will take advantage of an inducible cardiac-specific AKAP2 knockout mouse model to investigate whether AKAP2 confers protection against post-MI cardiac remodeling by favoring angiogenesis and by inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Project 2: To determine the role of the AKAP-Lbc/Akt1 complex in protection against doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity.This will be accomplished by characterizing the molecular organization of the AKAP-Lbc/Akt1 complex and by determining how AKAP-Lbc mediates the activation of Akt1. We will next investigate whether the AKAP-Lbc/Akt1 complex regulates anti-apoptotic pathways in isolated cardiomyocytes. Finally, we will take advantage of mouse models displaying cardiac specific overexpression or knockout of AKAP-Lbc, to investigate whether this anchoring protein promotes protection against doxorubicin-induced myocardial toxicity.

Maternal malnutrition in pregnancy is associated with offspring growth restriction and increased risk of the offspring developing metabolic disease in adulthood. In mice, maternal malnutrition causes a lifelong change in the epigenetic state of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and altered transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). These epigenetic changes were restricted to a subset (40-60%) of the hundreds of rDNA copies within the genome of an individual. Further analysis suggests that this epigenetic effect alters which genetically distinct variants of rRNA are expressed. Despite a striking quantitative correlation between growth restriction and rDNA epigenetic silencing, a mechanistic link between this epigenetic programming and phenotype is yet to be established. I propose to develop a tractable mammalian cell model to address what the downstream consequences of perturbing rRNA production are for ribosome composition. First, I will generate cell lines that recapitulate natural genetic variation at rDNA. These will be modified to inducibly over-express an epigenetic modifier that specifically targets rDNA. After optimisation of this system I will determine how modifying rDNA epigenetics influences the rRNA composition of ribosomes. Variation in the rRNA composition of ribosomes alters protein translation fidelity in a range of non-mammalian model organisms. The model proposed here will be used to address the hypothesis that epigenetic programming of rDNA, via altering ribosome composition, has consequences for ribosome function thereby modifying fidelity or other aspects of protein translation. This novel mechanism of regulating genomic output may account for the mechanism by which compromised fetal development increases adult metabolic disease risk.

In the neural lineage, perturbations to this system are causal in both congenital and acquired brain pathologies, yet how polycomb proteins regulate transcriptional programmes during normal neurodevelopment remains poorly understood. I aim to elucidate how polycomb regulates neurodevelopment by determining how cell-type-specific protein factors alter the targeting and function of polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). To address this I will combine state-of-the-art molecular approaches and advanced computational analysis to: 1). Determine the protein composition of PRC1 complexes in in vitro differentiated and ex vivo cultured neural progenitor cells (NPCs). 2) Apply auxin-induced degradation (AID) to reversibly deplete PRC1 components in mESCs and determine the impact of depletion on gene repression and the capacity to differentiate ESCs into NPCs. 3). Determine if neurodevelopment is disrupted, both in vitro and in vivo, in separation of function mutants (Ring1b I53A) in which the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity but not the structural function of RING1B is abolished. 4). Identify and validate NPC-specific PRC1 targeting factors using a combination of quantitative proteomic analysis of PRC bound chromatin and AID. 5). Determine the logic of PRC1 recruitment in NPCs by targeting prospective chromatin-recruitment factors with synthetic tools (TALs) in isolation or in combination with chromatin modifiers. Though these objectives I will determine not only the molecular basis of neuropathologies associated with PRC dysfunction but also provide insight into how cell-type-specific proteins adapt or target epigenetic systems to regulate gene expression.

1108	Dr Michelle Percharde	MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences	None	2018-09-01	2021-03-31	Chromatin and Development	Our long-term goal is to understand the transcriptional and epigenetic events that underlie the process of mammalian development. In particular, we focus on the parts of the genome made up of transposable elements (TEs): elements known to be historically or currently mobile within our DNA. Significantly less is known about TEs compared to single copy protein-coding genes despite their high abundance in the human genome. This includes during mammalian development, where the role of relaxed TE repression and increased TE expression is not understood. Our previous work has revealed that the TE, LINE1 plays essential functions in controlling gene regulatory networks in the earliest stages of pre-implantation development (Percharde et al., 2018). This is interestingly independent of retrotransposition activity, and distinct from somatic cells, where increased LINE1 expression has been associated with cancer, inflammation, or senescence. These findings highlight how much is still to be learned about TE function in multiple contexts. Our objectives are firstly to investigate how TE expression and regulation has been co-opted for essential processes in mouse and human developmental contexts. Second, we aim to compare and contrast TE regulation in developmental versus disease states to understand how TE mis-regulation occurs and how this contributes to disease. We use a combination of mouse and human somatic and embryonic stem cell lines together with mouse embryo models to explore mechanisms regulating TE expression. Our experimental approach combines both candidate and genome-wide techniques, bioinformatics and CRISPR technology to uncover new TE regulators as well as to directly manipulate TE expression. Overall, we aim to shed light on how TE expression contributes to normal embryo development and uncover mechanisms to explain how and why these elements may contribute to disease.

Epigenetic changes seem to have a crucial role in pathways leading from early-life nutrition to metabolic health across the life course. NutriPROGRAM will study key maternal and infant nutrition-related exposures in relation to DNA methylation in mothers and offspring at different ages, and metabolic health outcomes across the life course. It will involve: (1) integrating sets of early-life nutritional factors in mothers and infants; (2) observational and intervention studies across the life course on metabolic outcomes including longitudinal growth and fat development, advanced imaging for body fat, metabolomic profiles and clinical outcomes; (3) cause-and-effect relationships of DNA methylation in the associations of nutrition-related factors and metabolic outcomes across the life course, by advanced causal inference approaches; (4) modification of DNA methylation changes by nutrition, lifestyle, physical activity and microbiota; (5) functional consequences of differences in DNA methylation using RNA expression and tissue specific approaches; and (6) translation into preventive or population-health strategies. NutriPROGRAM will capitalize on rich, existing and complementary nutritional, metabolic and epigenetic datasets from observational and intervention studies in pregnancy, childhood and adulthood, together covering the full life course. It will use knowledge and data infrastructures from different collaborative consortia including the Horizon2020 DynaHEALTH and LifeCycle Projects, the ERA-HDHL ALPHABET project, and the Pregnancy and Childhood Epigenetics (PACE) Consortium. Eventually, NutriPROGRAM will develop a sustainable, translational, international collaboration for current and future studies on nutrition and epigenetics and their role in sustaining good health throughout the lifecourse.

1110	Dr. Zsuzsanna MÉRAI	Austrian Academy of Sciences	None	2019-02-01	2023-01-31	A NOVEL MODEL TO STUDY LIGHT-REGULATED SEED GERMINATION	Besides in photosynthesis, light has an important role for plant development, including seed germination. Seeds are classified by photoblastism into three categories based on their response to white light during germination: (i) Positive photoblastic seeds require light to germinate; (ii) light-insensitive seeds germinate with or without light; (iii) negative photoblastic seed germination is inhibited by light. Research on the positive photoblastic seeds of lettuce or Arabidopsis has contributed the majority of knowledge about the molecular regulation of light-dependent germination, while little is known about the two other classes. We recently discovered a remarkable natural variation of photoblastism in Aethionema arabicum (Brassicaceae). Seeds of one A. arabicum accessions from Cyprus (CYP) are negatively photoblastic, while another ecotype from Turkey (TUR) is insensitive to light. The germination of CYP seeds is not just temporarily inhibited by light, but extended exposure induces a secondary seed dormancy that suppresses germination for a long period even after seeds are transferred back to darkness. We aim to utilize the genetic and genomic resources available for A. arabicum and establish it as a model plant to study the molecular mechanism of light-inhibited and light-insensitive germination. The hypotheses of this proposal are (i) Natural variation of photoblastic responses between the accessions has a genetic basis and represents an adaptive trait. (ii) Light-insensitive and negative photoblastic responses in genetically similar accessions of A. arabicum, compared with positively photoblastic Arabidopsis, provide an opportunity to understand light regulation of germination. (iii) The key components of light signalling pathways governing germination are largely the same in Arabidopsis and Aethionema, while the responses diverge in extent and direction. (iv) Light-induced secondary seed dormancy in accession CYP is mediated and stabilized by epigenetic changes. Our preliminary work includes physiological and transcriptional characterization of seed germination in both A. arabicum accessions. In this project, we plan to investigate photobiological, genomic, phylogenetic and epigenetic aspects to understand light-regulated germination inhibition and seed dormancy and its occurrence in the Aethionemeae genus as adaptation to local environment. The application proposes pioneering research on a yet under-investigated effect of light on seed germination, an essential part of plant development. Beside of the potential to identify novel key regulators, analysis of epigenetic parameters before, during and after secondary dormancy will offer valuable information for seed biology also in other plants and in other contexts. The applicant (Zsuzsanna Mérai) is a senior post-doc with background in plant development, photobiology and epigenetic research, in the laboratory of Ortrun Mittelsten Scheid at the Gregor Mendel Institute of Molecular Plant Biology (Vienna, Austria).

Little is known, however, how persistent and heritable these alterations can be, after the pollution exposure has ceased. Moreover, implications of epigenetic control of gene involved in metal detoxification have not been clarified yet. Therefore, the aim of the proposed study is to determine the consequences of heavy metal pollution on genome wide and gene specific DNA methylation patterns and expression response of main metal detoxifying gene (metalothionein (MT)) in the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris, as well as to define the persistence and heritability of metal induced epigenetic alterations. Earthworms will be chronically exposed to a low dose of cadmium (Cd) and their responses will be assessed by monitoring the expression of MT gene. The epigenetic regulation of MT gene will be assessed by methylation sensitive – high resolution melting (MS-HRM). Genome wide DNA methylation status will be assessed by next generation bisulfite-converted restriction site associated DNA sequencing (bsRADseq). Additionally, genes involved DNA methylation and demethylation (DNMT1, DNMT2, DNMT3, TET) will be defined and quantified to further explain the occurrence of DNA methylation alterations. The above mentioned analyses will be performed in earthworms after Cd exposure and after a period of recovery, as well as in their F1 and F2 progeny. Furthermore, development of tolerance mechanisms in earthworms reared in low Cd dose polluted soil as well as in their progeny will be tested upon high Cd dose exposure and assessed by the above mentioned methods. The results of this study will generate novel information on epigenetic alterations, and their persistence and heritability in metal polluted environments. Moreover, the project will further our understanding on the mechanisms of metal detoxification and development of metal tolerance mechanisms in earthworms. The main researches responsible for the project will be the applicant Dr. Maja Šrut, University of Zagreb, Croatia and the co-applicant Ass.prof. Martina Höckner, University of Innsbruck, Austria.

1112	Dr Natalie Shenker	Imperial College London	Surgery and Cancer	2019-05-01	2023-04-30	Maximising the public health impact of a human milk bank	Human milk is hugely complex, containing thousands of factors that guide development, protect babies from infections, and train their immune system to recognise harms. Breastfeeding also gives major health benefits to mothers, but these are largely unknown and unexplained. Furthermore, human milk banks, which provide screened donated breast milk to sick infants when a mother's milk supply is insufficient, have been restricted in recent decades, meaning donor milk is now rationed to only the most preterm babies. The UK has no dedicated centre of research into human milk, and few centres in the world focus on the maternal health impact of breastfeeding. Having founded the first independent non-profit human milk in the UK 2 years ago, I have laid the groundwork to launch an innovative programme of three research projects, each of which will lay the foundations for a larger body of impactful research and clinical advances. The three projects are summarised: 1: Genetic mutations are known to cause breast cancer (e.g. BRCA1 mutations), but much less is known about the epigenetic risk. Epigenetics describes the modifications to DNA that regulate how much of the DNA is turned into proteins. Epigenetic patterns are tissue-specific, so patterns detected in breast cells are different to other tissues such as blood. Previous research, including our own work, has identified epigenetic patterns of breast cancer risk in the DNA of blood DNA. We have found evidence that different cancer risk factors, such as smoking, alcohol and BMI, influence these patterns. However, it is difficult to extrapolate these findings to breast tissue. Breast milk contains a large number of cells from the lining of the breast ducts that are the same cell type that may develop breast cancer. Many of the molecular changes that cause breast cancer may occur long before the cancer has developed and may be detectable in these cells. First, I will recruit more subjects into our research cohort to reach a minimum of 300 subjects. We will assess known epigenetic markers of risk including aging, smoking, alcohol and BMI. This project will provide evidence of early changes in normal breast cells and provide important biological insights into how these increase risk. Finally, this work will provide the evidence needed to create a large study of milk from 20,000 women to develop new cancer screening tests. 2: The World Health Organisation recommends children are breastfed for at least 2 years, but only tiny amounts of data exists on the composition of human milk beyond 6 months. We will recruit 45 mothers to give samples of milk every 3 months over at least 2 years, and profile each sample for the 1000s of fatty acids to understand how milk composition changes, if at all. This information will guide milk donor recruitment, address the value of breastfeeding beyond 6 months, and inform future studies of targeting donor milk for babies with specific nutritional needs. 3: Babies born just a few weeks prematurely, so-called late preterm babies, have a higher risk of death and ill health than full-term babies. They are often a good weight and mostly do not need help with breathing, but still have subtle problems. One of these problems is a lower chance of establishing breastfeeding. Extremely premature babies who receive only mother's milk or donor milk do better in both the short- and long term compared to those who receive formula. Mothers whose babies receive donor milk see it as a 'bridge' to expressing or breastfeeding. We will recruit 120 babies and mothers born late preterm and randomise them to receive donor milk compared to formula with lactation support to assess whether this helps mothers to establish breastfeeding. The three questions addressed in this Fellowship aim to help improve the UK's breastfeeding rates, which have been among the worst in the world for more than two decades. This Fellowship presents a unique opportunity to drive change.	Medical Research Council	Fellowship	954821.0	GBP
1113	Dr Markus Schober	New York University	None	2019-01-01	2021-12-31	Defining NRF2-independent ROS management as bottleneck to tumor initiation	Cancer is generally viewed as a genetic disease, which develops when cells acquire mutations in proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors. These mutations are thought to progressively derail tissue homeostasis, allowing for an expansion of tumorigenic clones with unlimited proliferative potential that fuels long-term tumor growth. Surprisingly, recent mutational analyses of physiologically normal skins unveiled a mutational spectrum and burden that is similar to what had been reported for squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). Additionally, intravital imaging revealed that skin epithelial progenitor cells (EPCs) with oncogenic mutations persist only transiently and are primarily outcompeted by normal EPCs. These observations, along with stereotypic transcriptional and metabolic changes, which distinguish tumor propagating SCC cells (TPCs) from normal EPCs, suggest that epigenetic adaptation is critical for tumor initiation and persistent expansion. Still, the mechanisms facilitating this epigenetic and metabolic rewiring are largely unknown. Here, we will test the hypothesis that de novo Paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 1 (PITX1) expression facilitates the epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of KrasG12Dmutant EPC into TPCs. PITX1 dependent changes in chromatin accessibility will enhance self-renewal and increase cell survival by reducing Ras generated reactive oxygen species (ROS). Specifically, we will (1.) determine how PITX1 cooperates with KrasG12Das they reprogram the transposase accessible open chromatin of homeostatic EPCs into the TPC specific epigenetic landscape; (2.) measure how these changes in chromatin accessibility influence ROS management; and (3.) determine if PITX1 dependent antioxidant production is a rate limiting step for tumor initiation. The results of our proposed research are expected to illuminate how oncogenic stress co-operates with sequence specific transcription factors to epigenetically rewire a homeostatic state into a tumorigenic epigenome, which allows TPCs to meet the metabolic demands required for tumor expansion. Once identified, these mechanisms could improve the early diagnosis and prevention of this exceedingly common and deadly human cancer.	Worldwide Cancer Research	Project Grant	199782.0	GBP

Aversive memories of such an event are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis and symptomatology of the disorder. We have previously shown that glucocorticoids play a critical role in regulating aversive memories with potentially important implications for PTSD. Furthermore, we have shown that an epigenetic modification of the glucocorticoid receptor gene promoter is linked to aversive memories and PTSD risk in survivors of the Rwandan genocide. In the current application we propose to extend our previous work by studying epigenetic modifications in genes related to glucocorticoid signalling using gene-set based methods on whole-genome methylation data in survivors of the Rwandan genocide. In addition, we will have the possibility to further explore the findings, in a healthy population with existing genome-wide methylation data regarding aversive memory processing and its underlying neural correlates. The findings of the proposed study will add to the understanding of the mechanisms related to increased PTSD risk after traumatic events.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div.

The general goal of this research plan is to examine key aspects of transcriptional regulation during circuit assembly. To accomplish this goal, we will focus on the epigenetic and transcriptional control of directional migration and connectivity patterns of selected subsets of precerebellar neurons. In particular, we will study the development of the pontine nuclei, which receive cortical input and provide main mossy fiber output to cerebellum, as a first step to unravel the complex logics of cortico-ponto-cerebellar connectivity. The key hypothesis addressed in this proposal is that rostrocaudal origin and Hox gene transcriptional programs in precerebellar neuron subsets allow to allocate neuronal subsets at specific positions within the mature nuclei, and, in turn, provide neurons with specific transcriptional codes for the specificity of input-output synaptic partner choice (i.e. selective attraction/repulsion of afferent input from distinct cortical areas and output to specific lobes of the cerebellum). The project will make use of a wide range of ad hoc genetic tools in the mouse and will utilise a combination of molecular, cellular and anatomical approaches. We will mechanistically address the impact of environmental signalling, namely retinoic acid secreted from the meninges overlying pontine neurons, on the epigenetic and transcriptional regulation at the promoter of a key transcription factor, Hoxa5, as a novel mechanism to generate a temporally and spatially restricted neuronal subpopulation of precerebellar neurons. Moreover, we will examine the relationship between Hox-expressing pontine neuron subsets, their final nuclear position, and the topography of their afferent/efferent (i.e. cortico-ponto) connectivity pathways. A specific focus will be on the role of Hox PG5 genes in providing unique cortical afferent and cerebellar efferent projection patterns to precerebellar neuron subsets. In the long-term, such studies are expected to further our understanding of the molecular mechanims involved in transforming cortical into cerebellar sensorymotor maps.

SUMMARYThe recent development of tiling arrays and RNA deep sequencing has revealed that all genomes, from yeast to man, are transcribed much more extensively than assumed producing an extraordinary amount of non-coding RNA (ncRNA). In yeast, a large fraction of intergenic regions are transcribed as cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) rapidly degraded by the nuclear exosome. In addition, many genes encode anti-sense transcripts. The potential role of these ncRNAs in genome regulation is an active area of investigation. Our recent studies on the S. cerevisiae PHO84 gene provide new elements as to how antisense RNAs participate in transcription regulation. We found that loss of the exosome component Rrp6 results in PHO84 antisense RNA stabilization and repression of PHO84 sense transcription through the recruitment of the histone deacetylase complex Hda1/2/3. Our more recent data show that PHO84 anti-sense transcripts also induce TGS in trans, in a mechanism independent of Hda1. Thus, transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) in cis and trans operate through distinct pathways. One aim of this proposal is to identify additional components involved in cis- and trans-silencing using genetic and biochemical approaches to purify antisense RNA bound factors. Another aim is to understand how antisense RNA production is regulated, how this ncRNA is processed and metabolized and in which form it is active in silencing. A third objective is to test the generality of our model using high density tiling arrays to identify other genes down-regulated in response to antisense accumulation, and define whether repression depends on Hda1 or alternate silencing factors. Early steps of mRNA biogenesis and export through nuclear pore complexes (NPC) are functionally linked processes. RNA polymerase II plays a central role in the coordination of these events by recruiting processing and export factors to nascent mRNAs. Notably, a number of yeast genes relocate to the nuclear periphery upon activation, and evidence suggests that the NPC environment contributes to optimal gene expression. Our recent studies point to the importance of post-translational modifications by ubiquitin or SUMO in controlling the dynamic association/dissociation of macromolecular assemblies along the export pathway or in regulating transcription at the pore. Yeast mRNA export is mediated by the export receptor Mex67 and Yra1/REF is described as an adaptor for Mex67 on mRNA. Our recent studies identify the polyA binding protein Nab2 as a new adaptor for Mex67 and indicate that Yra1 acts as a co-factor promoting this interaction. Furthermore, we found that ubiquitination of Yra1 by the Tom1 E3 ligase promotes its dissociation from the Nab2-Mex67 complex while non-ubiquitinated Yra1 mutants are retained on nuclear mRNPs resulting in mRNA export defects. These and additional observations indicate that ubiquitin-induced dissociation of the non-shuttling adaptor Yra1 occurs at the pore acting as a license for export. As lack of Yra1 ubiquitination affects only a fraction of cells, one aim is to investigate whether this mechanism may be preferentially required at a specific stage of the cell cycle. Yra1 appears to be modified by additional ligases and both Nab2 and Mex67 are ubiquitinated. Another aim is to investigate the role of these modifications in regulating early co-transcriptional events down to export through nuclear pores. Perinuclear Mlp proteins are involved in mRNA surveillance by retaining improperly formed mRNPs at the nuclear periphery. Our former studies showed that loss of Mlps rescues the defects in mRNA synthesis and export induced by a yra1 mutation, suggesting that Mlps also contribute to transcription regulation, and more recent work established a link between Mlps and the transcriptional co-repressors Tup1 and Ssn6. Notably, both Tup1 and Ssn6 are sumoylated and Mlp proteins anchor the major SUMO isopeptidase Ulp1 to the nuclear periphery, suggesting that Ulp1 may mediate the effects of Mlps on gene expression. Our preliminary data on the GAL1 gene suggest that Mlps and Ulp1 positively affect transcription by regulating the sumoylation state of transcription repressors such as Tup1 when genes reposition to the nuclear periphery. Our aim is to confirm these data, to find additional Ulp1 targets and to explore whether these mechanisms extend to other inducible genes relocating to the pore upon activation. The proposed work should provide novel insights into the role of post-translational modification in mRNP dynamics and surveillance as well as bring new molecular hints as to how nuclear architecture influences gene expression. Furthermore, unravelling the mechanism of PHO84 antisense-mediated gene silencing and extending these studies to the whole genome should define whether antisense stabilization is a more widely used mechanism for targeting histone deacetylation to specific regions, thus contributing to gene expression plasticity and reprogramming during adaptation or differentiation.

These ‘early-onset psychoses’ (EOP) are generally considered to have an even poorer prognosis than ‘adult-onset psychoses’ (AOP) that have repeatedly been shown to cause enormous disability and costs. Currently, an early detection of and intervention in persons with first signs of emerging psychosis is regarded a promising strategy to reduce the burden of this disease. To this aim, two complementary sets of at-risk criteria have been developed on mainly adult samples: (1) ‘ultra high risk’ criteria (UHR) including attenuated and brief limited intermittent psychotic symptoms and a combination of a genetic risk factor and a recent significant functional decline and (2) the basic symptom criteria (BS) ‘cognitive-perceptive basic symptoms’ and ‘cognitive disturbances’. To date, prevention research in psychosis has mainly been carried out in adult or mixed-age help-seeking at-risk samples, i.e., including a small fraction of mainly older adolescents. And despite some indications that at-risk criteria perform differently in adolescent samples - not least due to developmental aspects, no study has hitherto systematically examined the clinical validity and predictive value of at-risk criteria or of the currently discussed additional neuropsychological predictors of psychosis in child and adolescent (CAD) samples.Working hypothesis and specific aims: The primary aim is to examine the conversion rate to frank psychosis in an at-risk CAD sample (AtRisk) and thereby the positive predictive power of at-risk criteria. Based on the literature, we expect a lower first-year conversion rate compared to adults (<20%), while the second-year conversion rate (no change, increase or decrease compared the first-year) is unclear. The seven secondary aims are: (1) to assess the prevalence rates of at-risk criteria, and sociodemographic and neuropsychological predictors, proposed to enhance predictive accuracy, and to identify the main predictors of conversion to psychosis in AtRisk. We expect a different set of predictors compared to adults; (2) to explore the risk enhancing properties of genetic polymorphisms; (3) to examine the risk enhancing properties of functional imaging data (in a subsample); (4) to assess the general outcome of AtRisk beyond conversion to psychosis and the role of life events in this; (5) to assess the prevalence of at-risk criteria prior to the onset of psychotic symptoms (in the prodromal phase) in a first admitted EOP sample and thereby the sensitivity of at-risk criteria in CAD. We expect an equal or higher sensitivity in EOP compared to AOP; (6) to assess prevalence rates and distributions of at-risk criteria and additional potential predictors of conversion to psychosis in a general population (GPS) as well as a clinical non-psychotic sample (ClinS) with diagnoses, for which an increased prevalence of subsequent psychosis were reported, allowing for calculation of negative predictive power and specificity estimates; and (7) to explore gender differences in the frequency and distribution of at-risk criteria.Methods: This is a prospective multi-centre naturalistic 3-year follow-up study (Bern, Zurich, Cologne) on altogether 209 AtRisk, 264 ClinS, 250 GPS and 100 EOP. At-risk symptoms and criteria will be assessed with the ‘Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes’ and the ‘Schizophrenia Prediction Instrument, Child & Youth version’. Further, sociodemographics and functioning measures, DSM-IV diagnoses as well as potential neuropsychological predictors of conversion (verbal fluency, verbal and working memory as well as processing speed) will be assessed. AtRisk and ClinS will be recruited over 2 years and followed annually at year 1 and 2, GPS will be recruited in year 1 and followed annually at year 1 and 2. Beyond the funded study period, all participating centres have agreed to further follow-up AtRisk until 5-year follow-up as in-house contributions. Repeated collection of saliva samples will allow genetic/epigenetic analyses.Expected value: Our study will be the first to examine the validity of current at-risk criteria as well as of proposed measures to enhance their accuracy (e.g., neuropsychology, genetics) in CAD and to provide starting points for their potential revision. With more and more CAD psychiatrists taking an interest in early detection and intervention in psychosis, the results of the proposed project will be received with immense interest by the international research community. The impact of the proposed study on future early detection research will vary depending on its results: If the sensitivity of ‘fulfilling any current at-risk criterion’ is low, especially in EOP, a completely different or additional set of at-risk criteria for CAD is needed. A more or less comprehensive revision of at-risk criteria for CAD, however, is needed, (i) if the positive predictive power of at-risk criteria is low in AtRisk, (ii) if their specificity and negative predictive power are low in ClinS and GPS and/or (iii) if their prevalence in GPS is high. Such revisions may include the addition of predictors, the elimination of single criteria and/or their redefinition in terms of frequency- and/or time-criteria. Overall, the study’s practical and potential economic impact will be considerable especially in light of the current discussion about the role of at-risk criteria in DSM-5 and the potential for further neurobiological research on this phenotype.

Klinisch-Biologische Wissenschaften Universität Basel	2011-03-01	2015-08-31	Epigenetic regulation of thyroid development	Epigenetic Regulation of Thyroid Development1.Summary1.1BackgroundEpigenetic events such as DNA and histone methylation and histone acetylation are fundamental for the regulation of normal cellular function. Reversible histone acetylation represents a major epigenetic mechanism controlling gene expression in differentiating cells. Normal thyroid follicular cell (TFC) precursors are characterized by the simultaneous expression of a specific set of a few transcription factors, while differentiated TFCs express the all functional proteins necessary for thyroid hormone synthesis. We have previously demonstrated that thyroid specific genes are activated in a sequential manner during normal human thyroid development. We have further established the signature of TFC differentiation by sequential transcriptome analysis, revealing dynamic expression of proteins with histone acetylase activity. Preliminary results in the murine model in vivo and in vitro support the concept of developmentally regulated acetylation level during TFC differentiation. The so far incomplete understanding regarding the epigenetic mechanisms underlying TFC differentiation provides the rationale for the proposed project. 1.2Working HypothesisWe postulate that histone acetylation regulates the sequential gene expression program during normal TFC differentiation and hence, plays a fundamental role for normal thyroid development and function.1.3Specific Aims Expanding our previous work, we seek to address the following unsolved questions.Aim 1: Analysis of the effect of histone acetylation and of specific HDACs for TFC differentiation.Aim 1: Identification of genes and pathways regulated by histone acetylation and specific HDACs.1.4Experimental DesignTo investigate the effect of histone acetylation during different stages of TFC differentiation, murine embryonic thyroid tissues in vivo and after specific experimental modification of the acetylation status in a culture model in vitro will be analyze by state-of-the-art methods of cellular and molecular biology.1.5Expected Value of the Proposed ProjectThe proposed experiments are expected to provide novel insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms which regulate normal thyroid development and onset of thyroid function. The combination of the two proposed aims will allow us to understand more in depth the general role of histone acetylation for thyroid development and function by identification of 1) effectors and 2) targets of acetylation during TFC differentiation. The clinical significance of this knowledge lies in the association of aberrant epigenetic changes and thyroid disease. Deciphering the epigenetic regulation of TFC differentiation is likely to provide a better understanding how human thyroid diseases, such as thyroid dysgenesis and thyroid cancer are linked to a deregulated histone code.

Klinisch-Biologische Wissenschaften Universität Basel	2016-04-01	2019-03-31	Cellular and molecular analysis of thymus organogenesis and maintenance	Background: The thymus provides the physiological microenvironment for the development of the majority of T lymphocytes. Hence, its function is critical for the successful establishment and maintenance of the immune system's capacity to distinguish between vital self and injurious non-self. This competence is primarily instructed by thymic epithelial cells (TECs). However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms controlling thymus formation, homeostatic maintenance and function are at present only incompletely understood. Detailed knowldege of the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that control regular TEC biology will provide important insight into an essential component of the adaptive immune system that can be exploited for the design of new diagnostic tools and novel therapeutic approaches intended to restore thymus function in advanced age or different disease states. This research proposal seeks to (i) identify and characterize target genes of the transcription factor Foxn1, a cell-autonomous master regulator of TEC differentiation and growth (Specific Aim 1); (ii) probe the importance of post-translational histone 3 methylation by components of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) for fate commitment to and function of TEC (Specific Aim 2); and (iii) elucidate the role of a family of let-7 micro RNAs (miRNA) and their regulatory binding protein Lin28 for regular TEC biology (Specific Aim 3). Working Hypothesis The proposed research is based on the testable hypotheses that TEC development is dependent on (i) Foxn1-controlled target gene expression that likely will differ between fetal and post-natal thymic epithelia; (ii) correct PRC2 activity and (iii) the presence of let-7 microRNAs. Specific Aims:#1: To define the Foxn1 controlled transcription at distinct TEC developmental stages, and to characterize the function of selected target genes in relation to specific developmental stages #2: To delineate the role of H3K27-methylation and the core PRC2 components in TEC development and function#3: To determine the role of let-7 miRNA and Lin28 controlled transcripts for TEC development and function. Experimental Design and MethodsAdvantages in modern mouse gene engineering combined with state of the art bioinformatic, molecular and cell biology methods will be used to address these specific aims. In particular, experiments have been designed to characterize the role of Foxn1 in early thymus organogenesis using (i) single cell transcriptomics and unsupervised bioinformatic algorithms that establish the biological progression between individual cellular states and (ii) gene targeting in TEC. To investigate the individual roles of specific Foxn1 target genes, PRC2 components, and let7 miRNA family members, we propose to employ specific gene targeting of TEC and their deep phenotyping at both a cellular and molecular level. Expected Value of the Proposed ProjectThe proposed experiments are expected to provide novel insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for regular TEC function and maintenance. Research into the biology of the thymus is helped by the facts that the thymus (i) develops relatively late during embryogenesis, (ii) is amenable to extensive ex vivo manipulations including reaggregation cultures and organ transplants, (iii) provides an anatomically and functionally unique system that in many ways is distinct from that of other epithelial organs; and (iv) exercises a role vital to health, namely the generation of functionally competent T cells. Information gained from the outlined studies will therefore be relevant not only to the fields of immunology, developmental biology and regenerative medicine, but is also expected to add significantly to efforts aimed at regenerating thymus function in the context of congenital and acquired deficiencies.

Klinisch-Biologische Wissenschaften Universität Basel	2017-03-01	2020-02-29	Transcriptional control and Epigenetic Mechanisms of Thymic Epithelial Cell Development and Function	1.1. Background The thymic microenvironment is unique in its ability to promote the development and selection of naïve T cells with a repertoire purged of vital “Self” specificities but prepared to react to injurious “Non-Self”. Essential for this competence are thymic epithelial cells (TEC). These constitute the major component of the thymic stroma and are categorized into separate cortical (c) and medullary (m) lineages based on their specific molecular, structural and functional characteristics. cTEC attract blood-borne precursor cells, commit them to a T cell fate, foster their differentiation and positively select cells that express a T cell antigen receptor (TCR) of sufficient affinity for self-antigens. Subsequently, both cTEC and mTEC deplete thymocytes that display a TCR with significant reactivity to self-antigens, a process known as negative selection, authorizing the generation of a diversified T cell repertoire with versatile antigen-recognition capacity. TEC differentiation and growth are dependent on the expression of the transcription factor FOXN1, a master regulator required for normal TEC biology. The precise molecular and cellular mechanisms that control TEC formation, their differentiation into separate lineages, their life-long homeostatic maintenance and the preservation of their complex function are, however, only incompletely understood. Detailed knowledge of the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that control regular TEC biology will therefore provide important insight into an essential component of the adaptive immune system.This research proposal (i) seeks to identify distinct cellular stage in cTEC and mTEC maturation, respectively, and probe the genetic control that commends their differentiation (Specific Aim 1); (ii) explores the role of the proteasome component ß5t, a target of FOXN1 (Specific Aim 2); and (iii) elucidates the plasticity in mTEC development as a function of epigenetic regulation (Specific Aim 3). 1.2. Working Hypothesis The proposed research is based on the testable hypotheses that the differentiation of thymic epithelia into the functionally separate cortical and medullary lineages is instructed by specific genetic circuits that require FOXN1-mediated target gene expression in conjunction with the correct placement of epigenetic marks. 1.3. Specific Aims:#1: To identify the genetic control of TEC differentiation into distinct cortical and medullary linages #2: To investigate the role of Psmb11, a developmentally regulated Foxn1 target gene, in cTEC function#3: To examine the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-independent pathway of mTEC differentiation1.4. Expected Value of the Proposed ProjectThe proposed research will establish in unprecedented molecular details the mechanisms important in TEC lineage differentiation and function. Specifically, information gained from the outlined studies will allow a refined understanding of the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms operative in regular TEC biology. This insight is not only essential to appreciate the immune systems’ competence to establish tolerance to “Self” whilst maintaining an ability to generate a protective response to “Non-Self” but is also fundamental for the design of efforts aimed in the immediate future to regenerate thymus function in the context of congenital and acquired deficiencies. The research consortium The research proposed here builds on original observations made, in part, jointly and over the course of the last 10 years by the laboratories of the two principal applicants, G. Holländer and Y. Takahama. Using innovative in vivo lineage fate mapping models, their research has recently established at single cell resolution the spatio-temporal dynamics that control the growth and maintenance of the separate TEC compartments. These results form the basis for the submitted research programme.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Japan	250000.0	CHF
1121	Günther Franz Ludger Hofbauer	University of Zurich	Dermatologische Klinik Universitätsspital Zürich	2016-01-01	2018-12-31	Susceptibility for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in organ transplant recipients	Skin cancers and skin inflammations like eczema or psoriasis are common skin diseases. Among those, actinic keratoses (AKs) are intraepithelial lesions that develop on sun-exposed surfaces of the skin such as the face, scalp or lower arms. These lesions result from UV-induced alterations in the epidermal part of the skin, and more specifically in keratinocytes. AKs may develop into invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (SCC) which is the second most common form of skin cancer worldwide. It is thus a major source of morbidity and cost overall. The incidence (number of new cases arising in a given period expressed as a rate per 100,000 persons per year) for SCC over the last 40 years is increasing at an impressive pace in Western European countries and particularly in Switzerland. Switzerland has the highest SCC incidence rate among all countries in mainland Europe. It has also the fastest increase from 14.2/100 000 person-years in 1978 to 28.9/100 000 person-years in 1997 and keeps increasing in numbers, both medically and economically.Some populations are at a greatly elevated risk for SCC of the skin. Organ transplant recipients (OTRs) achieve maintenance of their graft by immunosuppressive medication which suppresses transplant rejection. Calcineurin inhibition is the cornerstone of most immunosuppressive regimes. This success of modern transplantation medicine is, however, countered by an increased cancer risk in this population. SCC is the most frequent complication in organ transplant recipients at a risk increased 60- to 100-fold compared to the general population. SCC in OTR is characterized by a higher risk of metastasis in up to 20% of cases and shows a more aggressive course than SCC in the general population. Not infrequently, successfully transplanted patients suffer a great burden in their quality of life and sometimes even a vital threat by the formation of SCC. The commonly used calcineurin inhibitor, cyclosporine A (CsA), directly induces tumor growth in murine models and in humans via transcription factor ATF3 and increases the secretion of transforming growth factor-ß and vascular endothelia growth factor conductive to SCC formation. While some mechanisms for this greatly increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin have been elucidated, open questions remain. However, not all patients undergoing immunosuppressive treatment develop SCC, some are heavily affected, others hardly. Therefore, this project proposes to integrate transcriptome with epigenetic and functional analysis to understand genetic predisposition to cancer, with SCC in OTR as a focus. Generally, the possible role of genetic/epigenetic modifications of gene networks in SCC predisposition is largely unexplored. Thus, identifying patient- and tumor-specific differences will provide a comprehensive landscape of actionable targets. As a consequence, this expanding knowledge has implications for all aspects of cancer management, including prevention, screening, and treatment.We will address two main aims: 1)To test the hypothesis that different susceptibility of OTR patients to skin SCC is linked to different expression of genes with key regulatory function in keratinocytes and skin homeostasis.2)To assess in primary keratinocytes derived from OTRs the difference in their tumor forming/yielding capability in a manner that can be explained by different genetic and/or epigenetic control of key regulatory genes.

1122	Ueli Grossniklaus	University of Zurich	Institut für Pflanzen- und Mikrobiologie Universität Zürich	2012-05-01	2015-04-30	The Genetic and Molecular Basis of Gametogenesis and Maternal Effects in Arabidopsis	Gametogenesis and the maternal control of embryogenesis have been studied extensively in animal systems at the genetic, molecular, and cellular level. These studies have yielded insight into fundamental concepts and mechanism involved in the establishment and interpretation of positional information, cell-cell interaction, and signal transduction cascades. In contrast, our knowledge about genetic and molecular control of these processes in plants is very limited. The simple but highly polar and specialized female gametophyte, which consists of only seven cells belonging to four cell types, make it an ideal system to study the role of positional information and signaling during development. Using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model system, this proposal focuses on the elucidation of key events during sexual reproduction, namely cell specification, fertilization, and the epigenetic control of seed development with a focus on embryogenesis. We will use a combination of (quantitative) genetic, cell biological, molecular, and computational approaches. Many of the methods are established in the laboratory and rely on standard genetic and molecular biology protocols. Others need special adaptations and have been optimized for the study of the elusive and inaccessible female gametophyte. However, also novel experimental approaches will be established and adapted to our system, such as (i) methods to investigate sister chromatid segregation, (ii) network analyses of cell type-specific transcriptomes; (iii) novel cloning approaches using next generation sequencing technology, (iv) genome-wide association studies to identify modifier loci, and (v) the development of genetic and transgenic tools to investigate embryogenesis uninfluenced by the endosperm. The experiments described in this proposal will shed light on fundamental aspects of plant development, such as the role of positional information, cell-cell interactions, signal transduction, and epigenetic gene regulation in development. Thus, they span numerous fields of developmental biology and will yield novel insights into developmental control mechanisms that transcend plant biology. For example, epigenetic mechanisms play an important role in growth and development. While the role of epigenetic gene regulation in cancer and disease has only become apparent over the last years, plant researchers have studied epigenetic phenomena for decades and have contributed much to our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms.

This program combines a PhD in Plant Sciences with a set of courses that will allow the PhD students involved to obtain skills and expertise for policy work.Plant reproductive isolation is a crucial component of plant evolution. Furthermore, it is essential to seed production, plant breeding, sustainable crop yields, and food security. This Research Module aims at gaining a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms, ecological consequences, and evolutionary significance of reproductive isolation at different levels. We will investigate the molecular nature and ecological significance of pre-pollination reproductive isolation, specifically the effect of a changing environment on pollinator-mediated selection in Subproject A, and the mechanism and evolutionary role of post-pollination crossing barriers in speciation processes in Subproject B. These projects involve approaches from diverse fields such as genomics, ecology, evolutionary biology, genetics, statistics, as well as cell and molecular biology and thus offer a unique opportunity for young scientists to obtain interdisciplinary training. Importantly, the two PIs, whose backgrounds are in evolutionary ecology (Schiestl) and molecular genetics (Grossniklaus), have ongoing successful collaborations, illustrating the power of combining approaches from distinct fields in a joint effort. The two proposed subprojects require the expertise from both partners and could not be performed by one group alone. Pollinators mediate reproductive success in many plants and can thus select for floral traits. Little is known, however, about the details of pollinator-mediated selection, partly because of the lack of experimental data. Here we propose to assess the speed and evolutionary impact of an experimentally manipulated pollinator environment. From a starting population of rapid cycling Brassica rapa with extremely short generation time, three treatment groups with 5 replicates of 20 individuals each will be formed randomly and will be successively exposed to three different pollination types (honey bees, flies, random hand pollination as control) in a flight cage during 15 generations. Reproductive success, floral traits, as well as phenotypic selection gradients will be assessed in the three treatment groups during and after the experiment using multivariate statistics. In addition, the combined effect of herbivores and pollinators, and the role of sensory preferences of the different pollinator insects for pollinator-mediated selection will be investigated. After the selection experiment, the plants will be investigated at the molecular level to identify selected genetic and possibly epigenetic changes. The results will help us to understand whether changing pollinators lead to altered selection and whether changed selection regimes cause a short-term evolutionary response in plants. Mechanisms of reproductive isolation are central to evolution because they determine the rate of genetic exchange between populations and ultimately contribute to speciation. To date, there is a lack of studies that examine the molecular basis of reproductive isolation and evolutionary processes that operate on the level of genes. Successful plant reproduction relies on manifold interactions between the male and female reproductive tissues. One of the last steps prior to double fertilization is pollen tube reception: after penetrating a synergid cell, the pollen tube arrests its growth, ruptures, and releases the two sperm cells. The Arabidopsis FERONIA (FER) receptor-like kinase is required for this process. Since some interspecific crosses phenocopy the fer mutant, FER likely plays a role in establishing reproductive barriers and mediates a species-specific interaction. The goal of this subproject is to investigate the role of such a cellular recognition process in the ecology and evolution of species boundaries, using a combination of approaches from evolutionary genomics and molecular genetics. We will investigate the selective forces that acted during the evolution of FER and identify new components of this post-pollination reproductive barrier using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in Arabidopsis thaliana. We will test whether pre-pollination isolation also affects this post-pollination process to increase compatible mating outcomes by analyzing allele frequencies of the Brassica orthologs of FER and the new candidate loci indentified by GWAS in the control and pollinator-treatment Brassica populations of Subproject A.

Together with other cells of the innate immune system, DC induce the development of various different types of T cell responses designed to clear a specific pathogen and/or avoid immunopathology. These responses are mediated by diverse CD4+ T cell subsets, including TH1, TH2, TH9, TH17, TH22, and regulatory T (Treg) cells. Little is known about how DC interpret and integrate the multiple signals to which they are exposed, thereby enabling them to ensure appropriate education of the responding T cells This decision is decisive, because it determines the balance between recovery and chronic disease or death.DC are remarkably precise at distinguishing between the myriads of different pathogens by integrating both environmental and pathogen-derived signals. DC are equipped with numerous pathogen and stress recognition receptors - including Toll-like receptors (TLR) - and they integrate diverse signals received via these receptors to elaborate suitable responses.. A key cytokine in this process is IL-12. Bioactive IL-12 is composed of a p40 and a p35 chain. It has been observed that single signals induce IL-12 p40, whereas additional signals are required for expression of the p35 chain. IL-12 induces the differentiation of TH1 T cells, which are critical for immune responses directed against intracellular pathogens, such as viruses and parasites. Known signals collaborating in inducing the production of bioactive IL-12 are: two TLR signals (one signaling via TRIF, the other via MyD88), activation by TLR + cytokines or TLR + CLR. It is surprising that the stimulation of so many different combinations of structurally unrelated receptors leads to such a similar synergy.The central aim of this project is to use a systems biology approach to decipher the molecular mechanisms that underpin the type of synergy observed for IL-12 production by DC. We are in the unique position to be able to generate unlimited amounts of fully functional DC displaying synergistic responses by exploiting newly developed stable DC lines. These cell lines will be produced, cultivated and stimulated for the participating laboratories by group 1 (H. Acha Orbea). Group 1 will also determine and characterize changes in mRNA stability occurring in response to different stimuli, extend key findings to freshly isolated DC, and perform molecular characterizations of the newly discovered pathways. Group 2 (M. Mann) will analyze the phosphoproteome by means of state-of-the-art SILAC technology. Group 3 (W. Reith) will document epigenetic changes, assess promoter occupation by signal responsive transcription factors, and quantify transcription rates. Finally, the 4th group (Xenarios) will ensure bioinformatic analysis and integration of the generated data.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Sinergia	2000000.0	CHF

Cancer cells are characterized by a complex interplay between genetic and epigenetic abnormalities that drive the evolution of the malignancy. Epigenetic influences not only gene expression but also telomeres function as well as genomic stability. Epigenetic of pNETs is poorly understood. Mutations in DAXX (Death associated protein 6) or ATRX (ATR-X gene) with correspondent loss of proteins expression occur in 40% of pNETs. DAXX and ATRX negative tumors show ALT (Alternative Lengthening Telomeres) activation a mechanism for telomeres length maintenance, telomerase independent. We have recently shown that loss of DAXX or ATRX predicts for poor disease outcome and that DAXX/ATRX negative tumors show chromosomal instability. DAXX and ATRX regulate the epigenetic status of the cells by mediating both chromatin structure organization and DNA methylation. Preliminary results obtained in our group indicate that DAXX/ATRX negative tumors show a lower level of global DNA methylation compared to positive ones. I hypothesize that DAXX/ATRX loss in pNETs induces an epigenetic reprogramming affecting gene expression as well as telomeres functions and genomic instability. These epigenetic abnormalities may drive the evolution of this subtype of tumors. In the current proposal I aim to: 1. Describe a specific epigenetic profile of DAXX/ATRX negative and ALT positive tumors2. Identify epigenetically regulated players of DAXX/ATRX negative pNETs development and validate their expression 3. Assess the capacity of the identified candidates to mediate response to anti-tumoral treatment. DNA-methylation arrays will be performed on 50 pNET human samples. Methylation profiles will be integrated with gene, miRNA and LncRNA expression data obtained on 30 samples respectively by gene expression arrays and Nanostring technology. Expression of interesting candidates found to be dysregulated from the comparative analysis will be validated on additional samples by Immunohistochemiestry, qRT-PCR and RNA in situ hybridization. Primary cells derived from pNET patients will be treated with different drugs currently in use for pNETs treatment as well as DNA demethylating agents and when possible with drugs targeting the new identified dysregulated pathways.

The famine cohort studies, for example, revealed the impact of human malnutrition on offspring metabolic parameters. Epigenetic modifications are excellent molecular candidates for the transgenerational transmission of information about the environment. Chromatin modifications and DNA methylation, as well as maternal RNA, are passed from parent to offspring through the gametes. All three have the potential to fine-tune gene expression in the offspring according to conditions experienced by the parents. To date, however, we are far from understanding the role of these mechanisms in transgenerational inheritance in wild vertebrate populations. We do not even know whether epigenetic information co-varies with the natural genetic variation in a population.The recent invasion of Neogobius melanostomus (the round goby) in the High Rhine provides us with an excellent environmental model to study transgenerational inheritance in a wild vertebrate population. Neogobius melanostomus is an invasive benthic fish with high adaptation capabilities. We have established the procedures to obtain mature eggs, early embryos and juveniles in large quantities from the wild and to breed the fish in the lab. Also thanks to own previous work, the genome will be available in autumn 2015 and maternal RNA profiles will be available early 2016. This project will provide first insight whether chromatin marks in a wild adapting vertebrate co-vary with genetic variation, and whether chromatin marks integrate environmental information. This knowledge is a precondition for future studies on the transgenerational transmission of epigenetic information about the environment, and thus on the role of epigenetic marks in adaptation processes of wild vertebrate populations.

Many of the cancer cell properties that have been detected or proposed decades ago, including their heterogeneity despite clonal origin and their capacity to subvert the host tissue stroma, have yet to be fully understood and metastasis, the main cause of cancer-related death, remains virtually unscathed by the therapeutic arsenal currently at hand. To complicate issues further, it is becoming increasingly clear that epigenetic changes may play a key role in tumor progression and resistance to therapy and even override the influence of genetic mutations themselves. The long term goal of this project is to acquire a better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie cancer initiation, development and progression with the hope that such understanding will help identify new therapeutic targets and lead to rationally designed, effective therapeutic strategies. We have chosen to work on sarcomas, which include some of the most aggressive tumors, often arising in children and young adults and associated with a somber prognosis despite multimodal therapy. Because these malignancies have not been investigated as intensely as the more common carcinomas, they are still poorly understood from a biological standpoint. The short term goal is to determine the nature of tumor cell heterogeneity in sarcomas, the properties that distinguish sarcoma stem/initiator cells (CSC/CIC) from the bulk of tumor cells, including their chromatin modifications and bioenergetics, the possibilities to distinctly target CSC/CIC therapeutically and the mechanisms that render mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSC/MPC) permissive for specific oncogene expression and action and thereby elucidate how sarcomas are generated. These issues will be addressed using Ewing sarcoma family tumors (ESFT) as a model, but other sarcoma types, and possibly other malignancies will be investigated as the project unfolds. The specific aims are as follows:Specific Aim 1: Assessment of the effect of targeted therapy, alone or in combination with standard of care treatment, on ESFT CSC/CIC and tumor growth. This section will include:1.1. Analysis of the effect of fluoroquinolones alone on primary ESFT growth in vivo ; 1.2. Analysis of the effect of combined standard of care and fluoroquinolone treatment on primary ESFT growth in vivo;1.3. Assessment of the properties of residual tumors following single and combined therapy in terms of tumor initiation, clonogenicity and resistance to therapy ;1.4. Assessment of the broader applicability of fluoroquinolones in CSC targeting: investigation of their effect alone or in combination with conventional therapy in glioblastomas;Specific Aim 2: Determination of epigenetic mechanisms that regulate ESFT CSC properties. This section will include:2.1. Determination of chromatin modification in spherogenic versus adherent cells;2.2. Determination of chromatin modification in CD133+ versus CD133- cells;2.3 RNA-seq analysis of CD133+ versus CD133- cells and assessment of 3’UTR length;Specific Aim 3: Assessment of the epigenetic changes in MSC grown under different culture conditions. This section will include:3.1. Assessment of chromatin modifications in MSC grown in KO versus normal medium;3.2. Assessment of chromatin modifications of MSC grown as spheres versus adherent cells;3.3. Assessment of chromatin modifications of MSC expressing EWS-FLI1; Specific Aim 4: Assessment of ESFT CSC bioenergetics as viewed through the function of Imp2 and the requirement or not for oxidative phosphorylation. This section will include:4.1. Assessment of mRNA binding by Imp2 in ESFT CSC versus bulk cells;4.2. Assessment of Imp2 phosphorylation in ESFT CSC versus bulk cells;	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div. I-III)	751000.0	CHF
1128	Jardena Puder	University of Lausanne	Division d'endocrinologie, diabétologie et du métabolisme Département de médecine interne - CHUV	2017-11-01	2021-10-31	Improving metabolic and mental health in women with gestational diabetes and their offspring	Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most frequent pregnancy complications (up to 20% of pregnancies) and increases the risk for non-communicable diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes in the mother and/or her child, as well as the risk for postpartum depression. GDM is also involved in the fetal programming of long-term metabolic health. GDM risk factors that are potentially modifiable during pregnancy include excessive pregnancy weight gain, high fat consumption, physical inactivity, psychosocial stress, depression, and lack of social support. Lifestyle interventions for the treatment of GDM are often limited to nutrition or physical activity. They usually treat the mother or the child separately, take place either only during or after pregnancy, and their results are inconsistent. The multifactorial origins of GDM and the tight link between metabolic and mental as well as maternal and child health call for an interdisciplinary intervention. Due to the complex nature and the transgenerational transmission of these non-communicable diseases, we aim to scale-up from the few existing interventions to a concerted complex, multidimensional interdisciplinary intervention: Aim: To test the effects of a complex, interdisciplinary lifestyle and psychosocial continuous pre-and postpartum intervention to improve metabolic and mental health outcomes in women with GDM and their children up to 1 year postpartum. Primary aim: We expect that the 1) the decrease in maternal weight between study enrolment after GDM diagnosis and maternal weight at 1 yr postpartum will be larger in the intervention group than in the control group and 2) that the decrease in maternal symptoms of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression score (EPDS) during the same time period will be larger in the intervention group than in the control group. Secondary aims: We expect that the intervention will improve other indicators of maternal and offspring metabolic and mental health at enrolment, the peri- and postpartum period. We will also investigate longitudinal associations, thus increasing the understanding of the trajectories of maternal and child obesity, glucose intolerance and mental health problems. Maternal secondary outcomes are (1) fat mass, gestational weight gain and weight retention, lifestyle behaviours, aerobic fitness and strength, metabolic and epigenetic laboratory biomarkers and (2) other mental health indicators. Offspring secondary outcomes are (1) body composition, metabolic and epigenetic laboratory biomarkers and (2) mental health indicators, such as self-regulation. Method: Monocentric superiority open randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 200 women with GDM and their offspring randomly assigned (1:1) to either the intervention or the control group (treatment-as-usual). Patients will be recruited at 24-32 wks of gestation after GDM diagnosis. The intervention will take place during pregnancy and the first year postpartum. On top of usual care offered in the control group, the intervention consists of 7 individual interdisciplinary sessions with dieticians, physiotherapists, clinical psychologists, and two group sessions. The team will provide counseling regarding weight gain recommendations and focus on specific dietary aspects (reduction of total lipid intake, prioritization of higher quality fats and reduction of red or processed meats; mindful eating techniques, and regular structured eating). It will also provide encouragement for aerobic and resistance physical activity, screening for and treatment of depression using a stepped care approach and facilitated self-help, and social support offers including support from services, peers and partner. Treatment goals for the infant focus on diet (continuation of breastfeeding for at least 6 months, recognition of hunger and satiety cues and use of different soothing strategies), physical activity and mental health (self regulation capacity). Patients will be supported by a lifestyle coach. Assessors measuring the primary outcomes and other outcomes, such as biomarkers and questionnaires, and the statistician will be blind to group allocation. For the assessment of outcomes, validated online questionnaires and standardised devices, such as calibrated scales, accelerometer, bioimpedance, Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and standardised motor tests will be used. Importance and impact: This RCT allows evaluating if a complex, interdisciplinary continuous pre-and postpartum lifestyle and psychosocial intervention leads to an improvement in both maternal and child metabolic and mental health outcomes. This study would also provide relevant findings regarding the understanding of GDM and potential pathways regarding the link between lifestyle, epigenetic mechanisms and metabolic, and mental health. This could result in significant changes in clinical practice and guidelines.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div. I-III)	714154.0	CHF

While localized prostate cancer is highly curable, nearly all patients with metastatic disease progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer for which there are presently limited treatment options. Thus, there is high need to develop selective, context-dependent therapeutic strategies to manage metastatic prostate cancer. The identification of the pathways that, in a specific tumor context, lead to disease progression and metastasis is an important step in developing more effective treatments based on the tumor molecular and biological characteristics.The overall goal of this SSAJRP application is to combine and integrate the expertise of the participating groups at two leading Institutions in Switzerland (IOR) and in South Africa (ICGEB) to improve the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in tumor progression and to discover novel therapeutic approaches for a specific subtype of prostate cancers, ERG fusion positive tumors. The participating teams have long term experience in prostate cancer biology, genomics and experimental therapeutics and, along with the excellent facilities and resources available in the respective Institutions, constitute an unique work environment to perform this project with high relevant basic, translational and clinical implications. Furthermore, this bilateral project will provide an ideal platform and framework for training students and young scientists in an international setting in both countries. Gene fusions involving the ETS transcription factor ERG are found in about half of prostate cancers. The gene fusion determine overexpression of full length ERG in prostate epithelial cells. Pre-clinical and clinical data sustain the notion that activation of multiple oncogenic pathways cooperating with ERG is required for progression of ERG fusion positive tumors. However, the molecular details of these interactions are not defined yet. Understanding these mechanisms would be important for the development of more effective therapies. We have recently discovered a novel mechanism leading to aberrant activation of ERG and contributing to prostate cancer progression. We identified EZH2, a key epigenetic effector, as an important element enhancing the oncogenic activity of ERG and at the center of cross-talks between ERG and the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway in prostate cancer. We found that EZH2 enhances ERG transcriptional activity, forms with ERG co-activator and co-repressor complexes, and thus contributes to transcriptional reprogramming and acquisition of tumorigenic and metastatic properties. Notably, the genes co-occupied and co-regulated by ERG and EZH2 constitute a gene signature predictive of adverse prognosis and highly enriched in metastatic prostate cancers. Furthermore, we showed that antagonizing the ERG and EZH2 interaction with EZH2 targeting agents could be highly effective to treat patients with aggressive ERG positive tumors. The studies proposed in this application will address the role of ERG in orchestrating and remodeling the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape in prostate tumors by examining the network of co-regulatory factors co-opted by the ERG/EZH2 complexes to activate the pro-tumorigenic and pro-metastatic program. To this end, we plan to integrate molecular, genomic and functional studies in vitro and in vivo with human patient data to understand the events involved in the cross-talks between ERG, EZH2 and transcriptional co-regulators and to examine the biological and clinical consequences. Furthermore, we will examine strategies aimed at reversing ERG pro-tumorigenic/pro-metastatic program by targeting the key components of the ERG-orchestrated epigenetic network. Accordingly, the specific aims of the present applications are: Aim 1. To understand the molecular mechanisms of the ERG-orchestrated transcriptional reprogramming and tumor progression in ERG positive prostate cancer. Aim 2. To explore therapeutic approaches to reverse ERG-dependent reprogramming and progression in prostate cancer. Collectively, the combination of genomic, molecular and functional in vitro and in vivo studies proposed in this SSAJRP application will lead to a deeper understanding of the biological mechanisms leading to transformation and progression in ERG-dependent prostate cancers. Furthermore, these studies will reveal therapeutically actionable pathways whose modulation could have a broad impact on the management of prostate cancer.

Taken together, these diseases affect ~50million people worldwide. AD, the most common form, is characterized by the cerebral deposition ofaggregated amyloid ß (Aß) and tau, while PD is characterized by neuronal inclusions known as Lewybodies that are comprised of the protein a-synuclein (a-syn). In prion diseases, the aggregated misfoldedprion protein, called prion, is widespread in the CNS. A large body of histopathological, genetic, andexperimental studies clearly implicates the conversion of native proteins into abnormal distinctconformations as a key step in the variegate disease pathogenesis. In this proposal we aim at studyingthe molecular determinants of the so-called strain phenomenon in the different diseases and relate theresults to the functional and clinical outcome using several experimental tools. First, we plan to use smallmolecules to discriminate different structural conformers of Aß, tau and a-syn. These molecules includeluminescent conjugated oligothiophenes. In vitro and in vivo testing in cellular and animal models andhuman autopsy brains from clinically characterized disease cases will parallel biochemical and biophysical characterizations of such disease-related conformers. In addition, we propose theidentification of genetic/epigenetic risk or protective factors through a high-throughput siRNA andRNSseq screenings for modifiers involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases. These latter twoapproaches will be paralleled by the study of the genes identified through in vitro and in vivo approaches for the development of novel experimental models for these diseases.The work plan proposed will address the genetic, epigenetic and environmental risk and protective factors and it will allow the development of novel advanced experimental models of neurodegenerative diseases.

Currently, 300 million people (4.2%) suffer from asthma, 500 million (6.5%) from atopic dermatitis (AD), 900 million (12 %) from allergic rhinitis) and 700 million (9%) from food allergy worldwide. The prevalence of these four allergic diseases is approximately 1.7 million 22% in Switzerland. Atopic dermatitis is the most prevalent chronic disease in childhood. Asthma represents one of the highest costs to health care system. Allergic rhinitis is the number one disease for job absenteeism (missing work days) and presenteeism (being on the job, but not fully functioning because of disease). Approximately, 5-10% of all of these diseases present with severe forms and can cause deaths. It was recently shown by us and others that epithelial tight junction barrier defect plays an important role in the pathogenesis of these diseases.Epithelial barrier function: of asthmatic bronchial epithelial cells, sinus epithelial cells in chronic rhinosinusitis and skin keratinocytes in atopic dermatitis have been demonstrated to be defective and leaky. Allergens, bacterial toxins and other particles are able to penetrate the leaky epithelium, where they may activate the immune system cells leading to severe chronic inflammation. Epithelial tight junctions (TJ) are responsible for the regulation of paracellular flux and epithelial impermeability and can be considered as gatekeepers that could contribute both to aggravation of inflammation-related tissue damage or resolution of inflammation via drainage towards out side of the affected tissues. This study focuses on the regulation of particularly TJ barrier by epigenetic mechanisms and inflammasome.Planned experiments: According to our strong preliminary data, we hypothesize here that “epithelial tight junction barrier is epigenetically controlled” and “epithelial barrier leakiness is affected by inflammasome and both TJ barrier and inflammasome are epigenetically regulated”. We will perform this research in asthma and atopic dermatitis in parallel and particularly focus on in vivo relevant findings that will be obtained from direct human primary cells and biopsies as well as mouse models. We aim to demonstrate epigenetic mechanisms of bronchial and skin epithelial barrier leakiness in different endotypes and phenotypes of asthma and atopic dermatitis and bring a new perspective from bench to patient side. We will use several important and in vivo relevant stimulants to study the “barrier”, “epigenetics” and “inflammasome” triangle. They will be house dust mite, human rhinovirus, commercial detergents and their surfactants, and CpG oligonucleotides. In this way, we will be able to investigate barrier damaging and recovering as well as inflammasome-activating and -nonactivating stimulants.Impact and innovative potential: The ultimate aim of this research is to find out novel preventive and treatment ways for two major allergic diseases, asthma and atopic dermatitis to decrease the individual burden of the patients and their families, which affects almost half of the World’s population and extremely high health care costs. Our research includes disease endo and phenotyping concepts and opens a new window for a precision medicine approach to barrier leakiness, such as the establishment of leaky barrier endotype. Many aspects of this research will find broader impact in other disciplines of human and veterinary medicine, because similar mechanisms of epithelial barrier dysregulation play roles in other diseases such as chronic rhinosinusitis, COPD and inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, epigenetic regulation of inflammasome activation thresholds has a link to essentially all inflammatory diseases.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div.

1132	Alain Malafosse	University of Geneva	Département de Psychiatrie Faculté de Médecine Université de Genève	2013-10-01	2014-01-31	Genome-wide association and whole-genome methylation studies of suicidal behaviour	Background: Suicidal behaviour, now recognised as a clinical entity per se, is one of the most significant psychiatric public health problems. Suicidal behaviour is likely to be a product of interactions between several common gene variants and both distal and proximal environmental factors. Epigenetic factors most likely underlie these gene-environment interactions. Only a few number of susceptibility genes have been consistently associated to suicidal behaviour, and an even lower number of epigenetic variations have been associated to suicidal behaviour. Aims of the project: The first aim of this project is to search for new genetic variants involved in the vulnerability to suicide attempt (SA) and suicide completion (SC) by using a genome-wide association study (GWAS). The second aim is to compare the global methylation status of the genome between SC and controls. The third aim is to explore how associated SNPs in step 1 affect the variation of the methylation levels found in step 2.Methods: 1) In a precedent GWAS we identified, in a sample of 1’567 cases and controls, association which almost reaches the genome-wide significance level (p=9.97*10-8), with rs10779481 located near PLXNA2, a gene encoding a member of the plexin-A family of semaphoring co-receptors. We have collected new DNAs from 3’884 subjects. Diagnoses were made according to DSM-IV criteria, using the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Suicidal behaviour characteristics were defined using the Suicide Intent Scale and the Risk-Rescue Rating in Suicide assessment. DNAs will be genotyped with Illumina HumanOmni2.5-8 Beadchip. After quality control procedure and stratification analyses, a GWAS will firstly be performed on these new samples. Then a meta-analysis will be performed between these newly generated data and that of our first GWAS. 2) Using the Illumina Infinium® HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, global methylation status of DNA extracted from ventral prefrontal cortex will be compared between 324 suicide completers and 331 controls. A functional analysis of the genes identified will be conducted by looking at the enrichment of GO terms they are associated with as well as pathways they are involved in. We will finally query protein-protein interaction databases in order to build an interaction network of identified genes and determine core genes. 3) Finally we will explore how the SNPs identified in the first step modulate DNA methylation identified in step 2 in ventral PFC from suicide victims and controls. Linear regression of DNA methylation levels with number of the minor allele for each SNPs will be performed.Significance of the proposed project: This project is based on two unique SA and SC databases. Therefore they will offer a unique opportunity for identifying common vulnerability genes with small effect by GWAS and methylation differences between SC and for further exploring the functional effects of associated SNPs by testing how they may modulate methylation marks associated to suicide. This project could be therefore a major breakthrough in suicidology.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div. I-III)	150000.0	CHF

In the thymus, thymic epithelial cells (TECs) select a T cell repertoire that is tolerant to benign “self”, but responsive to potentially injurious “non-self”. For this process to be comprehensive, TECs express an almost complete repertoire of self-antigens, a capacity referred to as promiscuous gene expression (PGE), and present them to the developing T cells. The molecular mechanism that allows PGE is not fully known. My PhD project seeks to address this lack of a mechanistic understanding by studying the role of epigenetic regulation of PGE. Recently it has been discovered that promiscuously expressed genes are characterized by a repressive histone landscape. My working hypothesis is that repressive histone marks such as H3K27me3 are used in TECs to initiate PGE. My project therefore aims to test how changes in the H3K27me3 landscape alter TEC function and PGE. To this end I am studying the thymus of mice with a TEC specific deficiency of the H3K27me3 demethylases UTX and JMJD3 as well as mice with an absence of the PRC2 cofactor JARID2 in TECs. Using ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq these mouse models will allow me to directly correlate the H3K27me3 landscape with PGE.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Doc.Mobility	None	None
1134	Antoine Hendrik Felix Marie Peters	Institute Friedrich Miescher	Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research	2013-10-01	2016-09-30	Establishment of chromatin states in mouse sperm and their relevance for paternal epigenetic inheritance	Background: Histones and their post-translational modification have recently been suggested to mediate epigenetic inheritance of environmentally induced adap¬tive traits via the male germ line (Carone et al., 2010; Zeybel et al., 2012). In mammals, however, genomes of male germ cells are packaged in a highly condensed configuration. To enable the over 10-fold increase in compaction of the genome in spermatozoa, chromatin undergoes a dramatic remodeling along almost the entire genome at the end of spermatogenesis. Key events in this process are the removal of histones and their replacement first with transition proteins and subsequently with protamines (Govin et al., 2004). Nonetheless, this histone removal is not complete. In humans around 10% of histone proteins are retained on chromatin (Brykczynska et al., 2010; Hammoud et al., 2009), while in mice this number stands at 1%. These later findings raise the important question whether these retained histones would be involved in intergenerational transmission of epigenetic information, thereby contributing to gene regulation in offspring.Unpublished data from my laboratory shows that such retained histones are specifically positioned at regulatory regions of important developmental genes, even more explicitely in mouse than in human spermatozoa (Erkek et al., in preparation; Brykczynska et al., 2010). Furthermore, classes of genes serving distinct functions harbor different sets of post-translationally modified histones associated with either transcriptional activation or repression, in a manner that is predictive for expression states measured in early embryos. Importantly, we find that sequence composition is highly predictive for nucleosome enrichment genome-wide and that nucleosome occupancy inversely correlates with DNA methylation. Results from chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments with histone variant specific antibodies suggest specific functions for the canonical histones H3.1 and H3.2 versus the histone variant H3.3 in chromatin remodeling during spermiogenesis and possibly intergenerational epigenetic inheritance (Erkek et al., in preparation). Further preliminary data indicate the existence of an additional, evolutionary conserved, testis expressed histone H3 variant H3t with putative functions in histone eviction during spermiogenesis. Finally, we have observed, specifically in elongating spermatids, the presence of chromatin-bound histone H3 proteins that are cleaved at their N-termini. We speculate that histone clipping may function in the eviction of these proteins during spermiogenesis. On the basis of these data, we define a comprehensive research program that aims at elucidating the mechanisms underlying histone turnover and retention during spermatogenesis and paternal transmission of histone encoded epigenetic information directing gene expression in the next generation. Hypotheses:1.We hypothesize that nucleosomes containing different members of the histone H3 family are assembled onto and disassembled from chromatin during spermatogenesis by distinct pathways.2.We propose that these variant nucleosomes exhibit different properties on chromatin and are selectively evicted versus retained during spermiogenesis.3.We suggest that variant nucleosomes with specific posttranslational modifications that are retained in sperm play distinct roles in the regulation of gene expression in early embryos.Aims: To test these hypotheses we propose three aims that we will experimentally approach using a combination of biochemical, molecular genetic (transgenic and conditional deficiency mouse models), microscopy, epigenomic (ChIP and RNA sequencing) and bio-computational methods.1.To study the mechanisms underlying histone variant specific nucleosome remodeling during spermatogenesis and retention of H3.3 nucleosomes in spermatozoa. To investigate the role of H3.3 and H3t variants and of canonical H3.1 in spermatogenesis we will generate targeted inducible transgenic mice expressing epitope tagged versions of each of these H3 proteins. We will perform ChIP-Sequencing analyses in purified germ cells to determine the localization of specific H3 variants in the genome during spermatogenesis. We will use these transgenic mice to perform genetic pulse-chase experiments to determine when during spermatogenesis nucleosomes containing H3 variants become incorporated into chromatin. To identify chaperone and chromatin remodeler proteins interacting with the different H3 histones, we will perform immunoprecipitation experiments coupled to protein identification by mass spectrometry (IP/MS) on cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions isolated from germ cells at sequential stages of spermatogenesis. Finally, we will functionally characterize the role of H3 variants in spermatogenesis by generating conditional mutant mice for H3.3 and H3t genes as well as for candidate chromatin assembly factors identified by the IP/MS experiments. 2.To determine the mechanism and function of histone clipping in nucleosomal eviction during spermiogenesis. Unpublished data indicate the existence of chromatin-bound H3 proteins cleaved around residue Glycine 33 in purified elongating spermatids. In vitro assays indicate that the proteolytic activity may reside in a serine or threonine protease. To investigate the function of histone cleavage in nucleosome eviction, we will first identify the precise cleavage site using Edman degradation and sophisticated MS approaches. We will subsequently generate antibodies recognizing cleaved histones. We will then perform biochemical fractionation studies combined with IP/MS detection methods to identify the protease involved. To elucidate the function of the protease in histone eviction, we will generate conditionally deficient mice and study histone cleavage in relation to turnover during spermatogenesis. Likewise, we will generate transgenic mice expressing uncleavable point mutants of H3 proteins in an inducible manner. 3.To elucidate the role of paternally inherited histone proteins in the regulation of early embryonic gene expression. We will use sperm from transgenic males heterozygous for the epitope tagged H3 transgenes (described in Aim 1) to produce pre-implantation embryos. Using microscopy approaches we will then track the presence of tagged H3 in genetically wild-type versus transgenic early embryos to determine whether and how long paternally inherited histones are retained on DNA during early embryogenesis. In addition, we will generate mice expressing H3 variants lacking crucial modified residues to examine the role of residue specific histone modifications in paternal chromatin inheritance. We will examine expression of genes associated with modified histones in sperm in two-cell stage embryos sired by these mice to determine if embryonic gene expression is affected. Expected value: The proposed study comprises a systematic genetic and biochemical analysis of nucleosome remodeling and turnover processes occurring during spermatogenesis. We expect to answer the highly relevant and open question whether nucleosomes in mouse spermatozoa mediate transmission of epigenetic information between generations. We further anticipate to obtain detailed insights into the molecular mechanism underlying nucleosome eviction during spermatid differentiation, leading to the production of functional spermatozoa.

Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are pluripotent cells that can be derived from pre-implantation embryos at different stages of their development. In ESCs, cell identity is primarily regulated by transcription factors, e.g. Oct3/4, Sox2, and Nanog that are considered master regulators of pluripotency in vivo and in vitro and share many target genes. Gene transcription occurs, however, in the context of chromatin that serves either potentiating or restricting functions. As such, chromatin-based mechanisms contribute to the translation of genetic information. A large number of studies have shown that chromatin modifiers play a conserved role in the heritability of cell identity during somatic differentiation and in safeguarding genome stability. Since such transmission of information occurs in absence of changes in the underlying genetic code, this type of inheritance is referred to as “epigenetic”. Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are evolutionarily conserved chromatin factors that mediate gene repression. In mammals, they function in at least two different multi-protein complexes, called Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC) 1 and 2, that mediate mono-ubiquitination of H2A at lysine 119 (H2AK119u1) and H3K27me3 respectively. These complexes typically repress genes with key regulatory functions in development and differentiation. Double-deficiency for the PRC1 paralogues, Ring1b/Rnf2 and Ring1a, causes a loss of ESC identity. Similarly, double deficiency for the core PRC1 components Ring1a and Ring1b/Rnf2 causes a developmental arrest around the eight-cell stage (unpublished data). Thus, as in ESCs, PRC1 function seems to be required for the development of totipotency during early embryogenesis. This grant application focuses on the targeting mechanisms of the PRC1 and their role in regulating cell identity of ESCs. In particular, it proposes to study the function of a family of Cbx proteins, components of PRC1, for targeting of PRC1 to chromatin and possibly specific sets of genes. These proteins contain a chromo domain that has affinity for methylated histones. The work proposed will assess to function of these chromo domains for PRC1 targeting. Furthermore, it concentrates on PRC1 function during early embryogenesis at the time of the first and second lineage decisions that ultimately give rise to the pluripotent inner cell mass and the two differentiation lineages (trophectoderm and primitive endoderm).Hypotheses1: We propose that the five different Cbx proteins contribute to target selection and specification of cell identity. We put forward that target specification is mediated, in part, by the CD of the different Cbx proteins. Furthermore, we propose that Cbx2 functions to inhibit binding of PRC1 complexes to H3K9 methylated chromatin, thereby contributing to partitioning of mammalian genomes ac-cording to epigenetic states.2: We hypothesize that the PRC1 complex and its component Cbx2 play important roles in regulating gene expression in early embryos, during the so-called maternal-to-zygotic transition in which transcription becomes activated in a largely genome-wide manner and during subsequent lineage specification. Cbx7 may be important for embryonic development towards the blastocyst stage.To investigate these hypotheses, we propose the following aims:1: To investigate the role of Cbx2, Cbx4, Cbx6, Cbx7, and Cbx8 in specifying PRC1 targeting and cell identity of undifferentiated and differentiating embryonic stem cells. 2: To assess the role of chromo domains of Cbx proteins in chromatin targeting of PRC1. 3: To determine the function of PRC1 and Cbx proteins in early embryogenesisPossible applicationsThe proposed work represents a systematic approach to dissect the mechanisms of transcriptional control by Polycomb group proteins in regulating cell identity of embryonic stem cells and during pre-implantation development. The anticipated results will provide insights into the controlling of transcriptional networks functioning in early embryos that direct the acquisition of totipotency (early stages) and drive differentiation into the first cellular lineages (later stage embryos). The mechanistic understanding obtained in these in vitro and vivo studies will aid the elucidation of epigenetic reprogramming mechanisms implicated in the generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells in vitro. As such, this work is expected to significantly contribute to studies on reprogramming of differentiated cells for therapeutic usage.

We have previously shown that low-to-high GLI and high-to-low WNT-TCF switching constitutes a metastatic transition for colon cancer cells. We have also shown that GLI function can drive reprogramming through define factors that results in a stable pro-metastatic state via epigenetic changes. Here we address the role of TMED genes, encoding factors- acting in protein trafficking and secretion- in the metastatic transition and the establishment of pro-metastatic states.This work is based on our previous demonstration that TMED3 is a WNT-TCF promoter and a metastatic suppressor in human colon cancer cells. The results from the proposed study should reveal novel mechanisms for the control of pro-metastatic states, revealing key aspects of cell plasticity and highlighting possible future avenues for therapeutic intervention.

Histone acetylation is an epigenetic mark crucial for DNA accessibility of transcription factors, but also of factors that control V(D)J recombination, class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM), processes that are the basis for antibody diversification in B cells. Previous studies revealed that timely acetylation of specific regions in the immunoglobulin (Ig) locus is crucial for proper orchestration of these processes. However, knowledge about epigenetic modifiers controlling acetylation during these processes is largely missing. We hypothesize that Class I histone deacetylases (HDACs), which are key in controlling chromatin acetylation, play crucial roles in proper regulation of these processes. Moreover, we hypothesize that deregulation of Class I HDACs leads to aberrant targeting of these processes, which in turn might lead to lymphomagenesis. The latter hypothesis is of particular interest, as Class I HDACs are targeted in cancer patients by several HDAC inhibitors. In addition, ongoing preclinical studies suggest that these drugs have potential application in other pathologies, such as inflammation, or neurodegenerative- and psychiatric diseases. In light of these clinical applications of HDAC inhibitors, it is of paramount importance to understand how specific HDACs contribute to normal biological processes, such as for example B cell development and antibody diversification. To investigate our hypotheses, we propose here an in depth study investigating the role of Class I HDACs in B cell development and antibody diversification processes. Our aim is to first perform phenotypical analysis, focussing on B cell development, V(D)J recombination, CSR and SHM. To do this we will use conditional murine knockout models in which we ablate Class I histone deacetylases either partly or completely in B cells. Initial phenotypical studies focussing on Hdac1 and Hdac2 already revealed highly interesting observations. We found that these enzymes play a role in controlling V(D)J recombination, Ig locus contraction, and the ratio of Ig light chain kappa versus lambda expressing B cells; these processes are dependent on the dosage of Hdac1 and Hdac2. Moreover, we found that these enzymes regulate the expression of hematopoietic stem cell markers as these remain expressed in early B cells. Detailed description of these phenotypes and potential new phenotypes will be accompanied by mechanistic studies, to understand the underlying molecular basis. This will use state of the art technology as available.Besides mechanistic studies we will examine if potential phenotypes related to the highly mutagenic antibody diversification processes might create a condition in which tumorigenesis can occur. For this, we will immunize our mouse models to induce CSR and SHM and monitor tumor development over time. These and other experiments described in this proposal should generate a complete understanding about Class I HDACs in B cell development and antibody diversification processes. Finally, this information will deepen our insights on how inhibition of Class I HDACs in leukemia or myeloma patients treated with HDAC inhibitors affects normal B cell function. Moreover, it might also contribute to decision making of which HDACs to target in disease and which should be spared because of possible unwanted side-effects.

We have preliminary data indicating that nuclear architecture and cell and nuclear mechanical properties change significantly with differentiation, and are further modulated by biophysical stimulation. We hypothesise that the nucleus as a mechanosensor in the biophysical regulation of stem cell fate. This project aims to determine the factors behind differentiation-induced alterations to the MSC mechano-phenotype. We will compare human MSCs with and without biophysical stimulation before and after differentiation to elucidate biomechanical, compositional and structural differences in nuclear architecture and the LINC (Linker of cytoskeleton and nucleoskeleton) complex which may modulate mechanosensitivity and cell mechanics. Analysis of nuclear strain transfer in conjunction with cytoskeletal and nuclear architecture modulation will enhance our understanding of mechanotransduction mechanisms within the cell. Quantitative proteomic analysis will characterise changes in cytoplasmic and nuclear composition with differentiation allowing us to identify potential targets responsible for the modulation of mechanosensitivity. Quantitative data on force transfer across the LINC complex from a nesprin force sensor will provide unique insights into how nuclear mechanoregulation changes with differentiation. Finally, characterisation of biophysically induced epigenetic alterations will identify the mechanisms through which repeated biophysical stimulation can instil an epigenetic mechanical memory within the nucleus.

Although significance achievements have been made in demonstrating the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in neuropsychiatric disorders, both in human patients and animal models, causal mechanistic links have yet to be established. In this regard, one of the pertinent problems has been lack of a longitudinal analysis of epigenetic changes from the time of induction by environmental factors to development of behavioral changes in adulthood. In our proposed project, we plan to tackle this hurdle by tagging epigenetic alterations as they are induced by adverse early life experiences for a retrospective analysis in adult mice, and directly correlating these changes with subsequent behavioral alterations. Another major question in the field relates to how several disease susceptibility loci spread across the genome are structurally and functionally connected in a manner that influences behavior. We will address this question by combining our retrospective tagging approach with high-throughput chromatin conformation analysis to identify short- and long-range chromatin interaction events in the mouse brain and how they are altered during development of maladaptive behavior. Taken together, the results of our studies will provide significant contribution to our understanding of development of neuropsychiatric disorders and will introduce a novel experimental approach and genome-scale epigenomics data for further exploitation.

Epigenetic processes, including DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications and chromatin remodeling, contribute to the pathogenesis of human cancers and impact on disease progression, treatment responses and clinical outcome. A large portion of the human genome encodes long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) including lncRNAs generated in intergenic regions and promoter-associated noncoding RNAs (paRNAs) adjacent to protein-coding genes. LncRNAs comprise an heterogeneous population of transcripts many of which likely exert important epigenetic regulatory functions. We have shown that promoter-proximal lncRNAs can establish and maintain the transcriptional silent and active states of genes in cancer cells. However, the extent and complexity of the potential RNA-based regulatory networks created by paRNAs and their involvement in human cancer are still to be defined. We hypothesize that RNA-based epigenetic regulatory networks might represent a widespread mechanism to control gene expression with a relevant impact on cancer development and progression. Furthermore, promoter-proximal lncRNAs controlling key cancer genes represent targetable elements of the epigenetic apparatus for therapeutic modulation of gene expression. Accordingly, the overall goal of this project is to define the role of promoter-proximal lncRNAs in controlling transcriptional silencing and activation of key cancer genes and the diverse mechanisms by which they exert these functions. We will focus initially on the novel mechanism of transcriptional regulation of the CDH1 tumor suppressor gene by bidirectional paRNAs that we have uncovered. In parallel, we will explore similar RNA-based networks in other genes using genome-wide approaches. We expect that this will lead to the identification of other relevant genes in prostate tumors similarly regulated and targetable by RNAi-based transcriptional approaches. To this end, we plan to analyze public Next Generation Sequencing databases containing RNA-seq data to identify promoter-associated transcripts in genes deregulated in prostate cancer and establish their relation with transcriptional gene silencing or activation. RNA-seq data will be validated experimentally by qRT-PCR in normal and cancer cell lines. Furthermore, normal and prostate tumor tissue samples will be examined to establish the relevance of these findings in clinical human samples. Our goal is to link specific patterns of sense and antisense paRNAs with promoter state and transcriptional activity of the genes. Analysis of clinical samples and human normal and prostate cancer cell lines representing different stages of the disease will provide additional hints of the role of the paRNAs and deregulated target genes in prostate tumorigenesis. We will include in the study also normal and cancer cells engineered to model over-expression and down-regulation of specific oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes to further link altered paRNA/gene expression patterns to the molecular and biological characteristics of prostate tumors.To understand the biological relevance of the identified paRNAs will perform knockdown experiments and evaluate the consequences on target gene expression. To uncover the mechanism by which paRNAs exert these function we will perform knockdown experiments along with additional functional assays, including RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), RNA-ChIP and biotin-labeled RNA pull-down. Promoter reporter and expression vectors will be generated as tools to further define the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by paRNAs. RNA sequencing experiments of nuclear RNA fraction will assist in the identification of small RNAs and microRNAs that might be involved in interactions of paRNAs with protein partners like Argonautes. Furthermore, we will test the hypothesis that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) mapping in non-coding regions and gene promoters might induce inter-individual and allele-specific differences in transcriptional activity of protein-coding genes by perturbing the epigenetic functions of paRNAs through modifications of their primary sequence and/or secondary structure. Finally, we will explore the potential of RNAi-based transcriptional modulation to affect the cancer cell phenotype. We will focus specifically on key genes whose modulation might affect preferentially stem-like and tumor-initiating properties of cancer cells and determine the effects of RNAi-mediated transcriptional silencing or activation in vitro and in vivo. Our genome-wide approach might discover new targets with potential important functions in tumor initiation and progression that will be tested using these approaches. Collectively, the studies will provide novel insights into fundamental biological mechanisms of gene regulation and the basis for development of novel therapeutic strategies.

This is in stark contrast to animals that must set aside a lineage of undifferentiated cells for reproduction (germ cells) and cannot naturally regenerate from body parts. Recent studies suggest that plant ge-nome plasticity may be supported by specific chromatin organization and composition. But the precise events and control mechanisms of large-scale chromatin remodeling and chromosome organization in reprogramming processes, as described above, are barely explored. 1.2Hypothesis (a) Sexual reproduction in plants involves double fertilization. The two female gametes are clo-nally derived in a multicellular structure but have distinct post-fertilization fates. We hypothesize that distinct epigenetic chromatin signatures are established early during gametogenesis to mark their cell fate. (b) Reproductive success relies on the endosperm, an extra-embryonic nurse tissue produced at fertilization. The dosage of paternally vs maternally-derived products is crucial for its devel-opment; alteration can result in seed abortion and hybridization failure. We discovered a specific heterochromatin fraction which responds to ploidy alterations in a parent-of-origin-dependent manner (Baroux et al, 2007). We hypothesize that parental dosage is mediated, in part, by genes regulated in this heterochromatin fraction.(c) During clonal propagation, somatic cells de-differentiate under appropriate stimuli and become totipotent. Progeny is produced via somatic embryogenesis or organogenesis. We hypo-thesize that this genome-wide reprogramming involves specific large-scale chromatin modifications.1.3Specific AimsTo answer the above questions, we will:(a) Identify gametic chromatin signatures and analyze their role in cell fate determination.(b) Investigate the role, control, and nature of endosperm-specific heterochromatin in parental dosage regulation and the hybridization barrier.(c) Describe the chromatin dynamics accompanying reprogramming in an experimental case of clonal propagation.1.4Experimental approach(a) Chromatin organization and dynamics will be described in developing gametophytes of Ara-bidopsis using whole-mount immunolabelling, FISH, and GFP-tagged proteins. Mutant analysis will uncover the role of candidate signatures. We will investigate the conservation of the signatures in rice. (b) Quantitative and qualitative alteration of the endosperm-specific heterochromatin in hybrids and mutants will uncover its significance and molecular control, respectively. The presence of candidate genes within this fraction will be tested by FISH. For (c) a simple experimental system is chosen where somatic embryos can be induced at high efficiency from Brassica microspores.1.5SignificanceThis research will significantly contribute to elucidating the mechanistic basis of the extraordinary plasticity of plant cells and the acquisition of cell fate. Understanding parental dosage control in nonviable vs viable hybrid seeds could potentially feed applications in hybrid plant production.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div.

One of the most common risks amphibian larvae face is pond drying, and they respond by accelerating development and metamorphosing early. There is a long history of the study of metamorphosis, both from an ecology and developmental biology perspective and thus, the developmental plasticity and environmental triggers as well as the endocrine signaling pathways involved are well known. Recent years have also seen an improved understanding of the genes involved, but nothing is known about how these are regulated. With this project, we will perform genome-wide scans to uncover regions involved in the epigenetic control of developmental plasticity. Using the highly developmentally plastic western spadefoot toad (Pelobates cultripes) as a model organism, we will experimentally induce early development through simulated pond drying and screen the genome for two known epigenetic mechanisms: nucleosome eviction and DNA methylation. We will use state-of-the-art techniques, namely FAIRE and MeDIP, coupled with high throughput sequencing.This project will be the first ever study on the epigenetic mechanisms controlling developmental plasticity in amphibians and the results of this project will give unprecedented insight into how vertebrates can flexibly regulate adaptive responses to perceived environmental risk. This has important greater implications for the general understanding of how functionally relevant changes are made to the genome without hard changes to the nucleotide sequences, an important area of research for understanding aging and disease.

Transformed cells, however, require support from the surrounding normal tissue (i.e. the tumor microenvironment) in order to progress to life-threatening invasive and metastatic cancers. Compared to normal quiescent tissue, the tumor microenvironment is characterized by profound changes in cellular composition, such as the appearance of cancer-associated fibroblasts, angiogenic blood and lymphatic endothelial cells, and the accumulation of many immune, inflammatory and bone marrow-derived cells (BMDC). Collectively these cells cooperate to promote tumor growth, invasion and metastatic spreading. Cell migration is key to many events of cancer progression: tumor cells acquire migratory and invasive capacities during transformation, migration is necessary for metastatic spreading, angiogenic endothelial cells migrate toward the growing tumors, and immune, inflammatory and BMD-cells migrate to primary tumors and metastatic sites. In this ProDoc research module we will address complementary topics of cancer research involving cell migration. With ProDoc Student 3 we will investigate mechanisms of breast cancer metastasis to the brain. We have recently established a model of spontaneous breast cancer metastasis to the brain in immunocompetent mice and identified clinically relevant genes that are functionally involved in this process. We will use this model to investigate how brain metastatic cells migrate across the blood-brain barrier, how the brain parenchyma modulates their invasive capacities once they have passed the blood-brain barrier, and whether BMDC contribute to breast cancer cell entry into the brain. A main focus of this module concerns the role of immune, inflammatory and BMDC in tumor progression. With ProDoc Student 4 we will study the role of TLR9-mediated activation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) on their ability to migrate into tumors. By analogy with dendritic cells, we are proposing that activation-induced maturation of MDSC may lead to changes in their homing and recirculation properties within the tumor-bearing host. A reduced recruitment of MDSC to the tumor microenvironment and draining lymph nodes is expected to impact on the anti-tumor immune response. This thesis will also investigate whether immune activation of MDSC might impinge on tumor metastasis. ProDoc Student 5 will investigate the role of endothelial Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) on the recruitment of BMDC into primary tumors and premetastatic niches. This project is based on the use of a transgenic mouse model for endothelial cell-specific Tetracycline-regulatable expression of human Ang-2 that we have recently established and characterized. In particular, we will characterize the effect of continuous and moderate increase of Ang-2 expression in endothelial cells on tumor vessel morphology and function, on the recruitment of BMDC and Tie-2 expressing monocytes (TEM) to primary and metastatic sites and on their contribution to tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. ProDoc Student 13 will investigate the role of endothelial cell-derived factors in promoting migration and invasion of adjacent tumor cells. We have previously observed that endothelial cell activation induces tumor cell motility, and by genome wide screenings we have identified candidate molecules promoting tumor cell migration. Here we will characterize the effect of some of these factors and their receptors. With ProDoc Student 14 we will use an orthotopic model for pancreas cancer to study the effect of innate immune activation on the migration of tumor-specific effector CD8 T cells to tumors and to identify strategies to enhance their recruitment in order to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy. Taken together, in this ProDoc module we will address important aspects of tumor cell, BMDC, immune, and inflammatory cell migration in cancer progression through five coordinated and integrated projects. Interactions across all partner laboratories are essential for each of these projects and are naturally based on the specific backgrounds and expertises of the collaborating groups. Interactions include the shared use of unique experimental models, the investigation of similar or related phenomena in different models and the integration of results across projects to generate novel hypotheses. Considering the important biomedical and clinical relevance of the projects pursued in this module, we will attempt, whenever possible, to rapidly validate experimental results with observations on human material.

The search for genes implicated in the genesis of SZ have identified multiple candidates, in support of a polygenic nature of the disorder that affects the functioning of entire brain circuits. These findings also suggest that SZ might arise from global disturbances of circuits, most likely generated by defective neurotransmission. Among current theories of schizophrenia, the DA hypothesis is most credited as pharmacological and imaging evidences revealed altered brain DA levels in affected patients. In addition, antipsychotic drugs used for the treatment of psychotic symptoms in SZ are all, to some degree, antagonists of dopamine D2 receptors (D2R). However, while it was postulated that excessive DA in the brain might cause SZ, recent notions hypothesize excessive DA transmission in subcortical areas (striatum) and a DA deficit in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). This scenario, while explaining why antipsychotics have beneficial effects on positive but not negative SZ symptoms, calls also for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms leading to SZ in order to improve the pharmacological treatment of this disorder. Thus, an animal model with dysfunctional DA levels might constitute a valid and novel approach to study SZ and the cellular, molecular and behavioral circuits involved. The laboratory of Prof. E. Borrelli has generated such a model by selectively removing the DA D2 autoreceptors from the DA neurons of the midbrain (DA-D2RKO mice). They previously showed that in these mice the DA-mediated inhibition of DA synthesis and release is absent. Importantly, DA-D2RKO mice are hyperactive and have a higher response to amphetamines due to higher DA levels in the striatum. On the contrary, when compared to control mice, they show a deficit of DA signaling in the PFC as illustrated by working memory and prepulse inhibition (PPI) impairments. These results show that removing the D2 autoreceptor from DA neurons differentially affects DA levels in striatum and PFC and generate mice with a “psychotic” phenotype. Thus, it appears that DA-D2RKO mice are a valid model system to analyze the DA hypothesis of SZ. Indeed, the receiving laboratory has experimental evidence showing that hyperactivity (a sign of striatal hyperdopaminergia) is reversed by antipsychotic treatment (haloperidol, clozapine), while PFC deficits (caused by hypo-dopaminergia) can be reverted using a D2-specific agonist (quinpirole) but not by D2R antagonists. Importantly, they recently discovered that the behavioral phenotype of DA-D2RKO mice is associated with a major epigenetic reprogramming of gene expression selective for the PFC. This suggests that a deficient control of DA release leads to maladaptation with a consequent global modification of the genome of PFC neurons. Using these mice, we plan on: 1) identifying the developmental timing during which the reprogramming of PFC neurons takes place; 2a) analyze the consequences of altered DA levels on the metabolism of cortical neurons; and 2b) identify the epigenetic mechanisms that lead to the down-regulation of the PFC-specific genes in DA-D2RKO mice. These two points are critical since to date very little is known on both the developmental effect of altered DA levels on PFC neurons and the metabolic changes occurring in PFC neurons in response to a deficient DA signaling. The experiments proposed will uncover yet unidentified aspects linking endogenous DA signaling, epigenetic modifications of the genome and metabolic properties of cortical neurons. This contribution is significant because is the first step toward the identification of the consequences of altered DA levels, of the time frame of appearance of PFC modification and of the metabolites and genes responsible for these modifications. This might lead to the development of novel pharmacological strategies that will go beyond the antagonisms of DA receptors and hopefully increase their efficacy on the positive and negative symptoms of SZ while diminishing the side effects of these therapies. Furthermore, the possibility to identify the first genes targeted by altered DA levels during the postnatal development might generate new leads for future research and treatment of psychosis at the time of appearance. Thus, important advances are expected from these studies in the therapy of neuropsychiatric disorders involving DAergic dysfunctions.

They are generally considered as intra-chromosomal parasites. However, their periodical activity bursts influenced organization of host genomes and contributed to beneficial traits. Remarkably, number of transposon generated phenotypic innovations was subsequently selected by humans during plant domestication and breeding. Therefore, retrotransposons could be also considered as attractive endogenous source of genetic variation. Unfortunately so far there is no experimental/technological means to exploit this potential in a controlled fashion. Recently my laboratory revealed surprisingly selective epigenetic, environmental and developmental mechanisms controlling retrotransposition in Arabidopsis. Here, I intend to build on this knowledge and establish well controlled retrotransposition system a crop plant to liberate its innate genetic diversity buried in silenced TEs. To achieve this, I propose a stepwise strategy with the following three objectives: 1. Deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms and environmental cues controlling retrotransposition in Arabidopsis thaliana and use this model plant to develop universal methodology for detection of retrotransposition. 2. Transfer the knowledge and methodologies to non model plant. I propose to use Arabidopsis lyrata as close relative of A. thaliana, however with 50% enlarged genome due to expansion of retrotransposon populations. 3. Using methodologies and experimental conditions developed for A. thaliana and A. lyrata we will apply them to maize where we can also take advantage of genetic resources (mutants in epigenetic regulation) in conjunction with responses to selected abiotic stresses. If the progress towards above listed objectives was swift, I will initiate collaboration with a corn breeding company to create EVOBREED generated population for evaluation of its phenotypic diversity.

We have recently shown that synovial fibroblasts (SF) from different joint localizations exhibit profound differences in their expression patterns, which translate into a joint specific enrichment of arthritis relevant pathways, molecules and joint specific functional differences of SF. We think that this positional identity, which is independent of an inflammatory stimulus, predisposes specific joints for diverse types of arthritis. Epigenetic mechanisms underlying the positional identity of SF are currently under investigation in our laboratory. In the outlined project, we focus on the potential role of the bromodomain proteins CREBBP and p300, which have epigenetic reader and writer function, in maintaining joint specific expression signatures of SF by regulating the expression of genes encoded in the HOX loci, or by serving as cofactors of HOX transcription factors. Furthermore, we address the role of CREBBP and p300 in SF under inflammatory conditions. With the outlined project we get a detailed picture of the therapeutic potential of a specific CREBBP and p300 protein inhibition in joint resident SF in arthritis and will obtain new insights in the epigenetic regulation of key molecules maintaining the joint specific memory of SF as well as in the epigenetic regulation of genes involved in an inflammatory response.

Emerging evidence has suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of non-coding RNAs implicated in gene silencing via translational repression or mRNA degradation, can function as potent memory regulators. The biogenesis and functions of miRNAs are complex processes that implicate multiple steps. Some of these steps are thought to depend on protein kinases and phosphatases but the role of these enzymes in miRNAs biogenesis remain undefined. Based on our previous findings that protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is a strong memory suppressor that modulates transcriptional programs, we recently conducted pilot experiments that revealed that the expression of some miRNAs is altered by PP1 inhibition in adult transgenic mice, and that the same miRNAs are similarly affected following learning in control mice. These preliminary results led us to postulate that PP1 is a critical regulator of miRNAs during memory formation. This project will examine this possibility and 1) identify the miRNAs whose biogenesis is controlled by PP1 in the adult mouse brain, and which are implicated in memory formation, 2) examine the mechanisms by which PP1 regulates the expression of these miRNAs, 3) functionally validate their role in memory formation, and 4) examine if they are associated with age-related memory loss. The results of this project are expected to provide novel and unprecedented knowledge about the contribution of miRNAs to the epigenetic regulation of memory and about their mechanisms of control. They should be of considerable value for a better understanding of the biological processes that depend on miRNAs in health and disease.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div.

Prevention of colorectal cancer has been greatly facilitated by the introduction of colonoscopy, which allows direct inspection of the gut’s epithelial lining and removal of any precancerous lesions that might be present. Ongoing advances in endoscopic technology, technique, and operator training have markedly reduced the incidence of colon cancers-at least in the distal colon. The more limited success achieved in the prevention of proximal colon cancers has been attributed in part to the higher prevalence in this portion of the large bowel of “flat” precancerous lesions, which develop laterally rather than protruding into the gut lumen like classical colon polyps. These lesions are not only more difficult to identify and excise during endoscopy: they are also more likely to be erroneously dismissed by pathologists as lesions with no malignant potential, and the patients harboring them followed with a relatively relaxed schedule of colonoscopic surveillance. The error can have grave consequences because flat lesions of this kind are typical of the recently recognized serrated pathway to colorectal cancer, and the subtype known as sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (SSA/Ps) are the putative precursors of a subset of proximal colon cancers characterized by the CpG-island methylator phenotype (CIMP) and defective DNA mismatch repair (MMR). CIMP is an epigenetic disorder of unknown origin, which can inactivate the transcription of tumor suppressors and other key genes by causing cytosine methylation in promoter CpG islands. Silencing of the MMR gene MLH1-a major CIMP target- occurs during the adenoma-carcinoma transition and leads to a typical DNA mutator phenotype. CIMP-positive / MMR-deficient colon cancers are sporadic (i.e., not inherited) and more common in older individuals, women in particular. They represent ~10% of all colorectal cancers and roughly one out of four of those in the proximal colon.If SSA/Ps are indeed the precursors of these cancers, proximal-colon SSA/Ps probably have features that facilitate this specific line of progression and distinguish them from their counterparts in the distal colon. The project described in this application is designed to test the hypothesis that the difference between proximal- and distal-colon SSA/Ps lies in their levels of CpG-island methylation. To this end, preinvasive colon lesions with sessile and nonpolypoid morphologies (typical of SSA/Ps) endoscopically removed from 200 women will be subjected to targeted multiplex bisulfite DNA sequencing to detect epigenetic and genetic alterations at 48 genomic loci, including 46 that have recently been identified by the PI’s group as likely targets of the “proto-CIMP” suspected to characterize proximal SSA/Ps. The results will be refined in light of the results of high-throughput assessment of cytosine methylation and gene expression studies conducted with lesional DNA and RNA from selected proximal- and distal-colon SSA/Ps. This two-pronged approach should allow us to identify and validate a small number of methylated promoters and genes with altered expression, whose combined, multiplexed analysis might be developed into a simple molecular assay for pinpointing precancerous proximal-colon lesions that are the actual precursors of CIMP positive / MMR-deficient cancers. Molecular-based identification of lesions of this type removed during colonoscopy will allow clinicians to prescribe more rational, cost-effective endoscopic surveillance. In addition, our genome-wide analysis of these precancerous lesions-in the absence of the “noise” caused by the myriad cancer-associated genetic alterations that occur later (MMR deficiency in particular)-should provide potential clues to the underlying causes of CIMP in colon tumorigenesis.

Here, I propose to employ an intestinal organoid system to study how dietary factors, gut-modified secondary metabolites, and individual gut-resident bacteria can reshape intestinal cells and how the use of nuclear receptor ligands modulates this response. I will focus in particular on nuclear receptor signaling networks and affiliated transcriptional and epigenetic programs (the main focus being on FXR), as they are amenable to therapeutic interventions and are already heavily implicated in the etiology of colorectal cancer. In this context the intestinal organoid system is particularly interest because it closely recapitulates the development, structure and cellular composition of the gut epithelium, and allows screening and mechanistic studies involving the physiological interplay between the gut epithelium, environmental cues and nuclear receptors.

For instance, in plants, organ formation can be generally divided into a phase of primordium formation and patterning accompanied by cell proliferation, followed by organ growth caused primarily by cell expansion. This coordination between cell proliferation and cell expansion relies to a substantial extent on systemic cues, often in form of hormone ratios. These cues must be ultimately interpreted by individual cells to effect cell division, differentiation and expansion (Leyser & Day, 2003) (Quentin & Cronk, 2009). A poorly understood process, particularly in plants, is how cells locally coordinate their behaviour. In addition to small molecules such as hormones, plant cells can communicate by exchanging regulatory proteins. In addition, it has recently been suggested that the intercellular transfer of microRNAs (miRNAs) contributes to patterning as well (Chitwood et al, 2009) (Carlsbecker et al, 2010) (Dunoyer et al, 2010) (Molnar et al, 2010). miRNAs are short non-coding RNA molecules, between 19-24 nucleotide long, that can directly silence endogenous genes at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. Animal miRNAs mainly act as inhibitors of translation of a large number of targets with limited sequence complementarity. In contrast, plant miRNAs appear to be much more selective, with high complementarity to the target mRNA, often causing mRNA cleavage (Voinnet, 2009). Several of the major families of conserved plant miRNAs have been implicated in leaf morphogenesis: miR319, miR159, miR164, miR396 (Palatnik et al, 2003) (Palatnik et al, 2007) (Nikovics et al, 2006) (Rodriguez et al, 2010). All four target different transcription factor families, making them attractive as a basis for the study leaf development. This is the more true as several miRNAs respond both to changes in hormone levels and to control regulators of leaf morphogenesis. With this proposal, I aim to dissect the contribution of several interacting miRNAs to leaf morphogenesis. Objectives and specific aims:My overall goal is to increase our knowledge of how leaves are made and shaped, because leaves, with their ability to photosynthesize, play a fundamental role in natural and agricultural productivity. The ideal plant for the type of genetic and genomic approaches I propose to take is the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. Because flowering plants including all crops share a recent evolutionary history, many of the insights gained from studying Arabidopsis thaliana can be easily transferred to our species. My specific aims are:1-Identify landmark events in leaf morphogenesis2-Identify by forward genetics new miRNA-related leaf regulators3-Identify direct targets of miRNA-controlled transcription factors regulating leaf development and generate an atlas of chromatin modification and gene expression profiles in the expression domains of the leaf regulatory miRNAs4-Integrate morphological, expression and epigenetic data	Swiss National Science Foundation	Fellowships for prospective researchers	None	None

Maternal hypoxemia, reduction in umbilical blood flow or placental dysfunction can rapidly lead to acute or chronic ischemia and/or hypoxia at the level of the developing organism. This project aims to establish a mechanistic basis of how the adenosine molecule produced by hypoxia and considered as a pivotal regulator of the developing cardiovascular system, reversibly or irreversibly, modifies cardiac activity in the embryo. We propose to investigate the effects of stimulation of specific adenosine receptors on cardiac function, signaling pathways, glycogen metabolism and regulation of selected target genes. Furthermore, we want to know whether a transient hypoxia in the course of early cardiogenesis render the developing heart more vulnerable to a subsequent anoxia-reoxygenation and to what extent adenosine signaling is involved.Experimental design and methods.The experimental model is the intact and spontaneously beating heart isolated from 4-day-old chick embryos. Fertilized eggs will be exposed either to steady normoxia (21% O2, NORM group) or to transient hypoxia (10%O2, HYP group) between day 2 and 3. After the 4 days of in ovo development, cardiac hemodynamic parameters will be determined in situ using a computerized high speed camera and then the hearts will be mounted in a culture chamber and submitted to strictly controlled anoxia (30-60 min) and reoxygenation (60-120min). The chrono-, dromo- and inotropic effects of specific modulators of the A1, A2a, A2b and A3 adenosine receptors will be determined in vitro from ECG and myocardial contractility continuously recorded under normoxia and during anoxia-reoxygenation. The time-dependent adenosine-mediated phosphorylation of ERK, p38MAPK, STAT3, PI3K, Akt and GSK3ß will be determined in atria, ventricle and outflow tract in NORM and HYP groups. With respect to their pivotal role in controlling the level of protein phosphorylation, the possibility that protein phosphatases PP2A and PP1 modulate signaling cascades and cardiac function will be investigated using specific inhibitors. As glycogen concentration is remarkably high in the embryonic heart and plays a central role in energy metabolism and protection against adverse conditions, its control by the adenosinergic system via the PI3K-Akt-GSK3ß pathway will be investigated. To what extent activation of NOS and NADPH oxidase by adenosine affords cardioprotection deserves to be explored, inasmuch as hypoxia is a potent stimulus for iNOS gene activation. Upregulation of this gene will be also investigated. Expected value of the proposed project.The expected results should provide complementary data to better understand the cellular mechanisms underlying the adaptative response of the developing heart to an adverse hypoxic environment, especially during a critical period of heart morphogenesis. Furthermore, this study addresses the important question of epigenetic regulation of gene expression.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div. I-III)	250000.0	CHF

Perturbations of this delicate balance can lead to obesity, a current world wide epidemic affecting 11% of population that could reach 1 billion people by 2030 (World Health Organization). This is aggravated by the fact that obesity leads to other associated pathologies such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NFALD) and some type of cancers. RATIONALE: Obesity treatments including drugs targeting energy intake or bariatric surgery have revealed inefficacious or leading to adverse side effects. Recent advances have identified the presence of functional brown adipose tissue in adult humans, a specialized thermogenic tissue that dissipates excess of energy into heat through uncoupling mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Interestingly, the current research strives now to identify pathways that increase energy expenditure through brown adipose tissue thermogenesis as an alternative therapeutic approach. Despite extensive research and recent advances, how the genetic, cellular and molecular factors shape the regulation of thermogenesis remains still partially understood. My most recent research has shown that the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) recruits the thermogenic co-activator Peroxisome Proliferator Activator Receptor-1 alpha (PGC-1a) and promotes mitochondrial and thermogenic function. In addition, preliminary data show that YY1 in brown adipose tissue is acetylated in response to high energetic demand through adrenergic signaling.OBJECTIVE: The main goal of my current research is to understand how the excess of dietary nutrients or energy related environmental stimuli modulate the chromatin and epigenetic landscape that in turn affect the transcriptional regulation of energy expenditure. We hypothesize that YY1-specific post-translational modifications and the recruitment of specific chromatin factors could play a sensing role of environmental stimuli to coordinate a thermogenic response in brown adipose tissue. To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will identify the physiological and thermogenic role of YY1 acetylation in brown adipose tissue. Then, in order to understand the mechanistic role of YY1 transcriptional complex in the recruitment of chromatin associated cofactors, Aim 2 will identify novel factors including acetyltransferases and deacetylases that interact with YY1 in response to high energetic demand. The recruitment of chromatin factors by YY1 shapes the epigenetic landscape of YY1 targets. Aim 3 will identify genome-wide specific histone modifications and YY1 occupancy in response to nutritional stimuli in mouse and human adipose tissue. In summary, novel transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory pathways in response to variations in the energetic/nutritional status will be identified using state-of-the-art proteomic and genomic methods. This will reveal potential novel druggable molecular targets which have a significance in obesity and metabolic disorders.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div. I-III)	609018.0	CHF

One of the difficulties arises from the observation that genes can often be so large, with remote and complex regulatory elements, that it is becomes technically difficult to perform a functional dissection within their native chromosomal context. The experiments described in the present proposal are addressing this question. As a model system, we study the regulation of the homeotic genes (Hox genes) of the bithorax complex (BX-C) in Drosophila. The homeotic genes are strikingly conserved between invertebrates and vertebrates. The genes are found in clusters or 'complexes' and are arranged on the chromosome in the order of their function along the anteroposterior body axis (AP-axis). This striking correspondence between genomic organization and antero-posterior axis gives us a unique opportunity to study gene regulation in its chromosomal context. Another unique opportunity offered by the BX-C is the wealth of available genetic data that makes its one of the best characterized complex locus in higher eukaryotes. We previously identified a number of regulatory elements; these include enhancers able to sense their position along the AP axis, tissue-specific enhancers, and regulatory elements able to convey epigenetic maintenance of the state of activity of the hox genes, (the so-called Polycomb/trithoraxi-Response-Elements). We also identified particular regulatory elements that function as chromatin domain boundaries and that play fundamental roles in the sequential activation of the homeotic genes. We propose to analyse how the respective activities of these different regulatory elements are coordinated to generate the appropriate output signal that will regulate proper Abd-B expression and specify segment identity. To this aim we use site-specific recombination tools that we have developed during the last funding period of this proposal to systematically dissect the regulatory regions within their native chromosomal context. We pay special attention on the role that non-coding transcripts from the regulatory regions may play in the transmission (in cis or in trans) of a signal between the enhancers and the promoters or whether they may play a role in the coordinating the activities of the various types of regulatory elements. We recently found that Abd-B is expressed in the male accessory gland. The male accessory gland is the site of synthesis of numerous Accessory-Gland-Specific-Proteins (Acps; more than 100 are identified) that elicit several post-mating behaviours in females, once they have been fertilized. We propose to identify which of these post-mating behaviours is controlled by Abd-B.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div. I-III)	380210.0	CHF

The isolation of mutants with a notched wing started the molecular identification and characterization of the Notch transmembrane receptor in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. In consequence, an apparently simple signal transduction mechanism was unraveled: Activation of Notch upon ligand binding results in its proteolytic cleavage and in the release of the Notch intracellular domain, which engages in transcriptional regulation. A number of Notch-interacting components have been identified in the meanwhile pinpointing to a complicated circuitry regulating Notch pathway activity, which is only poorly understood. Also in humans, Notch has a similarly important function in the control of cellular differentiation and stem cell formation, and its decisive role in a variety of human diseases including cancer is well established.Despite the biological importance of the Notch pathway and its increasing significance for medical research, single candidate approaches and labor intense genetic screens still dominate the attempts to identify the pathway components and to understand their interconnections. In this regard, systems biology can facilitate the identification of potential pathway components at a large and comprehensive scale. We have started such an approach by describing a first set of 353 validated novel Notch regulators we identified with a combination of high-throughput whole-genome ex vivo and in vivo RNAi screening techniques, and network analyses. With this data basis, and by the inclusion of new technologies and ideas, we plan to expand this Notch interaction network substantially and to link the Notch signaling cascade to selective target gene expression and growth control.To this end, we plan to examine the data obtained from the ex vivo RNAi screen with new computational tools to identify so far undetected Notch regulators. In parallel, our screening data and the initial network will serve as basis to establish a high-density protein-protein interaction landscape for the Notch signaling pathway by tandem affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (AP-MS), with the identified Notch pathway components being the baits and RNAi serving as in vivo validation tool. This analysis will be performed in collaboration with the laboratory of Professor Ruedi Aebersold (ETHZ, Switzerland). Mass spectrometry analyses will also be used to identify changes in post-translational modifications and in the abundance of Notch pathway components upon Notch activation (selective reaction monitoring, SRM), providing valuable insights into network dynamics. The obtained data sets will be complemented by in-depth analyses of the epigenetic gene regulators of the Polycomb-Trithorax groups (PcG-TrxG) of proteins, which we have identified as Notch regulators and which play important roles in cancer. Genome-wide binding profiles for the PcG-TrxG and other nuclear components of the Notch pathway will be determined before and after Notch activation in different cell types by chromatin immunoprecipitations coupled with massive parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq). The analysis of the obtained data will enable us to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying the cell-type specific activation of Notch target genes and the role of Notch in growth control. Finally, we will combine all data in one comprehensive interaction network.In light of the evolutionary conservation of the pathway, our results will provide a unique resource for Notch-related and medical research in all animal models, and will allow us to model the pathway and its regulation in collaboration with computational biologists in the human system. This long-term goal can be expected to have a substantial impact on the exploitation of the Notch pathway for human tissue engineering and disease treatment.

Klinisch-Biologische Wissenschaften Universität Basel	2010-03-01	2015-02-28	Polycomb complex-mediated and epigenetic regulation of thymic epithelial cell development: an integrative genomic analysis	Background: The thymus provides the physiological microenvironment for the development of the majority of T lymphocytes. Its role is critical for the successful establishment and maintenance of the immune system's capacity to distinguish between vital “Self” and injurious “Non-Self”. This vital function is primarily instructed by thymic epithelial cells (TECs). Throughout life, terminally differentiated thymic cortical and medullary epithelia are replaced at a relatively high rate calling for the intra-thymic existence of a pool of precursor cells responsible for this continuous TEC turnover. However, neither the nature of the intrathymic stem/precursor cell nor the molecular mechanisms responsible for thymic organogenesis and the life-long homeostatic TEC maintenance are at present known in detail. Using integrative functional genomic analyses, the proposed research seeks to identify the molecular features that characterise thymic epithelial progenitor cells and that govern thymic tissue formation and preservation. Specifically, the chromatin modifying components Ring1A/B of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) and the function of the transcription factor Oct4 will be investigated for their role in TEC precursor biology and the phenomenon of de-differentiation of adult, respectively. Working Hypotheses: The current grant application is based on the testable hypotheses that(i)genes targeted by Ring1A/B are essential for TEC progenitor cell survival and the regular formation of their progeny; (ii) Oct4 driven de-differentiation of adult TECs to TEC precursors is dependent on the presence of Ring1A/B but can be rendered more efficiently by the absence of p53.(iii) Oct4 driven de-differentiation of adult TECs correlates with changes in histone marks, DNA methylation and microRNA expression providing insight into the mechanisms operational in TEC reprogramming.Specific Aims:#1: To determine the gene targets of Ring1A/B-mediated PRC1 function in progenitor and terminally differentiated TEC.#2: To investigate whether the effect of ectopic Oct4 expression on TEC dedifferentiation is dependent on the concomitant function of Ring1A and/or Ring1B and whether the absence of p53 impacts on the effect of Oct4.#3: To establish the gene expression profile and the epigenetic changes in TEC de-differentiation following Oct4 expression..Experimental Design and Methods:Novel transgenic mouse models combined with state of the art methods in molecular, cellular and computational biology will be used to address specific questions related to the genetic and epigenetic circuitry operational in gaining and maintaining TEC “stemness” and in the control of their differentiation. Expected Value of the Proposed ProjectInsight gained from the proposed studies will be important to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for the formation, homeostatic maintenance as well as the differentiation of thymic epithelial stem/precursor cells. This knowledge will be required to establish rational strategies for the (re)generation of functional thymic tissue to be used in specific cell therapy . These aspects are of particular relevance given the promise of embryonic stem cells (ESC) and somatic cells induced to a pluripotent state (i.e. iPS) to be utilized as a cellular source to restore thymic functions in the aged, in clinical situations of iatrogenic thymic hypoplasia/dysplasia, and in instances of congenital athymia, respectively.Keywords: Thymus organogenesis, functional genomics, epigenetics, Polycomb group proteins Ring-1A/B, Oct4, p53, thymus epithelial stem/precursor cells, (de-)differentiation,	Swiss National Science Foundation	NRP 63 Stem cells and regenerative medicine	567816.0	CHF

This heterogeneity results in inconsistent and unpredictable therapeutic response. Large genomic studies have allowed a comprehensive exploration of the genetic and epigenetic bases of cancer. However, the quantity and variety of modifications observed severely challenge the identification of the few events that are functional and ultimately can be targeted for therapy. Finally, cancer phenotypes are determined by more than one functional event acting in concert, and these genetic contexts determine prognosis and treatment response. The overall goal of this project is to identify functional and actionable sets of molecular alterations, here termed signatures, to design therapeutic protocols matching drug combinations with genetically defined tumor classes.The proposed research builds on computational biology and cancer genomics work from our group [1, 2, 3] and the largest collection of cancer genomes from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) including 11144 tumors from 33 cancer types. This dataset has been only recently finalized and as a group leader in the consortium, we are in a unique position to access this data and successfully pursue the proposed goals. The project’s aims are:AIM 1: From thousands of molecular alterations to selected functional events in cancer. Here, we will distill a set of selected functional events integrating genetic and epigenetic modifications. We will complement analyses of copy number changes and mutations with a novel approach to determine aberrant patterns of DNA methylation. Finally, we will integrate multiple types of events to identify signatures of alterations characteristic of tumor subclasses and reflecting distinct oncogenic mechanisms (oncogenic signatures). AIM 2: From oncogenic selected events to therapeutically actionable targets. Here, we will classify genetic and epigenetic events as therapeutically actionable and/or response-associated to selected drug compounds. We will integrate this classification into the context of signatures to map clinically relevant events with single or drug combinations in well characterized molecular contexts. This approach will ultimately generate hypotheses testable in the laboratory.AIM 3: From therapeutic targets to actionable signatures: a new paradigm to harness tumor interdependencies. Here, we will identify human tumor subclasses characterized by signatures of clinically relevant events. We will analyze these classes at different levels of granularity to account for functionally similar alterations and compounds. We will nominate actionable signatures predictive of drug response in specific genetic contexts and establish a framework for pre-clinical therapeutic studies. Results from this project will demonstrate the potential of combining systematic analyses based on actionable alterations across large tumor cohorts to design therapeutic protocols tailored to specific patient populations.

It is essential to link basic scientific discoveries with the arena of clinical investigation, especially in hemato-oncology. After the Bosnian war, there has been a significant increase in patients with blood cancers, thus, there is an urgent need to investigate and characterize hematological cancers in Bosnia. Currently, no translational research is done in the field of hematological malignancies in Bosnia. The infrastructure to perform translational biomedical research in this field is lacking, but the trained researchers and personnel are available. With a doctorate from the Institute for Molecular Pathology (IMP) in Vienna and post-doctoral training in molecular Hematology-Oncology at the Cleveland Clinic (Ohio, USA), Dr. Amina Kozaric, assistant professor of biomedical sciences, is a young female researcher who brings all the qualifications to initiate and run a laboratory focusing on translational research in hemato-oncology. The interest of both, the Bosnian and Swiss partner, are focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive the onset and progression of human blood cancers with a goal of developing and functionally validating novel therapeutic strategies. Our focus will be on mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-fusion leukemias, which are a subset of acute leukemias with very poor prognosis under current therapy protocols. There is a high scientific interest in this field because MLL leukemias have unique clinical and biological characteristics. Interestingly, leukemias with MLL rearrangements are mostly driven through dysregulation of a transforming gene expression program, making it a unique epigenetic model of leukemia. This project has a holistic approach to understanding MLL leukemia because it addresses three issues from different angles: (1) comprehension of epigenetic mechanism of leukemogenesis, (2) finding novel genes for therapeutic intervention, and (3) using novel inhibitors to test leukemic murine and human samples. The short-term goal of this research project is to establish a translational hemato-oncology laboratory by setting up the infrastructure needed to collect and bank blood cancer samples for molecular, genetic and pharmacological studies. The long-term goal of this project is sustainable development of a translational laboratory that (a) produces and advances knowledge on genetic and environmental risk factors in hematological malignancies; (b) improves clinical practice by developing potential new drugs; (c) serves as a resource to other researchers from Bosnia and abroad to collaborate and develop new projects aimed at improving patient care; (d) trains next-generation scientists in translational medical research in Bosnia. Our project is a primary milestone and gateway for introduction of translational research in a developing country like Bosnia. Setting up of modern laboratory for translational hemato-oncology will start a new era of Bosnian medical research. Sample collection and storage will be the platform for building up new and continuing cancer research in this country. The laboratory led by Dr. Kozaric will be the first to carry out this type of research in Bosnia, and in collaboration with the group of Prof. Schwaller, will explore the molecular and genetic aspects of hematological neoplasms like MLL acute leukemia.

1158	Jürg Schwaller	University of Basel	Departement Forschung Universitätsspital Basel	2010-04-01	2013-09-30	Functional dissection of molecular mechanisms and cellular targets of MLL Leukemia	Background: Most cases of infant acute leukemia (<1 year) and a significant fraction of cases of childhood as well as de novo or therapy-related adult acute leukemia are closely associated with translocations involving the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL1) gene leading to expression of fusion genes involving over 50 partners. The presence of an MLL fusion is a strong negative prognostic marker that not only underlines a direct role in the disease pathogenesis but also suggests that this pathway might harbor currently unknown molecular therapeutic targets. The most common MLL-alterations are t(11;19), t(4;11), and t(9;11) leading to expression of MLL-ENL, MLL-AF4 and MLL-AF9 fusions respectively. Expression of MLL-fusion genes in hematopoietic progenitor cells seems to provide aberrant self-renewal capacity in vitro and in vivo. Gene expression profiling studies revealed deregulation of potentially important downstream mediators like the HOX-A cluster of transcription factors in human and murine MLL rearrangement leukemia defining the mouse as an ideal model to study pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets. First genome-wide chromatin analysis demonstrated a distinct pattern of chromatin modifications in human and mouse MLL-AF4 acute leukemia suggesting that MLL leukemia might be the consequence of a defective “histone code”. MLL acute leukemia is characterized by relative chemoresistance and early relapse. Mimicking the effects of current chemotherapy in a mouse model suggested that MLL-leukemia might escape by impairing cellular sensing of DNA damage, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Working hypothesis: New conditional mouse models of the most prevalent leukemogenic MLL fusions will allow us to dissect critical cellular and molecular targets to potentially derive new therapeutic approaches. Aims: 1. To establish and functionally characterize three novel inducible transgenic mouse models of the most prevalent MLL-fusions.2. To identify and compare the cellular and molecular targets of these MLL-fusion proteins.3. To dissect the role of the transcriptional elongation machinery and chromatin modifying epigenetic factors in MLL-leukemia.4. To identify and validate potentially drugable protein kinase targets in MLL leukemia.5. To study molecular mechanisms of relative “chemoresistance” of MLL acute leukemia.Cellular and molecular targets identified in the murine model will be validated human cell lines and in primary leukemia samples, and assessed for their potential as prognostic/predictive biomarkers or for new therapeutic approaches. Significance: Despite the rapid development of new molecular tools that have helped to improve diagnosis and therapy, acute leukemia remains still a deadly disease for most of the patients in particular for individuals with distinct genetic alterations such as MLL fusion genes. This integrative in vitro and in vivo genomic and epigenetic experimental approach to unravel the overlapping molecular mechanisms of induction, maintenance and potential reversibility of MLL acute leukemia might open new avenues for targeted therapeutic intervention for a disease that is currently deleterious in most cases.

SUMMARY OF THE RESEARCH PLAN (max. 1 page)Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are a group of diseases characterized by aberrant proliferation of the erythroid, megakaryocytic and myeloid lineages. They represent clonal disorders of the hematopoietic stem cell with an inherent tendency towards leukemic transformation. MPN are subdivided into three disease entities: polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Somatic gain of function mutations in the genes JAK2, CALR, or MPL can be detected in blood cells of close to 90% of MPN patients. These gene mutations are known to act as drivers that can cause MPN phenotypes in patients and mouse models. MPN is a clonal disease of the hematopoietic stem cells. Disease manifestation and prognosis is in part influenced by additional somatic mutation that synergize with the driver mutations, but alone do not cause disease. These additional mutations most frequently occur in genes encoding epigenetic regulators, such as TET2, DNMT3a or EZH2. JAK2-V617F is the most frequent driver gene mutation occurring in 70-80% of MPN patients. Why some patients with JAK2-V617F, develop ET while others manifest as PV remains an open question. In contrast, JAK2 exon 12 mutations are tightly associated with PV and in many cases present as pure erythrocytosis. Both types of JAK2 mutations signal through the same C-terminal tyrosine kinase of JAK2, but result in very different phenotypic readouts. Furthermore, various knockin and transgenic mouse models of JAK2-V617F substantially differ in phenotypes, despite existing on the same genetically defined inbred background. We derived hypotheses and found factors that are likely to influence the phenotypic expression of MPN, which we will study in this proposal. We also derived preliminary data suggesting that the MPN hematopoietic stem cells are profoundly altered in their metabolism. Finally, we identified potential target genes that mediate the synergistic effects of JAK2-V617F and the loss of the epigenetic regulator EZH2. The proposed experiments will address the following specific aims:1. To examine genotype-phenotype correlations in MPN and define factors that determine ET versus PV phenotypes in MPN with mutated JAK2.2. To characterize altered characteristics of MPN stem cells, in particular the changes in transcriptome, metabolism, autophagy and lysosomal integrity.3. To study synergism between JAK2-V617F and mutations in epigenetic regulators in MPN pathogenesis and functionally test and validate candidate targets that mediate loss of Ezh2 in MPN.Significance: Our studies address important unsolved questions in the pathogenesis of MPN. We aim to test new hypotheses that may explain why one mutation (JAK2-V617F) can manifest as different clinical entities (ET or PV) with large inter-individual variation in the involvement of peripheral blood lineages. We also focus on poorly studied aspects of MPN stem cell biology, in particular metabolism, that could have major impact on the biology of MPN and may represent target for specific intervention.

In addition, alterations in the number, localization and reactivity of mast cells are typical features of systemic mastocytosis (SM), a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by an increase in mast cell burden. Multiple genetic and epigenetic mechanisms can contribute to the onset and severity of all types of mast cell-related diseases. Epigenetic modifications are known to play a fundamental role in the regulation of gene expression without changing the DNA sequence. Among these, cytosine methylation (5mC) in the genomic DNA is mediated by DNA methyltransferases enzymes (DNMTs), whereas TET enzymes oxidize 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). While the role of 5hmC in regulating gene transcription is still not completely understood, an increase of 5mC at promoter regions is usually associated with transcriptional silencing, and altered 5mC landscape as well as mutations in both DNMT3a and TET2 enzymes are implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of myeloid diseases, including SM. Moreover, our lab recently found that the overall genomic levels of 5hmC and 5mC in patients with SM were significantly lower compared to healthy individuals, highlighting the importance of these modifications in SM and more in general in mast cell biology. Therefore, since the role of DNA-modifying enzymes in mast cell differentiation and activation was never investigated, our aim is to understand how the activity of TET2 and DNMT3a can modulate gene expression and cellular functions in mast cells. During my PhD, I found that Tet2-ablated mast cells are characterized by cell-intrinsic delayed differentiation, reduced cytokine production and hyperproliferation compared to their wild-type counterparts. With this project, we specifically propose to investigate the molecular mechanisms that underlie the phenotypes observed in Tet2-deleted mast cells, with particular focus on proliferation, since this might be potentially linked to the abnormal growth and accumulation of mast cells in SM patients. Furthermore, we found that cells lacking Dnmt3a show enhanced degranulation capacity and massive production of cytokines, pointing toward an in vivo role of DNA methylation also in mast cell-activation disorders such as allergy and severe anaphylactic reactions. Therefore, in order to gather a deeper understanding of the DNMT3a-dependent modulation of mast cell activation and function, I will perform in vivo experiments in models of acute and chronic hypersensitivity as well as gene expression profiling of Dnmt3a-/- mast cells. Overall, our study will be beneficial not only for SM, but also to allergy and asthma, characterizing novel molecular targets that could be modulated in all mast cell-related diseases. Research in these projects was temporarily suspended because of my maternity leave, but I will nevertheless be able to complete my PhD by May 2016. However, because of my new family commitments, I will not be able to move and change lab for a post-doctoral training immediately after defending my PhD, as it was originally planned, and since there are no other research institutes in Ticino focusing on the immune system, I would be forced to change completely my goals and aspirations. Vice versa, by remaining in my current lab for a slightly longer period of time (18 months), I would be able to benefit fully of the completion of a number of projects, in terms of publications and acquisition of new technical skills, and at the same time allowing my partner’s career to proceed to such a point that we can safely move our family towards our next career step.

Evidence suggests that leukemic cells originate during fetal life; however, prevention strategies are lacking because the causes of childhood ALL are not yet well understood. Currently lacking in this field is an understanding of the role of DNA methylation (epigenetics). Indeed, aberrant DNA methylation patterns are found in leukemic cells during ALL oncogenesis. These patterns are likely created during progenitor cell development, and are known to modify gene expression and cell and tissue phenotype, without modification in DNA sequence. Folate (or vitamin B9) is a necessary cofactor for DNA methylation, which-along with vitamins B2, B6 and B12-is involved in the “one-carbon” metabolic cycle, and may be a limiting factor in DNA methylation. The Childhood Leukemia International Consortium study has shown that folate intake supplementation during pregnancy was associated with a lower risk of childhood ALL. Moreover, my preliminary results support the hypothesis that the availability of folate during pregnancy could be critical, due to its potential limiting effect on DNA methylation. Several studies have indeed hypothesized that folate depletion during pregnancy and altered folate metabolism might lead to aberrant DNA methylation, which could lead subsequently to ALL development.Hypothesis Based on preliminary findings and on previous studies, I postulate that low folate intake during fetal development might modify the neonate’s DNA genome-wide methylation pattern, and that such a modified pattern can lead to ALL development during childhood.Methods I will incorporate for the first time key measurements of biomarkers of one-carbon metabolism (blood homocysteine concentration and folate in erythrocytes) in 1,400 ALL children and healthy controls at birth, as well as in a subset of 400 mothers of those children at the second trimester of their pregnancy. Genetic material (DNA) will be obtained from dried-blood spot (DBS), and will be subjected to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450K Array method of DNA methylation analysis. The dataset will be split into two equal parts, one for the discovery, and the other for the validation of the results.Analyses I will investigate the potential association between the genome-wide DNA methylation pattern at birth and any differences in one-carbon metabolism with the risk of developing ALL in childhood. In addition, I will test for a synergic effect of the maternal and child’s folate status on child’s DNA methylation profile and risk of ALL. Discussion This prospective approach would be the first to examine folate and homocysteine levels in pregnancy in relation to leukemogenesis, and therefore provides crucial data in the effort leading to childhood ALL prevention. If I confirm the hypothesis, maternal folate and other important one-carbon micronutrient intake (ie., vitamin B6 and B12) during pregnancy could be a relatively easily modifiable factor.

Disease course is usually aggressive and still only a minority of patients can be cured despite improvements in long-term survival rates over the past decades. With the advent of massively parallel (next-generation) sequencing the mutational landscape of adult de novo AML has been elucidated and this has led to a paradigm shift in the understanding of leukemia development. In contrast to the previous model of leukemogenesis that was based on the concept that mutations in signaling pathways (class 1 mutations) leading to uncontrolled proliferation must co-occur with mutations in transcription factors (class 2 mutations) leading to blocked normal myeloid differentiation, current data suggest a more complex molecular pathogenesis. Although the number of recurrently mutated genes in AML is relatively small and adult de novo AML genomes contain only 3-4 driver mutations on average, recurrent mutations affect genes with multiple cellular functions including transcription factors, epigenetic modification and RNA splicing. Mutations in TP53 which encodes the fundamental tumor suppressor p53 can be found in approximately 5% of de novo and up to 30% of therapy-related AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients and are associated with a particularly dismal prognosis with very poor long-term survival even in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.Thus, better pre-clinical in vitro and animal models are urgently needed to both study the molecular mechanisms of TP53-mutant leukemia as well as to identify synthetic lethal interactions that may represent potential therapeutic targets.To achieve this goal, I will combine several experimental strategies. In a first step, I will generate an isogenic cell culture-based model of TP53-mutant AML. In a second step, I will use various complementary experimental approaches including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, IP-MS and a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 in vitro loss-of-function genetic screen to identify potentially 'druggable' synthetic lethal interactions using the TP53-mutant isogenic AML cell lines. Last, I will use mouse models of TP53-mutant AML to validate putative therapeutic targets in vivo. The findings will not only be informative on basic principles of the pathogenesis of TP53-mutant AML, but importantly, may hold the promise to improve therapies for patients suffering from TP53-mutant leukemia.

Hynes	Institute Friedrich Miescher	Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research	2014-10-01	2017-09-30	The contribution of extracellular matrix to epigenetic regulation of cell fate in stem cell niches	Background: The regulation of stem cell renewal versus differentiation is regulated by the stem cell niche, composed of other supporting cells as well as the extracellular matrix and growth and differentiation factors contained in the microenvironment of the niche. Tenascin-C and tenascin-W are enriched in stem cell niches and many phenotypes of the tenascin-C-deficient mice relate to aberrant stem cell differentiation. Working Hypothesis: We are proposing a novel model of epigenetic control of cell fate through signal integration not only by chromatin modifications in the nucleus, but by the modification of the ECM in the cellular microenvironment through expression of niche-specific ECM proteins and the binding of growth and differentiation factors to this ECM. In contrast to common chromatin-mediated epigenetic control, such an ECM-mediated epigenetic mechanism has the potential to be propagated beyond the death of cells that have established a certain code by instructing new cells that will invade the pre-existing microenvironment or niche, read the code, and act accordingly. We will investigate the presence of tenascin-C and tenascin-W in stem cell niches and will determine whether these niche ECM proteins are changing Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in vivo. Furthermore, we plan to analyze in detail the function of the transcriptional regulator megakaryoblastic leukemia-1 (MKL1) in preparing the niche for sustained Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by induction of tenascin-C expression. Since we have found that a specific variant of MKL1 is induced by TGF-beta, this will provide us with the opportunity to investigate a possible link between TGF-beta and Wnt-signaling mediated by the tenascin-containing niche which may be particularly relevant in fibrosis and cancer-associated niches.Specific Aims: We will be focusing on two main aspects, normal stem cell niches and the metastatic niche in cancer progression defined by four interconnected subprojects: A. We will analyze stem cell differentiation in Tnc-/- and Tnw-/- whiskers and determine Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in these whisker niches. B: We will analyze stem cell differentiation in other niches with high Wnt signaling and investigate a potential correlation with tenascin-C and -W expression and investigate potential phenotypes in these niches in the Tnc and Tnw-deficient mice. C: We will investigate the mechanism of MKL1 induced tenascin-C expression in 4T1 mammary tumors and the lung metastatic niche and a possible connection to matrix stiffening and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. In addition we will perform an unbiased screen for other SAP-dependent MKL1 target genes using mRNA isolated from 4T1 tumors. D: We will study the expression of MKL1 isoforms and tenascin-C and -W expression in liver pathologies including fibrosis and cancer. Also in this model we will investigate a possible connection to Wnt- and TGF-beta signaling.Expected Value of proposed project: In the present proposal we combine our findings on the regulation of tenascin-W expression and the induction of the short isoform of MKL1 by TGF-beta, with the findings that both tenascin-C and tenascin-W induce Wnt-signaling to shed light on the interaction of these two pathways of utmost importance in stem cell niches as well as in cancer progression. Our variant-specific MKL1 antibodies promise to become novel tools in the identification of fibrotic changes in normal tissues and in tumors. Furthermore, an unbiased screen for SAP-dependent MKL1 transcripts in 4T1 mammary tumors in vivo, will provide novel signaling pathways relevant for tumor progression and metastasis.

1164	Nathalie Meyer-Schaller	University of Basel	Departement Biomedizin Universität Basel	2013-02-01	2015-01-31	Transcriptional and Epigenetic Regulation of EMT	The formation of metastasis from a primary tumor is achieved through a metamorphosis of adherent tumor cells to highly migratory and invasive cells. We are particularly interested in the fundamental questions on how these cells with an original epithelial imprinting de-differentiate into metastatic tumor cells with a mesenchymal gene expression profile. During this process, also known as EMT (epithelial to mesenchymal transition), tumorigenic cells undergo a major transcriptional reprogramming that leads to the conversion of benign, adhesive cells to malignant, invasive cells. The massive changes in gene expression during EMT argue for a critical role of master regulators that act on the level of chromatin modifications and direct transcriptional control. To study the epigenetic control of cellular de-differentiation, we induce EMT in vitro by the addition of TGFb to murine epithelial cells and follow the transcriptional and phenotypic changes over time. By combining RNAi screening approach together with microarray analysis and chromatin-immunoprecipitation, we aim at deciphering the complex networks driving EMT. More specifically, we will use a phenotypic microscopy-based screen of transcription (co)factors as well as a functional migration screen to identify and hierarchically group the factors regulating EMT. We are especially interested in epigenetic modifiers and their contribution to EMT and tumor metastasis. Using this approach, we hope to gain a more global understanding of the processes underlying malignant tumor progression and metastasis.

Payne	ETH Zurich	Institut für Integrative Biologie (IBZ) Departement Umweltwissenschaften ETH Zürich	2017-09-01	2021-08-31	Regulatory logic and the evolution of promoter complexity	Living organisms exhibit staggering variation in complexity. From single-celled bacterial parasites such as Mycoplasma to their multicellular eukaryotic human hosts, variation in biological complexity is characteristic of life as we know it. Yet many open questions about biological complexity remain. These include whether complexity tends to increase throughout the course of evolution, and which forces may drive such a trend. Many examples of biological complexity, such as elaborate pigmentation patterns and body plans, result from the transcriptional regulation of gene expression. This regulation is implemented at gene promoters, via the recruitment of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins called transcription factors and via interactions with distal regulatory elements such as enhancers. Genome-wide analyses of transcription factor binding patterns and enhancer-promoter interactions suggest that promoters vary considerably in their complexity, both within and among species. For example, some promoters bind just one transcription factor, and thus regulate gene expression in response to the activity profile of a single protein. Others bind dozens of transcription factors and interact with enhancers in a cell-type specific manner, which facilitates the combinatorial control of gene expression in response to changing cellular conditions. How gene expression responds to such changing conditions is known as regulatory logic. Deciphering regulatory logic is key to understanding how the cell integrates information from its environment to regulate gene expression in space and time.We know very little about promoter complexity or its evolution, and even less about the regulatory logic encoded by promoters. One of the reasons is that the requisite genetic, epigenetic, and expression data did not exist prior to the recent formation of large-scale consortia such as ENCODE, FANTOM, and the Cancer Genome Atlas. Combined with computational models of gene regulatory networks, such data can be used to characterize promoter complexity, to study its evolution, and to infer the genome-wide incidence of regulatory logic in species as different as yeast and human. These are the goals of this project. Accomplishing them will provide fundamental insight into the operation and evolution of transcriptional regulation --- a cellular information processing system that is essential across the tree of life.

Epigenetics has been mostly studied in eukaryotes such as fungi, plants and humans, where it has now become evident that it plays important roles during embryogenesis, cellular differentiation, genomic imprinting and cancer development. Methylated cytosines (m5C and m4C) and adenines (m6A) are also frequently found in bacterial genomes due to the activity of restriction-modification systems acting as immigration controllers preventing horizontal gene transfers, but also of orphan DNA methyl-transferases (MTases) involved in DNA mismatch repair and/or in regulating gene expression to control a variety of processes including pathogenesis and virulence. Our previous work on the cell cycle-regulated DNA MTase CcrM that is found in most Alphaproteobacteria, has uncovered a tight connection between adenine methylation and cell cycle control in the model C. crescentus bacterium. Still, too little is known on which genes are directly regulated by DNA methylation in Alphaproteobacteria and on epigenetic regulators that can sense DNA methylation marks to modulate gene expression. The first aim of this proposal is to address this issue directly. We will use (epi)genomics and classical molecular biology methods to identify genes regulated by DNA methylation in the environmental bacterium Caulobacter crescentus and in the distantly-related Agrobacterium tumefaciens plant pathogen. We will then select the most interesting genes, preferentially regulated in a CcrM-dependent manner in all three bacteria, to identify novel and conserved epigenetic regulators in C. crescentus using forward genetics or biochemical screens. Considering that the expression of the majority of the genes suspected to be regulated by DNA methylation is cell cycle-regulated and/or encoding proteins involved in DNA metabolism in C. crescentus, we hope to uncover novel cell cycle regulators that we will characterize in more details to reveal their mechanism(s) of action and their function(s) in Alphaproteobacteria.Although DNA methylation plays important roles in so many organisms, it comes with a serious drawback: m5C can be accidentally deaminated into thymines (T). Resulting TG DNA mismatches must be corrected before they get replicated or they can turn into permanent mutations. Bacteria use Vsr endonucleases during the Very Small Patch (VSP) repair process to eliminate these mismatches but the regulation and the specificity of this process remain unclear, especially in bacteria that have multiple cytosine MTases and multiple Vsr-like proteins like C. crescentus. The second aim of this proposal is to characterize and visualize the VSP process in live C. crescentus cells using molecular genetics and state-of-the-art microscopy experiments. Considering that VSP repair also requires MutS and MutL, two proteins also involved in the repair of DNA mismatches escaping from the proofreading activity of the replicative DNA polymerase (MMR), we will study the potential competition or cooperation between MMR and VSP repair in C. crescentus cells. Defects in DNA mismatch repair are a concern for human health as they can promote the incidence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains or of several cancers and neurodegenerative diseases.

If left untreated, malaria can become life threatening and took about 627’000 lives in 2012, the majority being children and pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa. It is caused by apicomplexan parasites of the genus Plasmodium, which are transmitted by female Anopheles mosquitoes. When sexual stages of Plasmodium are taken up during a mosquito blood meal, male and female gametes fuse in the mosquito midgut to form a tetraploid zygote. The Plasmodium zygote then develops into a motile stage called the ookinete, which migrates through the mosquito midgut wall and forms an asexually growing sporulation oocyst at the basal lamina. It is known that this journey through the mosquito acts as a bottleneck in the parasite's life cycle where numbers decrease drastically. Therefore, this is a favourable stage for an intervention to take effect. In the last decade, it has become increasingly clear that epigenetic mechanisms are a very important hallmark in the parasite’s survival strategy within the human host. However, our knowledge of epigenetic orchestration of gene expression in the mosquito-stage parasites is virtually absent. Here, we will undertake a comprehensive investigation aiming to unravel the regulatory mechanisms underlying gene expression in the developing zygote/ookinete and how this might be related to the parasite transmission strategies through the vector. We believe that detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling malaria parasite development in the mosquito midgut will add substantially to the understanding of malaria transmission biology. This study will expand our understanding of epigenetics in Plasmodium sexual stages and can pave the way for the testing of epigenetic drugs towards blocking malaria transmission.

It is currently unknown how different subclasses of RNAs are involved in this information transfer, nor where they originate. This study aims at elucidating the mechanistic contribution of non-coding RNAs to the impact of environmental factors on the offspring. I will achieve this goal by analyzing the RNA expression and DNA methylation profile after an exposure to early life stress in germ cells (mice) and serum (humans) of the exposed individuals and in zygotes of the paternal line offspring (mice) using the well established MSUS mouse model (Franklin et al 2010) of early trauma and high throughput state of the art sequencing methods. Then, in sperm altered subclasses of RNAs of MSUS and control animals will be microinjected into fertilized oocytes of naïve females to screen for effects in the offspring similar to those reported for natural paternal line offspring of MSUS mice. Further, I propose to assess the functional relevance of serum RNAs, previously identified to be affected by early life stress, by performing a serum transfer from exposed to naïve animals followed by a behavioral screen of the resulting mice and their offspring. I expect to determine RNA subclasses that are relevant for transgenerational transmission of acquired information. Further, I hope to identify genomic target regions of these classes of RNAs, the time point when they act on their target, their mechanism of action and their relevance in serum. These findings will help to elucidate their contribution to the propagation of environmental signals impacting the organism and specifically the brain across generations. The foreseen study should finally contribute to diagnosis of environmentally compromised individuals. It will bring us one step further towards a mechanistic prevention of maladaptive alterations. Future studies could benefit from my expected findings to identifying epigenetic personalized drugs to reverse trauma induced alterations to protect potential offspring from an increased risk load to predisposition for diseases.

Most of them occur with no family history and no known cause. Aging is a major risk factor for most of these diseases, therefore they gain increasing attention since the life span of mankind is improving. As the causes are unknown, it is generally difficult to model such conditions in animals or cell culture to study pathogenic mechanisms or to test potential therapeutic strategies. From the central nervous system (CNS), tissue samples can only be removed when the patient reaches the end stage. Due to these difficulties, researchers started to make use of the recently developed reprogramming technology that allows reverting human skin fibroblasts to pluripotent stem cells. The generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can then be differentiated in various cell types including the ones found in the CNS. However, reprogramming erases most of the epigenetic memory that is steering the expression of genes and has been demonstrated to be directly involved in adult onset neurodegenerative diseases. Up to now, iPSC lines from patients with different neurodegenerative diseases including ALS have been produced, but once these cells are differentiated into disease relevant cell types, they mostly fail to reproduce the phenotype observed in patients.In 2011, a more direct and faster approach for the generation of neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) from mouse skin fibroblasts was published, which is presumably also leaving more of the epigenetic memory intact.In the presented study, we want to apply this approach to human skin fibroblasts from sporadic ALS patients in order to establish a rapid method to produce astrocytes and model ALS in vitro. My preliminary data demonstrate that with this method, I am able to generate ALS patient derived astrocytes. These cells convey toxicity towards motor neurons in a similar manner as primary human ALS astrocytes and ALS astrocytes derived from post-mortem spinal cord NPCs. This finding is exciting, as astrocytes derived from ALS iPS lines failed to reproduce such pathologic features in several independent laboratories. Thanks to the close collaboration with the ALS clinic at the Ohio State University Hospital, our laboratory now possesses both, iPS lines as well as fibroblasts from the same patient. Having established the direct conversion for human fibroblasts, we are now able to compare astrocytes derived by the two different methods in order to expose disease relevant differences in the transcriptome. Therefore this project is of huge interested for the ALS field, but also for a broad science community working on neurodegenerative diseases, reprogramming or differentiation and epigenetics. Finally, our findings can help to unravel potential new therapeutic targets against this devastating disease.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Fellowships for advanced researchers	None	None
1170	Peter Zeller	van Oudenaarden group Hubrecht Institute University Medical Center Utrecht	van Oudenaarden group Hubrecht Institute University Medical Center Utrecht	2017-07-01	2018-12-31	Investigating differentiation using parallel single cell transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis	Epigenetic mechanisms including histone modifications are considered key regulators of transcription. The majority of our current knowledge comes from correlation studies comparing transcriptional activity with the distribution of the epigenetic modification and the transcriptional consequence of the loss of a specific modification. While these results are essential to understand the potential function of each epigenetic modification, they are not sufficient to conclude their role in the orchestration of transcriptional changes. More recent studies tried to answer this question by comparing transcription and epigenetic modifications in undifferentiated and differentiated cells. While these experiments clearly identified changes in the epigenetic landscape, this approach does not answer if they are guiding transcriptional changes during differentiation or securing the resulting new stage. To gain a global understanding of the order of events, we aim to identifying changes in gene expression and main transcriptional repressive and promoting histone modifications in cells undergoing differentiation.First, we will develop a novel approach to examine the distribution of histone modifications on a single cell level. For this we will adapt a method based on antibody targeted micrococcal nuclease (ChIC-seq (Schmid et al. 2004)), which will lead to a modification dependent enzymatic digestion of the DNA. In comparison with existing single cell ChIP approaches this method lacks a precipitation step, leading to minimal material loss per cell. At the same time, this approach enables us to use a variety of histone mark specific monoclonal antibodies that already exist. To study the endogenously changes in the order of events during transcriptional programs, we will look specifically at cells undergoing differentiation. Previous work in the Oudenaarden lab (Grun et al. 2016) lead to the development of the pipeline (RaceID + StemID) that allows to infer differentiation stages from single cell RNA seq experiments. One intriguing result from this work was the identification of cells in the process of differentiation, showing a transcription profile in between known cell types. The second aim of this proposal will use an existing stemID data set in the lab to identify suitable surface markers based on their expression that will allow the enrichment of a specific differentiating cell population in a FACS experiment. Indexed sorting will verify the success of this approach. As a continuously differentiating and proliferating tissue, the mouse hematopoietic system provides a large starting population with well-characterized surface markers usable for FACS. Third, we will adopt the previously described method for co-acquisition of transcriptomic and epigenomic information, based on a protocol for co-extraction of RNA and DNA from a single cell existing in the lab (Dey et al. 2015). Identifying the order of transcriptional changes occurring during differentiation will already allow us to identify the first changes that start the differentiation process, providing an unbiased approach for the identification of key differentiation drivers. Comparing the gene specific changes in transcription and epigenetic state will further enable us to clarify if epigenetic changes predict transcriptional changes or the other way around.

Importantly, emerging data support the hypothesis that such cognitive disorders and neurodegeneration could be triggered, at least in part, by the increased inflammation observed in obesity not only in peripheral metabolic tissues, but also in central nervous system (CNS). However, comprehensive and functional studies are required to understand how nutritional challenges, such as high fat diet, can specifically alter the inflammatory pattern in distinct cerebral areas. Based on these premises, the principal aim of this project is to investigate the impact of an acute (1 week) and chronic (6 and 20 weeks) high fat diet (HFD) on the neuroinflammatory response, focusing on brain regions involved in cognitive functions, learning and memory (hippocampus and cerebral cortex) and brain area relevant to the control of energy homeostasis and metabolism (hypothalamus). Moreover, we will explore the implications of epigenetic changes in the neurological consequences of a high fat regimen. The collection and the analysis of cerebral tissues after 1 and 6 weeks of HFD will be performed during the 3 months working period spent in Lausanne by the visiting fellow, while brain areas at 20 weeks will be collected by the host laboratory and evaluated in Milan for inflammatory parameters, accordingly to the protocol established together. The project will be organized in 3 main specific aims.1)Characterization of the neuroinflammatory response induced by HFD. The pro-inflammatory effect of HFD will be evaluated in hippocampus, cerebral cortex and hypothalamus. For each area, the activation of microglia and astrocytes, the two cellular populations resident within the CNS which are involved in the local organization of the neuroinflammation, will be estimated by measuring the expression of specific markers and proinflammatory citokines. 2)Definition of the glial responsiveness profile induced by HFD. We will examine the state of activation and reactivity of primary microglial cells isolated from control and HFD-fed animals. To this aim, we will measure the expression and release of inflammatory citokines after treatment with a classical inflammatory stimuli (i.e. lipopolisaccaride). This approach will allow to characterize the responsiveness and the immunophenotype gained by glia cells after HFD challenge, following its temporal evolution.3)Evaluation of the epigenetic control of HFD-induced neuroinflammation. Among others, epigenetic regulation is a likely candidate for persistent changes in metabolic and brain function as a consequence of a HFD. To evaluate the involvement of epigenetic changes in the HFD-induced response in the brain areas under exam, the pattern of several histone marks, particularly histone acetylation marks, will be evaluated by ChIP at the level of key genes of the inflammatory response (i.e. IL-1ß?and TNF-a). The successful execution of the present project will provide first a systematic analysis of the neuroinflammatory effect of HFD in different cerebral areas. In parallel, we will obtain mechanistic insights on the role of epigenetic alterations in such inflammatory response. Thus, our study will produce an important piece of information about the molecular events triggering the effects of HFD on the CNS and will open new perspectives in the study of the obesity-brain connection.

The epigenetic “instruction manual” is indeed complex, but a deeper understanding of mechanisms may have far-reaching implications for the early identification and treatment of disease, such as cancer. Advances in technology, and in particular low-cost high throughput DNA sequencing (HTS), have driven an explosion of nucleic-acid-based epigenetics research. Unraveling genetic and epigenetic mechanisms as they relate to development and disease will require a generation of research and a large amount of new data. As computational scientists, we will address the needs of the genome biology community, specifically targeted at quantitative HTS data (e.g. expression or enrichment levels), with a dual-pronged attack: i) we will improve existing “low-level” data analysis methods, to model and adjust for the many biases that affect these datasets; ii) we will create new, innovative “high-level” methods and software tools to assemble and interpret the multifaceted datasets, in close collaboration with researchers that collect the data and who have intimate knowledge of the biology. Specifically, we will use our expert knowledge in the analysis of count data and apply new and improved approaches to interpreting epigenomic data. Existing approaches do not account for all of the artifacts and features of real data (e.g. GC content, copy number), so there multiple situations where we can bring computational skills and experience to bear and create lasting analysis solutions.Our team of computational scientists is fully immersed in and motivated by biological investigations. The data for our proposed methodology development is being generated within the scope of existing projects and importantly, we are involved in the experimental design at an early stage. We will supplement these data with focused benchmarking exercises, to facilitate a better understanding of the data and to validate and compare new computational methods. Our proposal is methodology development, but a large amount of our research time is ultimately spent with our collaborators answering questions in a specific dataset. We do not necessarily drive those questions, but our expertise drives the method development that is fundamental to answering them.An attractive aspect of our research is that our methodological developments spread across multiple data types and biological domains. For example, statistical analyses of count data apply similarly to gene expression data (e.g. RNA sequencing), DNA methylation (e.g. affinity capture sequencing), protein-DNA interaction data (e.g. chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing), and so on, with a small amount of domain-specific tuning. Additionally, our group creates user-friendly software based on the widely-used Bioconductor project and our project will train 2 PhD students in the high-demand field of statistical bioinformatics, in a multidisciplinary data-centric setting.

ALS kills 1 in every 300 people and is the commonest reasonto seek assisted suicide. The aim of the STRENGTH consortium is to identify factors that affectsusceptibility to ALS or modify the pattern of ALS onset or survival duration as targets for thedevelopment of new therapies. Until now, the usual approach has been to consider ALS as ahomogeneous disease and identify genetic or environmental risk factors. STRENGTH uses a novelapproach, first using clinical, laboratory and sophisticated clustering methods to identify homogeneouspatient subgroups to increase power, and second using multiple layers of data from environmentalquestionnaires and genetics from the same individuals enrolled in pan-European population registerscovering a population of about 120 million people, to identify for the first time how risk and protectivefactors work in concert to cause and modify ALS. In addition, STRENGTH partners includeepigeneticists, able to develop this field in ALS and to further reveal the interface between genetic andenvironmental interaction. STRENGTH capitalises on existing infrastructure from the EU fundedEuroMOTOR project which enables collection of large data sets, and the JPND funded SOPHIAproject which ensures the data collection follows standard operating procedures throughout Europe,and will enable the discovery of new pharmaceutical targets for ALS.

Distant-acting enhancers are the key elements driving tissue-specific gene activity and are found in vast numbers scattered throughout the non-coding portion of the genome. Very recently, large-scale enhancer discovery approaches in mouse and human embryonic tissues have led to the identification of entire catalogues of such cis-regulatory regions. In particular, genome-wide studies in the developing heart have revealed that many enhancers drive gene activity in discrete subregions or cell types. However, it is currently impossible to predict in which cellular subtype an element with an enhancer signature will be active. Therefore, I propose to establish an in vivo system that allows the direct identification of subtype-specific enhancers in mouse embryos. I will adapt the INTACT technology which has been successfully used in Drosophila and is based on isolation of tagged nuclei marked by individual enhancer activity. Focussing on the developing heart and using high-throughput sequencing approaches I propose to uncover the epigenetic enhancer signatures of various cardiac cell types at a genome-wide scale. Validation using lacZ transgenesis will allow me to identify groups of enhancers with identical subregional activities in the developing heart and to study their dynamics and correlation to cardiac gene expression. The proposed research will uncover the integration platforms of the transcriptional networks active in distinct cardiac cell populations and thus contribute to the understanding of genetic heart pathologies.

Typical heterochromatic regions are landmark chromosome structures, such as centromeres and telomeres. Heterochromatin is epigenetically inherited and is critical for preserving genomic integrity but also for stable inheritance of gene silencing during development and differentiation. Failure to retain these silent domains causes diseases such as cancers, developmental abnormalities, and neurological disorders.From the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S. pombe) to human, the formation and epigenetic propagation of heterochromatin involves the action of the conserved methyltransferase Clr4 (Suv39h in vertebrates) that methylates the histone H3 methylated at lysine 9 (H3K9me). This particular histone mark then specifies the recruitment of downstream factors essential for heterochromatin assembly. Earlier findings in S. pombe demonstrated that the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery is required for Clr4 recruitment to heterochromatic loci and therefore is critical for heterochromatin formation. This mechanism of heterochromatinization is likely to be widespread in eukaryotes since a link between RNAi and histone modifications has now been reported in plants, flies, and mammalian systems. However, the molecular mechanism through which RNAi targets Clr4 to heterochromatin is poorly understood. Moreover, even if Clr4-associated proteins (CLRC complex) are all required for H3K9me and RNAi-mediated heterochromatic siRNAs generation, both central players in heterochromatin formation, the individual mechanistic contribution of each CLRC component in the process of heterochromatin assembly remains to be determined.The focus of this proposal will be on dissecting heterochromatin assembly in the fission yeast S. pombe. Particular emphasis will be placed on the mechanism(s) by which RNAi targets the Clr4 H3K9 methyltransferase to chromatin and on understanding the various functions of the CLRC complex. Efforts will be directed towards: (1) identifying and characterizing the CLRC complex interacting partners following siRNA generation, (2) investigating the role of the E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit of CLRC, Cul4, in heterochromatin formation and (3) revealing the function of the other members of the CLRC complex.For the first aim, we will perform pulldowns with TAP-tagged CLRC members in S phase synchronized cells when heterochromatic siRNAs are generated. The interacting partners of the CLRC complex will be identified using mass spectrometry and their potential role in heterochromatin assembly and in Clr4 recruitment will then be assessed. For the second aim, we will identify the Cul4 ubiquitinated substrates by immunoprecipitations using 6xHis-tagged ubiquitin expressed in a wild-type (wt) and a Cul4 mutant, in which the Cul4 ubiquitin ligase activity is affected. The isolated ubiquitinated conjugates will be identified by mass spectrometry. The ubiquitinated proteins found in the wt strain and absent in the Cul4 mutant will be defined as putative Cul4 substrates. The analysis of these substrates will allow a better understanding of Cul4 role in the regulation of CLRC recruitment to heterochromatin as well as its function in the CLRC complex. In the third aim, we will examine the CLRC complex integrity under various conditions to work out the mechanistic details of the individual role of each CLRC components in mediating heterochromatin silencing.We expect our work to provide a mechanistic framework for understanding the key steps in heterochromatin formation. Not only will this allow a better understanding of heterochromatin inheritance and genomic integrity in the fission yeast S. pombe, but also it will serve as a general paradigm in higher eukaryotes where RNAi and chromatin modifications are also present and connected. Finally, the proposed project should contribute to the understanding of human diseases associated with heterochromatin dysfunction such as cancers or Trinucleotide repeat expansion diseases (TREDs), including Friedreich’s Ataxia. Our work will be performed at Harvard Medical School (HMS), Boston, in the laboratory of Professor Danesh Moazed, who is an internationally renowned expert in epigenetic research. Prof. Moazed and members of his lab have made outstanding contributions to our current knowledge of heterochromatin maintenance and gene silencing. His lab was among the first to highlight the role of RNAi in heterochromatin assembly and function, and therefore Prof. Moazed has the best expertise for the proposed project.

How different epigenetic markers interact in single mouse blastomeres at early stages of development to influence the transcription of genes, and to what extent these processes vary from cell to cell and between embryos, is not fully understood. Although, in recent years a number of methods that enable single-cell omics measurement have been described, their integration to measure more than one entity in a single cell has remained challenging. Here, I propose a novel strategy for the integrated measurement of different epigenetic markers in combination with the measurement of nascent transcripts in single cells. The strategy relies on the use of a combination of specific restriction enzymes, for the measurement of 5-methylcytosine (MspJI), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (AbaSI) and accessible chromatin (MseI and/or NlaIII), as well as 2’-fluoro GTP analogues in combination with specific RNases for the measurement of nascent transcripts. The application of these technologies to pre-implantation mouse embryos will shed light into the relationships of different epigenetic markers and their influence on transcription at the single cell level, and how these processes result in cell differentiation during early development. I further propose to use new deep-learning libraries, such as TensorFlow or Caffe, to quantitatively model and gain understanding of these dynamic processes in single blastomere cells.

Given the fact that all these cells share the same identical genetic blueprint, understanding how the information encoded in the DNA sequence is utilized for cell type-specific function is one of the most fascinating questions of modern biology. Cell type-specific readout of the genetic information results in specific gene expression programs that give rise to unique cellular phenotypes. These patterns have to be faithfully established and maintained once the cell commits to a certain fate. Failure to do so leads to various diseases, including cancer. Although, DNA sequence-specific transcription factors are the key regulators behind these events, chemical modifications of DNA and histones provide additional “epigenetic” layers of regulation. DNA methylation is the paradigm epigenetic modification associated with transcriptional repression in animals, plants and fungi. Its correct deposition is relevant for genome function and development, and is often disturbed in human diseases. While at promoters this modification is associated with transcriptional repression, methylation within the bodies of transcribed genes is compatible with active transcription. Furthermore, its tight correlation to the underlying gene activity suggests that methylation could be required for transcription fidelity and mRNA maturation, two highly relevant processes for determining gene expression programs and cellular identity. So far it remained elusive how the same chemical modification of DNA can exert two opposing functions at promoters and gene bodies. We will address this question by dissecting the mechanisms underlying this context-dependent regulation and readout of DNA methylation in the mouse genome. Towards this we will employ a combination of functional genomics, genome engineering and computational biology approaches in mouse embryonic stem cells models.These results are expected to shed light on the dual role of DNA methylation in promoting gene silencing at promoters and transcriptional activity at gene bodies. Given the frequent perturbation of DNA methylation in various diseases, the gained knowledge will be relevant for novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

In keeping with the crucial role of epigenetic remodeling in early development, it has recently been postulated that epigenetic modifications may be a critical molecular mechanism by which prenatal immune activation can mediate changes in brain development and functions. Recent findings obtained by the Principal Investigator’s research group and others found initial evidence for this hypothesis by demonstrating long-lasting epigenetic modifications, including altered DNA methylation and miRNA expression, in the CNS of the direct descendants. Moreover, the Principle Investigator’s research group has recently provided the first piece of evidence showing that prenatal infection-induced behavioral abnormalities and whole-genome transcriptional changes can be transmitted across generations without additional immune exposures. These transgenerational effects are mediated via the paternal but not maternal lineage, present for at least three generations, and not associated with alterations in post-partum maternal behavior, which altogether point towards epigenetic inheritance via male gametes. The research proposed herein builds on these recent discoveries and aims at extending and corroborating the role of epigenetic modifications as a molecular mechanism mediating neurodevelopmental abnormalities in the direct offspring of gestationally infected mothers and their subsequent generations. The main working hypothesis of the proposed research is that prenatal immune activation leads to genome-wide and stable alterations in DNA methylation and miRNA expression in the offspring’s brain and male gametes, which in turn may be a molecular mechanism for the transgenerational transmission of behavioral dysfunctions and gene expression changes across multiple generations. In addition, it is hypothesized that at least some of the anticipated epigenetic modifications induced by prenatal immune activation causally contribute to the emergence of behavioral and cognitive deficits, so that pharmacological interventions targeting those epigenetic modifications may be efficient in mitigating behavioral and cognitive deficits. These hypotheses will be tested using a well-established mouse model of prenatal viral-like immune activation, which is based on maternal administration of the viral mimic poly(I:C) during pregnancy. Distinct research lines will be conducted to (i) assess genome-wide DNA methylation differences and altered microRNA (miRNA) expression in the brain and male gametes of first- and second-generation offspring of immune-challenged ancestors, (ii) to probe the germ-line dependence of epigenetic inheritance by artificial insemination, and (iii) to explore the therapeutic potential of epigenetically active drugs to ameliorate the emergence of behavioral alterations in the first-generation offspring of immune-challenged mothers and to prevent the transgenerational transmission of behavioral deficits to the second generation. In summary, the proposed research contains novel and highly topical experimental investigations that aim at obtaining imperative new knowledge regarding the epigenetic and transgenerational mechanisms in infection-mediated neurodevelopmental disorders, which in turn may help preventing the possible transmission of disease risk across generations.

Three types of epigenetic alterations are currently believed to be causally implicated in providing cancer cells with the ability to drive tumor growth and progression, namely DNA methylation, chromatin remodelling as a result of covalent histone modifications and non-coding RNAs, particularly microRNAs (miRNA). Precise understanding of such mechanisms may help identify a set of targets for the development of new therapeutic strategies.The cancer stem cell (CSC) model was revived in recent years with the notion that a tumor initiating cell acquires increased self-renewal capacity through genetic mutations and epigenetic modification, maintaining the tumor drive indefinitely. CSC express various embryonic stem cell genes, including CD133, often used a stem cell marker. CSC are capable to reproduce the original tumor in vivo upon injection in immunocompromised mice, thereby giving birth to heterogenous cell subpopulations, composed of CSC as well as more differentiated progeny. As they are more prone to chemotherapy resistance, it can be conceived that targeting and eradicating CSC may lead to cure of cancers in which CSC provide the driving force for growth and progression.In the case of Ewing’s sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT), a group of rare but highly aggressive tumors arising in mesenchymal tissue in children and young adults, conventional chemotherapies are not sufficient to effectively treat patients and prevent relapse, primarily due to early metastasis. 85% of ESFT present a single mutation, the translocation t(11;22), leading to the formation of an aberrant fusion protein EWS-FLI1.The epigenetic state of primary cells is believed to determine whether they may or may not be permissive for oncogene-induced transformation. Thus, in depth understanding of epigenetically regulated cell permissiveness for oncogene expression and the mechanisms that regulate epigenetic changes upon transformation are key steps toward developing rational mechanism-based targeted anti-cancer therapies.The aim of my project will be to further investigate the role of epigenetics in regard to EWS-FLI1 by identifying and characterizing CSC and exploring how epigenetic alterations lead to their emergence and direct their tumor initiating and metastasis promoting properties.1- Determination and analysis of ESFT cells signature epigenetic profile.First, I will describe the epigenetic profile of spherogenic and adherent ESFT cells. I will address the epigenetic markers changes between the more tumorigenic sphere-forming cells and the adherent cells by focusing on histone methylation and acetylation.2- Determination of chromatin modification in CD133+ versus CD133- cells.Secondly, I will determine chromatin modifications in CD133+ versus CD133- cells. These cells will be isolated from fresh human tumor samples or from ESFT propagated in immunocompromised mice. I will also assess the influence of human versus murine microenvironment on CD133+ epigenetic markers.3- Assessment of epigenetic changes that underlie cell permissiveness for EWS-FLI1 expression and function.Finally, as EZH2 has been shown to facilitate EWS-FLI1 expression in fibroblasts, I will perform RNA-seq gene expression comparison between cells transduced with EZH2 and their control counterparts. I will then perform ChIP-seq on both sets of fibroblasts to identify EZH2-induced chromatin mark changes and correlate them with gene expression data. Selected genes could be tested for responsibility in blocking or enhancing permissiveness for EWS-FLI1 expression.The major contribution of this work will be to assess epigenetic differences between fresh primary tumor initiating and non-tumorigenic bulk tumor cells in ESFT. Such a study has never been done in part because of the paucity of primary tumor samples and in part because of the challenge of nano-ChIP-seq technology. My host lab provides me with the possibility to overcome both obstacles as it possesses and continues to obtain primary ESFT samples and has established nano-ChIP-seq technology. In addition, the project will assess the effect of in vitro culture and mouse propagation on CSC and non-CSC ESFT populations, which is a central issue toward understanding how well cultured tumor cells and tumor cells grown in mice represent the corresponding fresh primary cells. Finally, the project will define the epigenetic events that convert a non-permissive to a permissive cellular environment for EWS-FLI-1 expression and function, which will provide important and long sought insight into the pathogenesis of ESFT.

Among them, cell cycle proteins were identified to participate in the early phases of the degenerative process, but so far the manipulation of this class of proteins had only moderate impact in vivo to rescue neurons. During the past years, we also identified that several proteins involved in cell cycle regulation are expressed in the mouse Rd1 degenerating retina. This animal model bears a null mutation in the Pde6b gene leading to rapid rod, then cone loss. All rods are lost at P21. In vitro, the inhibition of the Cdks decreases photoreceptor death by 40%. In vivo, and the ablation of the downstream target of Cdk, E2f1, leads to a temporary rescue of the sensory cells, whereas the inhibition of Bmi1, which is upstream of Cdks, promotes a strong rescue of photoreceptors: 7 to 8 rows of photoreceptors are still detected at P30. Because of this impressive survival effect, the mechanism of neuroprotection merits to be unraveled.Because the Bmi1 Polycomb protein regulates gene expression by chromatin modifications, we propose, as a first approach, to identify the direct targets of Bmi1 in P10 and P12 Rd1 and WT retinas. In Crx-GFP and Rd1;Crx-GFP mice, the GFP-positive photoreceptors will be used for ChIP assays to identify putative Bmi1 binding sites such as the Cdk promoters and some tumour suppressors (p27Kip1 and p57Kip2), knowing that Polycombs can be present or active on these regions. If no targets are identified, a genome-wide study will be performed after Bmi1/chromatin immunoprecipitation. In parallel, the role of other proteins regulating gene expression via Bmi1 action and histone modifications will be considered in relation to Bmi1 and Cdk expression and function. The histone deacetylases 2, 4, and 5 and the DNA methyltransferase EZH2 activities will be investigated according to Bmi1 and Cdk function and inversely. Preliminary results revealed that HDAC activity in Rd1 photoreceptors is necessary for Cdk4 expression as well as to induce cell death. These experiments should reveal how the Polycomb protein network is recruited to the different promoters to control photoreceptor death.In another approach to identify the role of the cell cycle proteins (Bmi1 and Cdks), we will perform a time course study of their expression and actions related to the functions of known actors involved in the process of retinal degeneration (cGMP, Calpain, PARP). These experiments should help to position Bmi1 and Cdks during the death process and to determine whether their functions are implicated in the pathway involving cGMP accumulation, Calpain and PARP activations or if they have a parallel action. Moreover, the identification of a link between Bmi1/Cdks and these proteins will help to determine how Bmi1 and Cdks control cell death. If a novel Bmi1 target is found, epigenetic modifications of its promoter will be investigated.In our hands, the deletion of the Bmi1 gene as well as the in vitro pharmacological inhibition of Cdk action lead to evident photoreceptor rescue. We aim to develop a similar approach in vivo to delay retinal degeneration using a gene transfer approach mediated by AAV2/8 vectors. In order to develop therapeutic tools, we will investigate a shRNA strategy to downregulate cell cycle proteins and test whether overexpression of the p27Kip1 tumour suppressor may block the deleterious actions of Cdk4 and 2. Such development may have important clinical applications.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div. I-III)	311000.0	CHF

Genetic factors contribute to the risk of DKD. If we could identify these genetic factors, we could better understand the mechanisms by which DKD occurs, and thereby accelerate the development of better therapies. We established the GENIE consortium, a collaboration between Queen's University Belfast, University of Dublin, University of Helsinki, and the Broad Institute. Together, we completed the largest genetic study to date of DKD, and successfully identified the first two robust genetic risk factors for DKD. In a separately funded genetic study, we are collaborating with additional groups to extend our efforts and encompass larger samples. To better understand the underlying biology and pathophysiology of DKD, we propose to complement and build on our past and ongoing genetic studies in several critical ways. We will leverage a co-funding mechanism between Ireland, Northern Ireland and the US to carry out a multidisciplinary investigation of DKD. We will assemble and jointly analyze all available genetic data pertinent to DKD, to begin the process of discovering rarer variants with stronger effects on DKD. We will also generate DNA methylation data in kidney and blood, and in patients with and without DKD, and also expression data in samples relevant to DKD. We use a novel and powerful method to integrate the genetic, epigenetic and genomic data to generate hypotheses about the biological causes of DKD, and test these hypotheses with further genetic studies (sequencing in a large follow-up sample) and with functional studies in models of DKD. This international, multidisciplinary collaboration will build on genetic discoveries to help decipher the underlying biology and pathophysiology of DKD and thereby guide the prevention and treatment of this important disease.

Following primary infection, hCMV establishes lifelong latent infection in its host. Although much of the disease burden associated with hCMV infection has been linked to reactivation of latent virus, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process have remained unclear. The proposed project will investigate key molecular events required for hCMV reactivation in myeloid cells focussing on the viral major immediate-early 1 protein (IE1). IE1 is among the very first proteins expressed during hCMV reactivation and therefore an obvious candidate for regulating this process. The function of IE1 has been extensively studied in fibroblasts permissive for viral replication. However, how IE1 may contribute to hCMV reactivation from latently infected cells has not been explored. Our previous work in fibroblasts has shown that IE1 targets proteins of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family to modulate central cytokine-induced signalling pathways including interferon responses. We have also shown that IE1 docks with the nucleosome surface. We propose that the IE1-STAT and IE1-nucleosome interactions are individually required for efficient hCMV reactivation from myeloid cells. We will elucidate exactly how IE1 may promote hCMV reactivation by rewiring signalling linked to STAT1, STAT2 and STAT3. We will also study how the IE1-nucleosome interaction may impact chromatin composition and function pertinent to viral reactivation including core histone ubiquitylation. Finally, we will explore how the relevant IE1-host interactions may be exploited for novel strategies targeting hCMV reactivation. The results from this study will add considerably to our limited molecular understanding of hCMV reactivation from latency and will identify novel strategies to combat this important virus.

Whilst up to 80% of patients treated with intensive chemotherapy can achieve a clinical remission, most will eventually relapse and die. One type of AML, caused by mutations in the genes encoding the haemopoietic master regulator RUNX1 or its binding partner CBFB, is defined by the generation of RUNX1-ETO (in t(8;21) AML) or CBFB-MYH11 (in Inv(16) AML) fusion genes as a result of genomic translocations. There are also mutations in the RUNX1 gene itself. Monitoring translocation patients during remission shows that those with detectable fusion transcripts by RT-PCR are more likely to relapse. We hypothesise that these transcripts originate from pre-leukaemic or leukaemic stem cells (LSCs) that are insensitive to chemotherapy. We will purify LSCs from the bone marrow cells from AML patients at diagnosis and characterise their epigenome using ATAC-Seq and RNA-Seq. Single cell RNA-Seq will examine cellular heterogeneity. We will use this information as well as data from pre-leukaemic cell line models to examine enriched cells from patients in remission to identify additional markers for the presence of minimal residual disease. We also know from the literature and from our preliminary data that the transcription factor WT1 is upregulated in CBF leukaemia and that such patients relapse earlier. To gain an understanding how RUNX1-ETO and WT cooperate, we will map global WT1 binding sites, knock it down or overexpress it to assess how WT1 contributes to the RUNX1-ETO specific transcriptional deregulation. Finally, at Birmingham, the phase II RAvVA trial led by my supervisor Prof Craddock, looks at the efficacy of the epigenetic drugs Azacitidine and Vorinostat in patients with AML. By profiling the chromatin landscape of serial marrow from patients with RUNX1 mutations recruited to the trial, we will gain a unique insight into disease evolution and the emergence of resistance to therapy.

BACKGROUND: Epigenetic and gene expression changes during development play crucial roles in determining cell fate. Insults during this time can cause abnormalities in these mechanisms and lead to diseases later in life, such as schizophrenia or ADHD. Determining the genomic regions that undergo changes during early development is essential to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in development and developmental disorders. To this date, no study has identified the genome-wide epigenetic and gene expression changes that occur in different cell types across several stages of early development. APPROACH: I will characterize the regulatory changes in specific cell populations during early development and identify potential targets for pharmaceutical therapies for neurodevelopmental disorders. Firstly, I will isolate purified cell populations from different tissue structures of the zebrafish embryo at different stages of development. These will be isolated using dissection and aspiration and/or cell sorting technologies. I will then characterise dynamic changes in histone modifications, DNA modifications, open chromatin and gene expression in each of these cell populations, using different genome-wide sequencing methods. To analyse these data I will use statistical methods and bioinformatics analyses. Finally, the epigenomic and transcriptomic changes involved in development identified during my fellowship will be compared to the existing genomics and transcriptomic datasets at Eli Lilly (in collaboration with the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium) to help identify potential pharmaceutical targets for neuropsychiatric disorders with developmental origins.

Study 1: In collaboration with a Norwegian mother and child cohort (MOBA), DNA from 1000 lean fathers and 1000 obese fathers will establish a validated set of obesity-associated DNA methylation marks. We will profile ~300 regions identified from a comprehensive review of published epigenome-wide association studies of obesity. Throughout, methylation will be measured using a targeted sequencing approach (Bis-PCR-seq). To identify potentially reversible, genetically-independent, DNA methylation profiles, we will investigate those SNPs previously identified as being associated with obesity and related traits. Custom multiplex PCR will be used to profile validated obesity associated SNPs. Study 2: We will prospectively recruit a cohort of pregnant women who have conceived with either an obese (n=250) or lean (n=250) partner. We will investigate whether obesity-associated DMPs are evident in blood and sperm of fathers and in cord blood of their offspring. We will determine relative parental contributions and validate our results using mother-offspring pairs from the MOBA cohort. In study 3 we will investigate whether paternal weight loss is associated with reversal of obesity-associated DMPs or small RNAs in blood and sperm of 15 morbidly obese men before and after bariatric surgery, using methods described above. In study 4 we will assess placental function, structure and metabolism of offspring of our obese fathers. Histology and quantitative PCR will characterise nutrient expression and Western blotting - metabolic signaling pathways. Analyses will establish whether small babies of obese fathers are a consequence of poor placental function, through obesity-epigenetic marks in sperm	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	903026.0	GBP

Indeed progress in understanding tumorigenesis mechanisms has proved its therapeutics potential, yet most of them remained elusive or unknown. The research plan presented here is in line with this ongoing effort, proposing to explore promising new mechanisms in tumorigenesis using cutting edge technologies. Cancer cells are characterized by the presence of genetic and epigenetic alterations that lead to loss of cell identity, uncontrolled cell proliferation, cell invasion and metastasis. However, upstream events that drive the appearance and selection of these alterations remain poorly understood. Past two decades has revealed the key function of epigenetics mechanisms in maintaining cell identity and genome stability whereas their corruption is a hallmark of tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Epigenetic information relies on a combination of DNA modifications, nucleosomes positioning and modification, and many proteins that define, maintain and functionally translate this information. Therefore to maintain cell identity, faithfully duplication and transmission of epigenetic information to daughter cells is as important as duplication and transmission of the genetic information. However, little is known about how the epigenetic information is propagated during the cell cycle and recent findings raise the question of its potential implication in tumorigenesis. In S phase, the progression of DNA replication forks provokes a genome-wide disruption of the epigenetic information. This proposal aims to reveal how cells restore epigenetic information after DNA replication and to explore the interplay between these mechanisms and tumorigenesis. To this end, I will combine Nascent Chromatin Capture (NCC), a technology for purification of newly synthetized chromatin that I have developed, with mass spectrometry, high-throughput microscopy and screening technologies in normal and cancer cells. Newly identified players that are subjected to deregulation in cancer will be next characterized in order to understand their role in cancer development and their therapeutic potential.

Whilst the classical brown adipose tissue (BAT) depots disappear during early life in humans, cold exposure can promote the appearance of brown-like adipocytes within the white adipose tissue (WAT), termed brite (brown-in-white). Increased BAT activity results in increased energy expenditure and has been correlated with leanness in humans. Hence, recruitment of brite adipocytes may constitute a promising therapeutic strategy to treat obesity and its associated metabolic diseases. Despite the beneficial metabolic properties of brown and brite adipocytes, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying their specification and activation in vivo. This proposal focuses on understanding the complex biology of thermogenic adipocyte biology by studying the epigenetic and transcriptional aspects of WAT britening and BAT recruitment in vivo to identify pathways of therapeutic relevance and to better define the brite precursor cells. Specific aims are to 1) investigate epigenetic and transcriptional states and heterogeneity in human and mouse adipose tissue; 2) develop a novel time-resolved method to correlate preceding chromatin states and cell fate decisions during adipose tissue remodelling; 3) identify and validate key (drugable) epigenetic and transcriptional regulators involved in brite adipocyte specification. Experimentally, I will use adipose tissue samples from human donors and mouse models, to asses at the single-cell level cellular heterogeneity, transcriptional and epigenetic states, to identify subpopulations, and to define the adaptive responses to cold or β-adrenergic stimulation. Using computational methods and in vitro and in vivo validation experiments, I will define epigenetic and transcriptional networks that control WAT britening, and develop a model of the molecular events underlying adipocyte tissue plasticity.

1189	Dr Laura EME	CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS	None	2019-03-01	2024-02-29	The macroevolutionary impact of epigenetics and lateral gene transfer on eukaryotic genomes	Multicellular organisms (e.g., animals, fungi and plants) are the best-studied eukaryotes but their ancestors and the vast majority of eukaryotic diversity correspond to microbial species (“protists”). The evolutionary history of protists is closely connected to the evolution of the eukaryotic cell itself. However, most protist diversity is still genomically unexplored, limiting our investigation of eukaryotic evolution. For example, while the importance of lateral gene transfer (LGT) in prokaryotic evolution is well recognized, its role in eukaryotic evolution is still debated. In addition, although epigenetic mechanisms represent a hallmark of eukaryotic genome regulation, we know surprisingly little about the evolution of these mechanisms across eukaryotic diversity. The overarching goal of my project is to understand how epigenetic mechanisms and LGT have shaped the macroevolution of eukaryotic genomes. This project has several inter-related intermediate objectives, which each in themselves will bring crucial insights into eukaryotic evolution: 1) reconstructing a robust phylogeny of eukaryotes; 2) inferring the gene content of the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor; 3) tracing the evolution of genes involved in epigenetic mechanisms and obtaining epigenomic maps from under-studied protists; 4) investigating the intriguing hypothesis of a possible interplay between epigenetic regulation and horizontal gene transfer and its influence on eukaryotic genome evolution: Have genes involved in epigenomic mechanisms been transferred between eukaryotes? Do epigenomic modifications affect the frequency of LGT in different lineages? To achieve this, I will characterize the transcriptomes, genomes, methylomes and small RNAs of understudied eukaryotic microbes selected for their key phylogenetic position, and to analyse them using state-of-the-art bioinformatic methods. I will target uncultivated protists, using single-cell techniques and novel genome-scaffolding approaches.	European Research Council	Starting Grant	1499945.0	EUR

The project will first examine how ZMYND8 interacts with chromatin and DNA, where it localizes genome-wide, including understanding the contribution to DNA interaction by its modular domains. We will then explore the transcriptional factors and complexes that ZMYND8 recruits and interrogate their co-localization to ZMYND8 specific loci as well as the fate of ZMYND8 localization in their absence. The attenuation of the expression of MITF and its controlled transcriptional programmes will then be examined, seeking to uncover a link to MAPK inhibitor resistance, as low levels of MITF have been linked to drug resistance in patients carrying activating BRAF mutations. The goal of this project is to describe the molecular mechanisms underpinning the attenuation of the melanoma master regulator, MITF, delineating the key factors controlling its levels and discerning the complexity of transcriptional activation/repression by epigenetic factors in melanomas, offering alternative novel targets for disease treatment in drug resistant, mutated BRAF melanomas.

1191	Dr. Christoph BOCK	Cemm- Center For Molecular Medicine Of The Austrian Academy Of Sciences	None	2016-07-01	2019-06-30	Cancer evolution and identification of relapse-initiating cells (CEVIR)	Background and rationale: Cancer is an evolutionary process where the units of selection, the cancer cells, are constantly changing in response to environmental and iatrogenic selection pressures. Not surprisingly, previous studies focussing primarily on primary tumours and disregarding the characteristics of systemically spread cancer cells failed to identify therapy targets for effective treatment of systemic cancer. Hypothesis: Disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) are often different from cells in the primary tumour and mechanisms of systemic progression and therapy escape are largely unknown. To unravel these mechanisms we need to identify and characterize relapse-initiating cells (RICs). Aims: ÇEVIR (turk.: translate!) will translate an evolutionary understanding of cancer into monitoring assays that guide treatment decisions. CTCs and circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) are found within the blood stream over the course of disease and provide valuable information about this evolutionary process. CEVIR will improve detection of CTCs and ctDNA and differentiate disease-driving mechanisms from epiphenomena. Methods: To monitor cancer evolution, we will genetically determine RICs by lineage tree analysis, generated from primary tumours, DCCs from lymph nodes and CTCs from follow-up samples. Genetic and epigenetic profiling will unravel the molecular features of RICs. This information will be used to establish ctDNA monitoring assays, employing DNA mutations and methylation patterns isolated from plasma with and without extravesicular enrichment. Expected results and potential impact: We will answer if RICs are derived from late arising rapidly dividing clones of the primary tumour or from rarely-dividing stem-like cells and use this information for the development of blood-borne monitoring assays. By tracking RICs back to the earliest seeds of systemic disease, we will develop monitoring assays for pre-existing relapse-initiating cells. FWF-funded contribution: Within the CEVIR project, the lab of Christoph Bock at the CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine (http://epigenomics.cemm.oeaw.ac.at) will focus on low-input and single-cell DNA methylation sequencing as well as on integrative bioinformatic analysis of the generated datasets.

In healthy arteries SMCs exist in a quiescent ?contractile' state, and adopt an abnormal ?synthetic' state in disease, suggesting that SMC phenotype regulation (?plasticity') is a promising target for vascular disease prevention. We showed previously that epigenetic mechanisms control stem cell plasticity. This proposal aims to identify the epigenetic regulation of SMC phenotypic plasticity to understand disease-associated SMC modulation and regional differences in atherosclerosis susceptibility. We will map epigenetic status genome-wide in SMCs and their progenitor cells using stem cell-based models to generate SMCs corresponding to specific vascular beds. The in vivo relevance of identified epigenetic differences between SMC subtypes and differentiation states will be demonstrated by functional analysis in animal models and patient-derived material. This study will provide important insights into SMC phenotype regulation and form a basis to identity fundamental mechanisms underlying vascular disease risk.

We have identified dimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2) as a functional epigenetic mark implicated in regulating VSMC gene expression, including misregulation of matrix metalloproteinase family members. Here we will test the functional importance of the H3K9me2-pathway in vivo and in vitro. Firstly, loss of function assays will be combined with the novel powerful CRISPR/Cas9 technology to manipulate H3K9me2 levels locally at individual target genes. Secondly, a H3K9me2 inhibitor will be used in the carotid ligation model to assess the physiological effect on VSMC phenotypic switching in vivo. Finally, we will identify novel H3K9me2 targets to understand the mechanism by which the pathway operates. Collectively, this work will validate H3K9me2 as a regulator of VSMC plasticity and point towards possible nodes of intervention.	British Heart Foundation	Fellowship	117436.0	GBP

Clearly, novel drug targets and vaccine candidates are needed. In general, promising targets are essential cell cycle pathways such as cell wall synthesis, the main target for most commonly prescribed antibiotics. However, the pneumococcal cell cycle is poorly understood. Specifically, it is unclear how the division machinery (the divisome) finds the middle of the cell to split the growing cell into two equally sized and shaped daughter cells (division site selection). Even more enigmatic is the question how the divisome finds the right angle within the oval volume of the pneumococcal cell (division plane selection). While for rod-shaped model bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis several specific division site selection systems have been characterized, such as the Min system and the Noc system, no such system has been discovered in S. pneumoniae. Recently, however, a putative pneumococcal division site selection protein was described called MapZ (or LocZ), which was shown to be the earliest protein to arrive at the future cell division site. Here, we provide preliminary data which suggests that MapZ in fact is not a division site selector but rather seems to play a role in division plane selection. Thus, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying division site selection in S. pneumoniae remains elusive. In addition to this new finding, we have developed several tools to analyze chromosome segregation and cell division in single live pneumococci. This leads us to hypothesize that S. pneumoniae uses a combination of protein factors, cell wall signals and DNA topology markers to control division. These findings and preliminary data now places us in an excellent position to test this hypothesis and investigate MapZ-based division plane selection and pneumococcal division site selection. We propose to use classical genetics, biochemistry, state-of-the-art single cell analyses, super resolution light microscopy, atomic force microscopy and next generation sequencing approaches to (1) unravel how MapZ and potential other factors such as epigenetic markers on the cell’s surface dictate division plane selection, (2) identify new genes involved in division site selection using TnSeq-based synthetic lethal screens and a newly-developed CRISPRi screen and, (3) study how cell division is coordinated with DNA replication and chromosome segregation, and how the chromosome is organized in S. pneumoniae using high precision cytology.Insights from this research have the potential to make a major step forward in our understanding of the pneumococcal cell cycle. This knowledge might provide new ways to target S. pneumoniae and, subsequently, help in the design of innovative antibiotics.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div.

We will explore how these memories interact with cultural settings in ways that result in malfunctioning and mental suffering. Frequent exposure to the severe stressors associated with domestic and organised violence leads to the detrimental conditions associated with extreme and traumatic stress. Such exposure reorganises the functioning of the brain and mind in a lasting, self-perpetuating manner so that even very subtle cues, sometimes merely arising from imaginative processes alone, can continuously activate a corresponding stage of the defence cascade.We will investigate survivors of organised and domestic violence in different cultural settings: the German trauma clinic, Rio de Janeiro's favelas, the townships of South Africa and a Burundian peace corps. Specifically, with regard to violence and trauma, MemoTV's ultimate goal is to identify the psycho-physiological mechanisms that lastingly alter the functional organisation of brain and mind. As means for suggesting methods to prevent and potentially reverse the consequences of maladaptive plasticity, MemoTV focuses on the exposure to and exertion of violence: (1) These extreme and intense stressors are thought to produce lasting changes. Reversing clinical symptoms and improving psychological functioning through treatment provides the detection of causal mechanisms. (2) The applicant's group has demonstrated international leadership and expertise in field work in war-torn crisis regions. (3) The detection and influence of the mechanisms that govern the cycle of violence and adversity is a highly relevant societal topic.With its bold attempt to redefine the mind and its related functional brain organisation as interactive processes in the co-construction of humans from their genetic and socio-cultural systems, MemoTVenters an uncharted territory.

1196	Professor Marx	Universität Konstanz	None	2014-02-01	2019-02-01	Evolved Replication Systems for Epigenetics	Cells have a broad functional and morphological diversity due to differential gene expression. Research in epigenetics combines the study of inheritable, phenotypical changes in the gene expression pattern of a specific cell type that are not caused by a transformed nucleotide sequence of the genetic code itself. Epigenetic marks are represented by a variety of molecular mechanisms including DNA methylation. Alterations of DNA methylation play a crucial role in the onset of diseases like cancer. Many DNA methylation-based biomarkers have been evaluated and the analysis of epigenetic alterations is a promising tool for disease diagnostics, prognostics, and prediction of drug response. In future, this will allow to adapt therapies to a person, which will increase the chance for successful treatments, minimizing side-effects of chemotherapy and administration of ineffective drugs and thus, prevent the onset of follow-up problems that are associated with these events. Thus, cost-effective but robust means that allow the analysis of DNA methylation-based biomarkers are of urgent need. Several methods for analysis of these biomarkers are employed. However, those that have the required resolution are laborious, time-consuming, and error-prone and thus, prevent broad applications of DNA methylation profiling in clinical diagnostics. The aim of this project is to overcome the barriers that prohibit using DNA methylation profiling in broad clinical applications for diagnostics, prognostics, and prediction of drug response. The objectives will be reached by a multidisciplinary systemic approach harnessing the power of organic synthesis (i. e. new synthetic modified nucleotides), biochemical and structural enzyme studies, and directed evolution of DNA polymerases tailored for new replication systems for epigenetics. The evolved replication systems will be superior to known techniques by superseding the bottle necks of current approaches paving the way for broad applications.

Heterothermy (daily torpor and hibernation) allows animals to save energy in response to reduced food availability. Although heterothermy in adult mammals has been studied in detail, there is very little knowledge on juvenile heterotherms, which are under strong selective pressure to grow and fatten before winter. This study first aims at investigating how the expression of heterothermy, in response to varying food availability during development, shapes torpor proneness at adulthood. We specifically hypothesize that individuals born under harsh conditions, which make extensive use of torpor, are better prepared to use this strategy later in life. By means of implanted temperature loggers, we shall study the use of torpor during different developmental stages in a heterothermic species, the garden dormouse (Eliomys quercinus). This species can use both daily or prolonged torpor and hibernation, allowing us to investigate the flexibility of torpor use at different developmental stages. Complementary to torpor, another widespread energy-saving strategy is huddling (social thermoregulation). Only a few species use both strategies, including the garden dormouse. A major advantage of huddling is that it allows the maintenance of a high body temperature necessary for growth. Little is known about the synergetic physiological mechanisms linked to the use of both torpor and huddling. The second aim of this study is to determine how the use of both strategies allows individuals to maximize energy savings in response to environmental constraints. We shall reveal the energetic responses and their consequences by combining methods to determine energy expenditure (respirometry, doubly-labelled water) and body composition (isotopic dilution), to measure body temperature (implanted loggers) and heat loss via surface temperature (infrared thermography), and to assess levels of oxidative stress (ELISA) and dynamic of telomere length (qPCR). We expect to reveal different phenotypic strategies, i.e. differences in the separate or combined use of torpor and huddling in response to varying food availability at differing developmental stages. The strategies could be spread in a population through epigenetic transmission. As a third aim, we will determine the multigenerational transmission of epigenetic marks involved in the regulation of torpor and huddling. An epigenetic mechanism is thought to explain how these energy-saving phenotypic traits can be transferred across generations during episodes of energetic shortage.

1198	Paola Scaffidi	The Francis Crick Institute	None	2015-02-01	2017-01-31	Identification of Epigenetic Mechanisms regulating Cancer Stem Cell Formation and Function	Background Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been implicated in the maintenance of various types of cancer and promise to be critical therapeutic targets. Characterization of the molecular mechanisms regulating CSC function is crucial to develop CSC-targeted therapies. Yet, due to the difficulty of isolating pure CSC populations and manipulating them ex vivo, our understanding of their biological properties is still limited. We have recently overcome these limitations by developing a method for the generation of human cells with functional hallmarks of CSCs through oncogenic reprogramming of somatic cells in vitro. Being controlled and amenable to experimental manipulation, this system represents a unique tool to study CSC biology. We will use in vitro-generated CSCs to perform CRISPR/Cas-based loss-of-function screens, with the aim of discovering novel mechanisms important for CSC formation and function. This study has the potential to identify novel biomarkers and new molecular targets for cancer therapies. Aims and Methods 1. Generation of a fluorescent CSC reporter. In order to monitor the phenotype of tumorigenic CSCs in living, unstained cells, we will generate a dual-color CSC fluorescent reporter, taking advantage of genes which are strongly up- or down-regulated in in vitro-generated CSCs and correlate with tumorigenic potential. 2. Primary screening. CSCs or partially-reprogrammed precursor cell lines expressing the fluorescent reporters will be used in two distinct CRISPR/Cas loss-of-function screens using available pooled gRNA libraries. In the first screen we will use the partially reprogrammed cells and screen for gRNAs which promote CSC appearance, to identify tumor suppressors. In the second screen, we will use the CSCs and screen for gRNAs which inhibit their tumorigenicity, to discover novel therapeutic targets. 3. Hit validation. To rule out off-target effects, primary hits will be validated using distinct gRNAs, and by performing rescue experiments. As a final read–out, in vivo xenograft assays will be used to assess cell tumor-initiating ability. How the results of this research will be used Based on preliminary results, we expect to identify numerous proteins affecting CSC formation and function. Priority for validation in clinically-derived CSCs will be assigned based on various criteria: correlation between gene expression profiles and clinical outcome using publicly available datasets, existence of reported mutations, single cell analysis on tumor sections, target druggability and availability of tool compounds. Follow-up drug screening will be performed using the same experimental system and read-outs. The prognostic value of the identified hits will also be analyzed.

In addition, epigenetic alterations are now linked to several human diseases including cancers. A common feature of many epigenetic phenomena, for which X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) is the paradigm, is the implication of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Regulatory ncRNAs belong to 2 major classes: (i) long ncRNAs, which can be transcribed from a single strand as well as in the opposite orientation when they may overlap with either protein-coding or non-coding genes. Both sense (Xist) and antisense (Tsix) ncRNAs control the initiation of XCI; and (ii) short ncRNAs, such as si- or miRNAs, which interfere, through different pathways, with gene function.The aim of this project is to gain insights into the regulation and function of ncRNAs in the control of gene expression program, using XCI as a model system. We propose to combine molecular genetics, embryology and cell biology to (1) decipher the transcriptional control of Xist and the coordinate regulation of the Xist/Tsix sense/antisense tandem in relation to developmental programs; (2) functionally characterise a novel ncRNA on the X chromosome which nests several miRNAs and for which preliminary data suggest a role in XCI and (3) develop a system to extend our knowledge of the regulatory stages of XCI in human through the use of human embryonic stem cells.Our comprehensive analysis of the function and regulation of ncRNAs in XCI has important implications for our understanding of the numerous diseases associated with abnormal patterns of inactivation and is a critical prerequisite to any subsequent therapeutic approaches. This project is in absolute adequacy with the future Epigenetic and Cell Fate host centre co-headed by Prs. Lalande and Viegas-Pequignot, a large-scale initiative expected to strengthen French and European research in Epigenetics.	European Research Council	Starting Grant	1220000.0	EUR
1200	Gerhard Christofori	University of Basel	Institut für Biochemie und Genetik Universität Basel	2013-01-01	2015-12-31	Unraveling the regulatory network of EMT and malignant tumor progression	Most cancer deaths are due to the systemic dissemination of cancer cells and the formation of secondary tumors (metastasis) in distant organs. Obviously, the migratory and invasive capabilities of cancer cells are critical parameters in the metastatic cascade. 90% of all cancers originate from epithelial tissues, and to leave the primary tumor and to invade into the surrounding tissue tumor cells dissolve their cell-cell contacts and adjust their cell-matrix adhesion sites to a more transient, migratory and invasive mode. Such temporary and reversible phenomenon is known as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that is currently a major focus in metastasis research. EMT itself is a multistage process, involving distinct genetic and epigenetic alterations and a high degree of cellular plasticity. EMT also appears to resemble a de-differentiation process that leads to metastasizing, tumor-seeding cells with stem cell-like capabilities, potentially cancer stem cells. In the past years, a number of genes and regulatory pathways have been identified that are critical for the process of EMT. However, the hierarchic order of these regulatory networks has widely remained elusive. Moreover, cellular and molecular markers with diagnostic and prognostic value for the progression status of a cancer patient are still lacking, and therapeutic targets to repress EMT and thus tumor cell invasion and metastatic dissemination are still to be identified and validated. In the past years, the work of many laboratories, including our own, has demonstrated that the dramatic changes in gene expression that occur during EMT and tumor metastasis are regulated by a large number of transcription factors and miRNAs. Most of these transcription factors, such as Klf4, Sox4, Lhx2, Dlx2, FoxC2, FoxF2, Tcf/ß-catenin and several others, and miRNAs, such as members of the miR-200 family, function as master switches during embryonic organogenesis or in the maintenance of embryonic or somatic stem cells. Moreover, a number of epigenetic modifications play a role in EMT and malignant tumor progression, including gene repression by Ezh2 methyltransferase-mediated histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). These results indicate that complex transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory circuits underlie the multiple stages of EMT and malignant tumor progression. However, the regulation of the activities of these transcription factors and miRNAs and the identification and functional contribution of their direct target genes has just begun to be explored. We here propose to dissect the functional contribution of the most critical EMT transcription factors and miRNAs to EMT and malignant tumor progression. We will employ gain and loss of function approaches in cellular experimental systems in vitro to delineate the combined regulatory functions of selected transcription factors and miRNAs during EMT. Employing chromatin-immunoprecipitation in combination with next generation sequencing we will identify the direct targets of these transcription factors and miRNAs and determine and functionally validate the transcriptional regulatory circuits underlying EMT. Moreover, we will use established mouse models of cancer to determine in proof-of-concept experiments in vivo the functional contribution of selected EMT transcription factors, miRNAs and their target genes to malignant tumor progression and eventually their potential suitability as therapeutic targets. Finally, we will assess the significance of our findings in cancer patients and evaluate whether some of the genes and gene signatures studied here may provide prognostic tools for the prediction of clinical outcome. From these experiments we not only anticipate novel insights into the molecular regulation of malignant tumor progression but also envision developing new strategies towards innovative cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapy.

The number of QALY gained will be estimated by administering the EQ-5D-5L and applying a UK tariff for generating utilities. An economic (Markov) model will be specified with appropriate health states to project lifetime costs and consequences. Costs and QALYs occurring after the first year will be discounted at 3.5% per annum. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will be compared with threshold values, and the joint uncertainty in costs and benefits considered (in the trial-based analysis) through the application of bootstrapping and (in the model) using probabilistic sensitivity analysis to generate cost effectiveness acceptability curves. Sample size: Atypical meningioma 5-year tumour recurrence rates are reported as between 39 and 58%. A 0.05 level two-sided log-rank test for equality of survival curves with 80% power would require 86 patients in each arm (total number of events required = 46) to detect an absolute reduction from 40% in the control group arm to 20%. This sample size calculation has been agreed with the EORTC and the UK arm of the trial for which we are requesting funding would aim to deliver 118 participants with a total of 29 events providing 60% power. The remaining patients would be recruited across Europe within the EORTC funded collaboration. A strong magnitude of effect is required to impact clinical practice and establish a treatment policy across the NHS. This is due in part to the expense of radiotherapy, but also the burden to patients – due to the side effects of radiotherapy (hair loss, skin irritation, cognitive decline, secondary malignancy) and its delivery requiring patients to attend hospital daily (Monday-Friday) for 6 weeks. Patient retention will be high as patients with atypical meningioma are routinely followed up long term and data will be collected at routine clinic visits however an adjustment to allow for a 10% loss to follow up has been made, requiring a total number of 190 patients needing to be recruited. Project timetables and recruitment rate: The trial opened to recruitment on 28/04/2016 with planned 63 sites (21 UK & Ireland, 30 EORTC, 12 TROG). Recruitment will close 30/09/2020, with a minimum of 5 years follow-up. Following data cleaning, data analysis and report writing, the project will end 31/03/2026. Translational research: The trial will enable the creation of a biobank for atypical meningioma. The applicants have an established brain tumour biobank (Walton Research Tissue Bank). Ethical approval has been received for tumour tissue and serum banking from patients in participating sites. Separate funding will be sought for research studies: 1. MRI: Volumetric measurements will be used to determine tumour recurrence. The effects of radiotherapy on normal brain adjacent to the resection cavity will be studied 2. Tumour biology: to investigate whether genetic, epigenetic or biochemical factors explain individual variation in tumour recurrence and response to radiotherapy 3.

1202	Prof. Dr. Wilfried ELLMEIER	Medical University of Vienna	None	2007-08-01	2011-12-31	Molecular Characterization of the Transcription Factor MAZR	Cell fate specifications during thymocyte differentiation are linked with the tightly controlled expression of CD4 and CD8 coreceptor molecules. Therefore, understanding the regulation of Cd4 and Cd8 gene expression might not only provide insight into transcriptional control mechanisms during T cell development, but also may help to explain the molecular basis of lineage commitment and function. The expression of the adjacent genes Cd8a and Cd8b is controlled by at least five developmental stage-, subset- and lineage-specific cis-regulatory elements. Combined deletion of Cd8 enhancers E8 I and E8 II leads to variegated expression of CD8 in DP thymocytes, suggesting that chromatin remodeling is required for activation of Cd8 gene loci. We therefore compared epigenetic modifications such as histone acetylation and methylation, and DNA methylation at the Cd8 gene loci of variegated and non-variegated CD8 alleles. We could show that CD8 variegation is correlated with an epigenetic off state. These data link Cd8 enhancer function with chromatin remodeling of the Cd8 gene loci. To study the molecular basis of the epigenetic regulation of CD8 expression in more detail, we have employed yeast one-hybrid screens to search for factors that bind to Cd8 enhancers. We show that the zinc finger protein MAZR, encoded by the Zfp278 gene, bound the Cd8 enhancers and interacted with the corepressor N-CoR complex in DN thymocytes. MAZR expression was down-regulated during thymocyte development, leading to reduced recruitment of MAZR to the Cd8 gene loci in DP thymocytes as compared to DN cells. Enforced expression of MAZR led to impaired Cd8 activation and variegated CD8 expression in DP thymocytes. Our results demonstrate epigenetic control of the Cd8 gene loci and identify MAZR as an important regulator of Cd8 gene expression. Within this FWF Project, we propose to study molecular mechanisms of MAZR function. We want to determine functional domains in MAZR required for the induction of CD8 variegation and we want to investigate the role of N-CoR and N-CoR binding to MAZR for the regulation of Cd8 gene expression. Furthermore, in order to test whether MAZR is essential for the proper regulation of CD8 expression in DN thymocytes and to learn more about the in vivo role of MAZR in the T cell lineage (and in other lineages), we are proposing to generate (conditional) MAZR knockout mice using the Cre/LoxP system. Our studies will provide a molecular link between structural domains and biological activity and will also provide important insight into the physiological role of MAZR.

1203	Professor Xin Lu	University of Oxford	Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research	2012-05-28	2015-05-27	ASPP2: A molecular switch of cancer initiating cells in Squamous Cell Carcinoma?	Around 80% of human cancers are epithelial in origin. Of the different tumour types arising in epithelial tissues, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most malignant and has the highest metastatic potential. Our preliminary results show that the tumour suppressor ASPP2 is able to repress p63 expression, is highly expressed in keratin 1-positive and keratin 14-negative stratified epithelial cells, and that differentiation induces ASPP2's expression in vitro. Most importantly of all, ASPP2 heterozygous and null mice spontaneously develop SCC of the skin. These observations challenge the current view that SCC is derived from basal cells (p63+, keratin 14+/keratin 1-), as ASPP2 is hardly expressed in this cell population. SCC cells may instead be derived from differentiated keratin 1-positive cells in the suprabasal layer. Due to changes in their epigenetic regulation, differentiated keratin 1-positive squamous epithelial cells may start to re-express keratin 14 and p63 to gain a proliferative potential. To determine the precise origin of SCC, ASPP2 will be deleted in keratin 14-positive basal cells and keratin 1-positive suprabasal cells using keratin 14-Cre or keratin 1-Cre respectively. The ability of these mice to develop spontaneous SCC will be studied. To identify genes that ASPP2 uses to suppress SCC, we will also conduct gene array analysis on SCC samples from ASPP2 exon3-null and heterozygous mice, and compare them with tissue samples from wild type mice. The identified ASPP2-regulated genes will then be analysed further to determine whether or not they are involved in epithelial stratification. In particular, genes involved in epithelial stratification and that are targets of the p63, Notch and Wnt signaling pathways will be examined to determine the molecular mechanisms by which ASPP2 is able to suppress the development of SCC.

We have identified 31 loci for AD. The challenge now is to uncover the regulatory mechanisms through which these genetic variants are acting in order to improve our understanding of AD and to inform drug development. I proposed to do this through the integration of existing multi-omic resources. This work will attempt to answer four key questions: 1. What is the causal variant(s)? 2. What is the relevant gene target? 3. What is the affected regulatory mechanism? 4. What are the relevant cells/tissues? To answer these questions a wide-range of existing multi-omic data sources with particular relevance to atopic disease will be curated and analysed: 1. GWAS results (for fine-mapping of loci) 2. Skin and blood gene expression data (for eQTL analysis) 3. Functional predictions & epigenetic annotations from a range of cell types (to identify regulatory mechanisms) Statistical analysis will be performed to identify robust associations and enrichments across cell-types. Specific loci and hypothesis will be explored in a bespoke locus-by-locus approach, as well as developing a pipeline that integrates the methods and datasets in a systematic way for efficient follow of GWAS signals. The proposed work will involve curation of relevant datasets, identification and implementation of the most appropriate statistical methods as well as computer programming to build an effective target identification pipeline.

G4-forming sequences are strikingly rare in the AT-rich P. falciparum genome, and are concentrated around the major family of virulence genes, called var genes. Our recent work has showed that G4 motifs may affect the expression and recombination of var genes, thus contributing to antigenic variation and diversification. Special classes of helicases are required to unwind G4s and we have knocked out two of these helicases in P. falciparum, revealing phenotypes in var gene expression, rates of genomic recombination, and telomere maintenance. We now propose to use genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation to establish the distribution of G4 motifs and their cognate helicases throughout the P. falciparum genome. At the RNA level, we will examine the G4 content of the transcriptome via RNA base modification and structure-specific sequencing. In a second arm of experiments, we will follow up our work on the two 'RecQ' G4 helicases by making and characterising a double RecQ knockout, and also a knockout of the second class of putative G4 helicase termed FANCJ. Finally, we will characterise these knockouts not only in terms of G4-specific phenotypes, but also in their effects on DNA replication dynamics throughout the genome, using DNA fibre analysis. Together, these experiments will provide multiple lines of evidence for the presence and roles of G4s and their cognate helicases in P. falciparum, thus improving our understanding of a novel aspect of malaria biology that is highly relevant to virulence.

1206	Dr William Scott	MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences	None	2018-03-01	2021-03-31	Clinical Lecturer in Endocrinology	Obesity affects >600M people worldwide, accounts for ~60% of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and ~20% of cardiovascular disease, and causes >3M deaths each year. Better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying obesity and its metabolic complications is essential for development of much needed new therapeutics. Epigenetic programming of gene expression and cell functions in response to genetic and environmental exposures is widely implicated in human obesity and metabolic disease pathogenesis. In exploratory human studies, epigenomic variations and their enzymatic regulators are widely associated with obesity phenotypes and major aetiological risk factors. However, examples of causal epigenomic variants in humans are very limited. A major goal of our research is to identify human epigenomic variations and subsequent responses in gene expression that impact obesity phenotypes, then exploit their therapeutic potential. Our strategy is to use high-throughput genomics to discover cell-type specific epigenomic variations linked to human obesity, then state-of-the-art genome-editing tools to assign causation to these variants and their target genes. The discovery of causal human epigenomic changes is a prerequisite for leveraging the therapeutic potential of these reversible mechanisms of disease. Adipose tissue cell-types are the primary focus of our research because of their key roles in obesity and metabolic disease pathogenesis – excess energy storage (white adipocytes), reduced inducible thermogenic energy expenditure (beige adipocytes), and adipo/cytokines effects on systemic energy balance, inflammation and insulin sensitivity (white and beige adipocytes in cross-talk with macrophages and other immune cells). We have used integrated genomic strategies to discover alterations in adipocyte DNA methylation, an important epigenetic mechanism, robustly associated with human obesity and their predicted effector transcripts (cis- target genes). These loci may contribute to human obesity phenotypes if DNA methylation actively regulates the expression of cis- target genes with critical adipocyte functions. Our immediate aim is to establish the cause-and-effect relationships between DNA methylation, cis- target gene expression and disease phenotype, and the underlying mechanisms-of-action, at these loci. Our strategy is to combine complementary lines of evidence from human functional genomics (e.g. targeted bisulfite sequencing, Capture HiC, transcription factor motif analyses), in vitro epigenetic editing (CRISPR-cas9) and in vivo mouse genetic manipulation (Cre-Lox). In parallel, we are developing single cell sequencing approaches to investigate epigenomic and transcriptomic mechanisms in other major adipose tissue cell types – macrophages, other immune and stromovascular cells, adipocyte precursors – underlying human obesity, metabolic dysfunction and weight loss. By intersecting results from epigenomics, genetics, molecular signaling and physiology, our work will deliver new insights into mechanisms of disease in human adipocytes, and a range of translational research targets for obesity and T2D.

The nuclear cloning technology is of interest for transplantation medicine, but any application is hampered by the inefficiency and ethical problems. A breakthrough solving these issues has been the in vitro derivation of reprogrammed Induced Pluripotent Stem ?iPS? cells by the ectopic expression of defined transcription factors in somatic cells. iPS cells recapitulate all defining features of embryo-derived pluripotent stem cells, including the ability to differentiate into all somatic cell types. Further, recent publications have demonstrated the ability to directly trans-differentiate somatic cell types by ectopic expression of lineage specification factors. Thus, it is becoming increasingly clear that an ultimate goal in the stem cell field is to enable scientists to have the power to safely manipulate somatic cells by ?reprogramming? their behavior at will. However, to frame this challenge, we must understand the basic mechanisms underlying the generation of reprogrammed cells in parallel to designing strategies for their medical application and their use in human disease specific research. In this ERC Starting Grant proposal, I describe comprehensive lines of experimentation that I plan to conduct in my new lab scheduled to open in April 2011 at the Weizmann Institute of Science. We will utilize exacting transgenic mammalian models and high throughput sequencing and genomic screening tools for in depth characterization of the molecular ?rules? of rewiring the epigenome of somatic and pluripotent cell states. The proposed research endeavors will not only contribute to the development of safer strategies for cell reprogramming, but will also help decipher how diverse gene expression programs lead to cellular specification during normal development.

However, the persisting poor prognosis of melanoma patients, due to drug resistance and early relapse, underscores the need for additional biomarkers that complement currently applied stratification strategies. In this respect, recent translational research suggests a clinical value of regulatory events; and in particular DNA methylation, which has been recognized as common hallmark of human cancers. Although DNA methylation represents a promising biomarker for clinical diagnosis, prognosis and with a plethora of alterations displaying predictive potential for drug response, the potential of DNA methylation alterations in individualized cancer medicine has yet been poorly recognized. Consequently, we comprehensively screen epigenetic alterations in metastatic melanoma specimens and model systems for their translational value as biomarkers for drug resistance, in order to suggest novel therapeutic strategies overcoming drug resistance. Specifically, we profile a unique set of samples, consisting of drug resistant melanoma cell lines and donor-matched metastatic tumours at genome-scale for differentially DNA methylated loci. Furthermore, we integrate comprehensive DNA methylation and drug sensitivity data to BRAF and MEK inhibitors, to determine predictive models of the efficiency of drug application in melanoma patients. Following the epigenetic association study combining DNA methylation and drug sensitivity, the functional implications of candidate loci and genes are experimentally confirmed using in vitro and in vivo melanoma model systems. Once we confirm the reliability of the candidates in multiple biological and clinical validation steps, we present epigenetic biomarkers, mechanistically incorporated in drug resistance of melanoma cells to currently applied targeted drugs, which provide a rich source for novel therapeutic strategies applicable as precision medicine for melanoma patients.

During T cell development a highly diverse T cell receptor repertoire is probed against a matching array of self-antigens. While the generation of the T cell receptor repertoire relies on unique genetic recombination mechanisms, the corresponding molecular principles underlying the generation of TCR ligands - self-peptide/MHC complexes - are less well understood; recent data indicate that novel principles of epigenetic control are employed. This proposal aims at understanding a unique feature of thymic epithelial cells (TECs), namely the expression of a multitude of tissue-restricted antigens (TRAs), a phenomenon termed promiscuous gene expression (pGE) in the context of self-tolerance. The integrative approach of this proposal has 4 main objectives (i) a characterization of the molecular control of different pools of pGE beyond the role of the Autoimmune Regulator (Aire) in relation to the developmental biology of TECs (ii) a comprehensive and comparative analysis of expression patterns of TRAs in single cells of different species in relation to epigenetic signatures and higher chromatin order, (iii) translating these findings to the cellular dynamics and topology of the thymic medullary compartment, e.g. individual mTEC clones in situ (iv) the modelling of these different levels of analysis by a system biology approach, e.g. testing our hypothesis that clusters of TRAs in the genome represent an ?operational unit? of pGE. We expect from these studies new basic insights into a fascinating and still arcane aspect of the vertebrate immune system, which will also contribute to our understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of human autoimmune diseases.

These effects can be moderated by genetic variants, one of them being functional polymorphisms in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) co-chaperone gene FKBP5. Preliminary studies in my laboratory suggest that this GxE interaction is mediated by allele-specific de-methylation of intronic glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) within FKBP5. The overarching aim of this grant is to identify the molecular mechanisms by which FKBP5 polymorphisms and early trauma interact to increase the risk for a number of depressive and anxiety disorders. In this application, I propose to extend these preliminary data by experiments in healthy controls and depressed patients, human lymphoblastiod cell lines as well as an animal model in outbred mice showing similar GxE interaction to address the molecular mechanism of these DNA-methylation changes as well as their cellular and system level consequences. Finally we will use expression quantitative trait locus analysis for GR stimulated gene expression to identify new loci relevant for GxE interactions in stress-related disorders.Overall, this proposal will follow up on one of the first putative molecular and systemic mechanisms identified for gene x environment interactions in affective disorders and will establish an animal model mimicking these specific interactions. The findings related to this proposal could be of major importance for understanding the biology of these disorders and to explore novel treatment options, including manipulations of epigenetic modifications.

Very little is known on the mechanisms governing TEI and this is the subject of the present proposal. By transiently enhancing long-range chromatin interactions, we recently established isogenic Drosophila epilines that carry stable alternative epialleles, defined by differential levels of the Polycomb-dependent H3K27me3 mark. Furthermore, we extended our paradigm to natural phenotypes. These are ideal systems to study the role of Polycomb group (PcG) proteins and other components in regulating nuclear organization and epigenetic inheritance of chromatin states. The present project conjugates genetics, epigenomics, imaging and molecular biology to reach three critical aims. Aim 1: Analysis of the molecular mechanisms regulating Polycomb-mediated TEI. We will identify the DNA, protein and RNA components that trigger and maintain transgenerational chromatin inheritance as well as their mechanisms of action. Aim 2: Role of 3D genome organization in the regulation of TEI. We will analyze the developmental dynamics of TEI-inducing long-range chromatin interactions, identify chromatin components mediating 3D chromatin contacts and characterize their function in the TEI process. Aim 3: Identification of a broader role of TEI during development. TEI might reflect a normal role of PcG components in the transmission of parental chromatin onto the next embryonic generation. We will explore this possibility by establishing other TEI paradigms and by relating TEI to the normal PcG function in these systems and in normal development. This research program will unravel the biological significance and the molecular underpinnings of TEI and lead the way towards establishing this area of research into a consolidated scientific discipline.

Modern genomics and epigenomics provide us with catalogues of gene regulatory elements and maps illustrating their activity in different tissues. Nevertheless, we are far from being able to explain emergence and maintenance of cellular states from such data, partly because we so far lacked characterization of individual molecular states and genome control mechanisms at their native resolution - the single cell. Recently, new approaches developed by the single cell genomics community, with several contributions from our group, allow massive acquisition of data on the transcriptional, epigenomic and chromosomal conformation states in large cohorts of single cells. In this research program, we aim to move forward rapidly to bridge a major gap between these experimental breakthroughs and models of genome regulation in complex tissues. We will develop algorithms and models for representing data the transcriptional profiles, DNA methylation landscapes and Hi-C maps of literally millions of cells. Our tools will be designed specifically to leverage on new single cell RNA-seq, single cell Hi-C, single cell capture-pBat and higher order 4C-seq that we will continue to develop experimentally. Furthermore, we shall enhance and optimize our interdisciplinary framework hand in hand with a working model aiming at unprecedentedly comprehensive single cell analysis of E8-E10 mouse embryos. This will provide us with hundreds of worked-out cases of tissue specific gene regulation. The techniques and insights from these studies will then be used to characterize cell type aberrations and epigenetic reprogramming in tumors. The open algorithms, techniques and methodology we shall develop can accelerate research in multiple groups that will utilize single cell genomics to study numerous questions on gene regulation in the coming years.

Typically, transcription in leukemia cells is altered by the ectopic expression of transcription factors, by modulation of signaling pathways or by epigenetic changes. In addition to these factors that affect the production of RNAs, also changes in the processing of RNA (its splicing, transport and decay) may contribute to determine steady-state RNA levels in leukemia cells. Indeed, acquired mutations in various genes encoding RNA splice factors have recently been identified in myeloid leukemias and in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In our study of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), we have identified mutations in RNA decay factors, including mutations in CNOT3, a protein believed to function in deadenylation of mRNA. It remains, however, unclear how mutations in RNA processing can contribute to the development of leukemia. In this project, we aim to further characterize the mechanisms of RNA regulation in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) to obtain insight in the interplay between RNA generation and RNA decay and its role in leukemia development. We will study RNA decay in human T-ALL cells and mouse models of T-ALL, with the aim to identify the molecular consequences that contribute to leukemia development. We will use new technologies such as RNA-sequencing in combination with bromouridine labeling of RNA to measure RNA transcription and decay rates in a transcriptome wide manner allowing unbiased discoveries. These studies will be complemented with screens in Drosophila melanogaster using an established eye cancer model, previously also successfully used for the studies of T-ALL oncogenes. This study will contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis of T-ALL and may identify new targets for therapy of this leukemia. In addition, our study will provide a better understanding of how RNA processing is implicated in cancer development in general.	European Research Council	Consolidator Grant	1998300.0	EUR

Germline small RNAs called piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are implicated in transposon silencing by DNA methylation. To understand piRNA biogenesis and function we will characterize new components in the piRNA pathway using a combination of biochemistry, mouse mutants, zebrafish knock-downs and small RNA bioinformatics. We characterized a tudor domain protein and an RNA helicase as key players in mammalian piRNA biogenesis. We also demonstrated a role for Piwi protein methylation in complex formation with tudor proteins, and will examine whether this can be regulated by protein demethylases, making the piRNA pathway more responsive to cellular requirements. The nuclease (slicer) activity of the piwi proteins is suggested to participate in piRNA biogenesis and in destruction of target RNAs. We created a catalytic point mutant knock-in mouse, and will use transcriptomics to identify piRNA targets. To address how the small RNA-guided piwi complex gains access to the target DNA regions buried in the chromatin, we will employ Solexa sequencing (HITS-CLIP) to determine whether nascent transcripts serve as anchors for the piwi complexes. The use of modular proteins that can molecularly link piwi protein methylation to modified histones will be examined. Research in the field is dependent on animal models and this is a limitation. We have developed an insect cell culture system and will use it for a high-throughput imaging-based functional RNAi screen for piRNA pathway mutants. In summary, this proposal aims to use interdisciplinary approaches to understand the biogenesis, mechanism of action and biological role of germline small RNAs in genome integrity.

Before becoming evolutionary successful, newly formed polyploids often have to overcome fertility bottlenecks, because mating with partners of lower ploidy causes incompatibilities in the endosperm leading to the formation of mainly non-viable progeny. This reproductive barrier is called the triploid block. Nevertheless, the most frequent route to polyploid formation is probably through unreduced gametes, suggesting that the triploid block can be overcome. Recent work from our laboratory uncovered a genetic pathway leading to unreduced gamete formation at high frequency and revealed that the triploid block is mainly caused by malfunction of Polycomb group (PcG) proteins. PcG proteins are evolutionary conserved proteins, which assemble into multimeric complexes with chromatin-modifying enzymatic activity, implicating epigenetic regulatory mechanisms as an important element of speciation. Here, I propose to unravel the underlying molecular mechanism(s) of the triploid block by identifying the responsible genes causing endosperm failure upon deregulation and their mechanism of regulation in response to interploidy crosses. I also plan to investigate whether genes that contribute to the triploid block are as well responsible for establishing interspecies incompatibilities within the Arabidopsis genus. This project will combine genetics, genomics and epigenomics and will make extensive use of knowledge and tools that we have been established in my laboratory over the recent years, making it likely that the proposed objectives can be achieved. The results of this project will be of interest to a broad scientific community, including biologists with a strong interest in epigenetic mechanisms as well as ecologists interested to understand mechanisms of plant speciation.

Although this question remains largely open, there is growing evidence suggesting that chromatin plasticity is a fundamental hallmark of ESCs, providing their necessary flexibility.Previously we found that ESCs possess a relatively open chromatin conformation, giving rise to permissive transcriptional program. Here I propose to investigate the mechanisms that support chromatin plasticity and pluripotency in ESCs.Using a simple biochemical assay which I developed (DCAP: Differential Chromatin Associated Proteins), based on micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion combined with multi-dimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT), I seek to identify ESC-specific chromatin proteins. Selected proteins will be knocked-down (or out) and their ESC function will be evaluated.In addition, I will conduct a hypothesis-driven research using mutant ESCs and epigenetic-related drugs to search for potential mechanisms, (i.e. histone modifications, DNA methylation), that may support chromatin plasticity in ESCs. Based on our intriguing preliminary data, I will also focus on the link between the nuclear lamina and ESC plasticity.Thirdly, we will analyze non-polyadenylated transcription using genome-wide tiling arrays and RNA-seq. We will design custom microarrays containing the identified sequences, which will allow us to reveal, using ChIP-chip experiments, the mechanistic regulation of the non-polyadenylated transcripts. Finally, we will knockout, using zinc-finger nuclease technology, selected highly conserved candidates in search of their function.Understanding chromatin regulation, plasticity and function will enable one to intelligently manipulate ESCs to transition between the pluripotent, multipotent and unipotent states and to expedite their use in the clinic.

Such plasticity or potency is essential to form multiple cell types upon differentiation. In mammals, upon fertilization and fusion of the gametes -two highly differentiated cells- intense chromatin remodeling and epigenetic reprogramming, the reversion into an undifferentiated state, are essential to restore full developmental potency (totipotency). Subsequent development and differentiation are accompanied with progressive loss of plasticity. The transition between totipotency and the gradual loss of plasticity is thought to be regulated by yet-unknown epigenetic mechanisms.The embryonic chromatin displays unique features compared to differentiated cells, including the lack of ?conventional' heterochromatin. We hypothesise that the transition from a totipotent state to a differentiated one is regulated by changes in chromatin states, particularly by de novo acquisition of heterochromatin domains.This project is designed to reveal the nuclear foundations of totipotency by determining the molecular mechanisms underlying the establishment of heterochromatin and their functional role in maintaining totipotency using the mouse embryo as model.We will do this by:i)determining the functional relationship of heterochromatin and nuclear architectureii)by determining the effects of artificially inducing heterochromatin on cell potency during development andiii)by determining the mechanisms that regulate heterochromatin formation in the embryo.We anticipate that our studies will unravel fundamental mechanims on how chromatin states regulate cell potency during reprogramming. By uncovering such mechanisms, we expect to reveal new insights that will be useful to induce epigenetic reprogramming of differentiated cells. Our results will therefore lead to key contributions in the fields of stem cell, developmental biology, human reproduction, chromatin biology and epigenetics.

The reasons for the extension of recombination suppression beyond sex-determining genes remain unclear. Sexual antagonism, involving the linkage to sex-determining genes of alleles beneficial in only one sex, is the prevailing hypothesis, as this explanation is both theoretically plausible and attractive. However, decades of research have unearthed little evidence to support this hypothesis. Furthermore, I have shown that chromosomes involved in sexual compatibility in systems lacking male and female functions can nevertheless display a stepwise suppression of recombination beyond mating-compatibility genes. Thus, evolutionary strata can evolve without sexual antagonism. Alternative hypotheses, such as neutral rearrangements, epigenetic changes associated with transposable elements and the sheltering of deleterious alleles accumulating near non-recombining regions, must thus be seriously considered. I propose to use a synergic combination of different approaches and biological systems to refine and test these hypotheses, to broaden the theory of sex-related chromosome evolution, and, more generally, of the evolution of supergenes (linked allelic combinations). I will use mathematical modeling to test hypothesis plausibility and generate predictions. I will use comparative and population genomic approaches to test predictions, and an innovative experimental evolution approach with functional manipulations to assess the ability of the proposed mechanisms to generate strata. The EvolSexChrom project will challenge the current theory, opening up new avenues of research and potentially creating a paradigm shift in the dynamic research field focusing on the evolution of sex-related chromosomes and other supergenes, relevant to diverse traits and organisms.

Patients may do well after surgery and initial treatment, but drug resistant and fatal metastases often develop. Improved treatment options are urgently needed. The connecting thread of this project is the identification of epigenetic drivers of breast cell fate, tumor heterogeneity and metastasis. Tumor heterogeneity impinges on prognosis, response to therapy, and metastasis and is one of the most important and clinically relevant areas of cancer research. Tumor heterogeneity results from genetic and epigenetic alterations that enhance the plasticity and fitness of cancer cells in the face of hurdles like the metastatic cascade and anti-cancer therapies. Unfortunately, the driving molecular mechanisms remain unclear, particularly the potential interplay between signalling pathways and epigenetic programs. This interdisciplinary project uses pathophysiologically relevant models and state-of-the-art technologies to identify molecular mechanisms underlying crosstalk between key signalling pathways and epigenetic programs in the normal and neoplastic breast. We hypothesize that interfering with these programs will decrease tumor heterogeneity. We will address the effects of: - SHP2/ERK signalling on the epigenetic programs of tumor-initiating cells (Aim 1) - PI3K pathway hyperactivation on the epigenetic programs underpinning cell plasticity (Aim 2) - Epigenetic regulators on normal mammary cell self-renewal and on metastasis (Aim 3) By investigating the integrated effects of key signalling pathways and epigenetic programs in normal and neoplastic breast, this multipronged project will identify and validate mechanisms of cell plasticity. The derived mechanistic understanding will generate means to interfere with tumor heterogeneity and thus improve the efficacy of anti-cancer therapies and ultimately the clinical outcome for patients with breast cancer.

None	2011-12-01	2016-12-01	Polycomb/Trithorax: Functional EpiGenomics Integrators for Metabolic Disease	The last decade has seen an explosion of research into the epigenetic regulation of cell biology. Indeed, great efforts have been made to elucidate epigenetic regulation in stem cell biology, development, and within the plastic states of cancer. Current estimates place the prevalence of obesity in the range of 300 million to beyond 1 billion by the year 2030. As a critical risk factor for heart disease, diabetes and stroke, obesity currently represents one of the world's chief economic and health care challenges. While studies have established a genetic framework for our current understanding of obesity, the contribution of several critical regulatory layers, in particular epigenetic regulation, remains poorly understood.We recently performed the first genome-wide RNAi screen for obesity regulators in the adult fly. Intriguingly, developmental regulators scored among the most enriched pathways (Pospisilik, Cell 2010). Systematic interrogation of the 500 candidate obesity genes by tissue-specific knockdown has now identified the Polycomb-Trithorax system (PcG-Trx) as the most enriched obesity-altering pathway. Here, we propose to translate these findings to the mammalian context through completion of three aims: i. generation and characterization of 8 PcG conditional knockout mouse lines, ii. dissection of the functional roles of PcG in adipose tissue differentiation, function and disease, and iii. building of a functionally interrogated unbiased epigenetic map of the PcG-system for murine and human obesity. To achieve these goals we will combine targeted mouse genetics, complex phenotyping and state-of-the-art integrative bioinformatics.Using this unique functional-genetics-to-epigenomics approach we will provide an unprecedented functionally validated genomics resource for obesity research worldwide, unravel an entire regulatory niveau in obesity, and if we are lucky, highlight novel therapeutic strategies for metabolic disease.

Recent advances in genomic diagnostic technologies have revealed that disruption of genes involved in transcriptional regulation is a leading cause of IDD. Genes encoding the chromatin remodelling BAF swi/snf complex are among the most commonly mutated. Filling the knowledge gap between mutation and disease will contribute to improved patient care and to our overall understanding of human brain development. To that end, I will bridge the clinical and neurodevelopmental biology fields using patient-phenotype informed cellular models to investigate the molecular underpinnings of disease. I will perform deep-phenotyping of a cohort of patients with BAF-complex mutations, and correlate clinical and psychometric features with gene expression and epigenetic signatures in primary tissues. Alongside this clinical study, I will investigate the specific role of ARID1A, an essential BAF complex subunit, in neurodevelopment. Those investigations, performed in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models of human neurodevelopment, will inform subsequent studies in iPSCs generated from patients. Detailed understanding of clinical outcomes will improve patient management, and integrating the cellular and molecular defects in in vitro models with clinical and molecular phenotypes in patients will help establish predictive preclinical models for translational research.

Liquid biopsy like circulating tumour DNA and circulating tumour cells in the blood has the potential to offer opportunities for non-invasive cancer diagnostics based on real-time monitoring of the evolving cancer genome. Current research in the field has focused on methods to analyse genetic changes in plasma DNA of cancer patients, and has demonstrated the potential for patient stratification, treatment response monitoring and detecting acquired resistance mechanisms during cancer treatment. The proposed project aims to establish new collaboration and develop new methods to analyse cell-free tumour DNA and circulating tumour cells, including approaches for epigenetic analysis and single-cell analysis. These approaches have the potential to extend the application of non-invasive cancer diagnostics to allow more comprehensive understanding of the evolving cancer genome using liquid biopsy to improve cancer care.

There are several classical examples of metaplasia such as gastric intestinal metaplasia, squamous metaplasia of the lung and columnar metaplasia of the oesophagus or Barrett’s syndrome. Barrett’s syndrome (BS) is considered as a precancerous lesion at the origin of oesophageal adenocarcinoma (AdC) that increases by around 50 times the risk of this cancer. The incidence of AdC has been multiplied by 4 in the United States over the past four decades and they represent now more than half of oesophageal cancers in US and Europe. It is therefore crucial to understand the origin of Barrett’s syndrome and oesophageal cancers. Understanding the mechanisms involved in metaplasia, oesophageal cancer initiation and progression will be the key to elucidating the causes for esophageal cancer and thus the cornerstone of developing new therapeutic strategies. The aim of this project is to use state of the art lineage tracing experiments to characterize the homeostasis of squamous oesophageal and squamo-columnar junction cells to identify the cells at the origin of oesophageal cancers. Taking advantage of the lineage specific expression of both oncogene (PI3Kca or Smo) and fluorescent reporter, we will characterize the molecular events associated to oesophagus carcinogenesis by using transcriptional and epigenetic profiling by RNA and ATAC sequencing respectively. The results to these experiments will allow the identification of key regulators of Barrett’s syndrome and Adenocarcinoma. For the best candidates, we will perform gene knocked down in vitro and knockout in vivo to determine their impact on tumour initiation and growth.

Recent whole-genome and epigenome profiling studies in CLL reveal that enhancer elements not only show massive DNA methylation changes but are also subjected to non-coding mutations. These findings suggest that (epi)genetic alterations of enhancers may modify their activity leading to differential expression of target genes. As such, enhancer alterations may represent a new generation of drivers in CLL pathogenesis. The global aim of this proposal is to investigate the clinico-biological impact of (epi)genetic changes of enhancers in CLL. We will initially characterize the epigenome of CLL samples from the Spanish CLL Genome Consortium to extend the small series generated in the European Blueprint Project. Then, we will precisely analyze the impact of DNA methylation and non-coding genetic variants on the activity level of enhancers defined by specific histone marks (H3K4me1 and H3K27ac) by ChIP-seq and chromatin accessibility by ATAC-seq in the very same cases. For candidate regions in which the DNA methylation level or mutational status correlates with enhancer activity, we will initiate functional analyses using a custom CRISPR-guide RNA library to disrupt the selected enhancers and measure their downstream transcriptional effects in CLL cell lines. Subsequently, individual disruption or mutation of enhancers using specific CRISPR vectors will allow us to measure their downstream biological effects and 4C-seq experiments will allow us to link enhancers to genes. Furthermore, the impact of genetic or epigenetic changes in enhancer activity will be additionally evaluated for a subset regions using by luciferase experiments. Finally, we will study the clinical impact of (epi)genetic changes in functionally-relevant enhancer regions. This integrative analysis shall lead to novel insights into CLL pathogenesis and evolution as well as provide new biomarkers with unprecedented clinical value and potential therapeutic targets.

1225	Dr. Eszter KAPUSI	University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna	None	2015-09-01	2018-10-31	Analyse of the characteristics of phiC31 integrase-mediated minicircle generation	Several platforms exist for controlled genomic engineering (e.g. polymerases, restriction enzymes, site-specific recombinases, transposases, zink finger nucleases, TALENs etc.). Site-specific recombination systems became an efficient tool for the precise in vivo modification of eukaryotic genomes. They are mainly used in animal systems and mammalian cells, but receive increasing attention in plants. In the case of directly repeated recognition sites, the recombination reaction results in the loss of the intervening DNA and a circular molecule is formed from the excised fragment. Constructs very similar to the circular DNA generated by site-specific recombinases are applied in the field of minicircles to enhance expression of the gene-of-interest and obtain high yields of various recombinant proteins. The use of small episomal circles, lacking redundant bacterial sequences, may minimize the risk of DNA methylation leading to epigenetic changes, and hereby silencing of the gene-of-interest. Strikingly, the episomal circle might exist autonomously in the cell after the recombination reaction, and is not necessarely subjected to an immediate cellular degradation after its emergence. However, little is known about its ‘in vivo’ behavior in plant systems. The currently available information is insufficient to determine the fate of the removed nuclear sequence after recombinase-mediated excision. This issue is important because a persistence of the excised products in somatic cells may pose biosafety concerns. If the episomal circle proves to be stable and persistent in dividing cells, one cannot rule out the possibility that it is passed on to successive generations of the organism. In order to reveal the potential of plant minicircles to enhance target gene expression and to reach a high practicability in applied systems, it is necessary to analyze the associated mechanisms, such as episomal excision circle formation, stability and monitoring its transgene expression. Therefore, to understand the consequences of the site-specific recombination reaction, the proposed project reveals a strong indication for extensive further analyses of recombinase-mediated site-specific excision. This can be achieved via tracing the episomal circle generated by the phiC31 integrase in plants. According to preliminary experiments, the target chromosomal segment removed by a site-specific recombinase, the phiC31 integrase, remains stable in barley. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana and barley (Hordeum vulgare) cv. ‘Golden Promise’ will be used as model systems to achieve the goals using molecular methods and two fluorescent reporter proteins for tracking the process of phiC31 integrase-mediated site-specific excision, determine the exact timepoint of the minicircle formation and monitor its fate in the cells. The results will be of great value for the fields of biosafety and the possible application of the system for enhanced recombinant protein expression.

The vast majority of initiation events of RNA polymerase II in the mouse and human genome occur at CG rich promoters, so called CpG islands (CGI). This class of regulatory elements provides a central hub for proximal gene regulation in mammals where key activating and repressing signals converge. Nevertheless, it remains to be investigated if and how their CG density is involved in their genetic and epigenetic regulation. Here we propose to use novel tools of quantitative genomics to study comprehensively the constituents that act in cis and in trans to activate CGI promoters. In addition we will ask how the Polycomb system is targeted to CGI promoters and how it functions in their transient repression.Through genomic mapping and genetic deletion we will determine binding and function of DNA and chromatin binding factors involved in regulating CGIs. In order to systematically test the regulatory logic of CGIs we will establish a high throughput reporter assay enabling us to quantify the transcriptional activity of thousands of synthesized promoter haplotypes at a defined chromosomal locus. This will help to decode the regulation of CGIs and to better understand how natural sequence variation influences their activity. Together this integrative project will apply new genome editing and genomics approaches to shed light on an important class of regulatory regions in mammalian genomes.

The underlying mechanisms are still almost completely unknown and there are no drugs that can cure the disease. In addition to traditional genetics, recent work in Parkinson’s has focussed on epigenetic variation, in particular DNA methylation in the brain. However, even though different brain cell types are affected by Parkinson’s in different ways, all previous work has only considered bulk brain tissue consisting of a mixture of cell types. For the first time, this project will determine the DNA methylation profile in individual cell types of the prefrontal cortex in both people with Parkinson’s and matched controls. In particular, this will include separate analysis of neurons, oligodendrocytes and other glial cells. This will generate pilot data that will lead to several large (>£1M) follow-up grant applications, including not only studies of DNA methylation, but single-cell-type investigations of other epigenetic marks such as histone modifications and non-coding RNAs. The hope is that this approach will lead to a step change in the mechanistic understanding of Parkinson’s disease, and produce a host of new potential drug targets.

Similarly, they may explain how genetically identical organisms are capable of adapting to distinct environmental conditions. Yet, the molecular mechanisms regulating how epigenetic traits can be inherited during cell division or across generations are not fully understood. Using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we have recently revealed how the nuclear Argonaute protein CSR-1 and its associated short RNAs participate in global transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization. This unprecedented observation opened up a new class of molecular mechanisms by which Argonaute proteins and their bound short RNAs may actively contribute to epigenetic inheritance in animals. This research proposal focuses on the characterization of short-RNA-based mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance during animal development and upon environmental changes. Using C. elegans as an animal model system, we plan to integrate genetic, biochemical, and molecular biology tools with high-throughput genomic and proteomic approaches to dissect (i) the molecular mechanism by which CSR-1-bound short RNAs regulate transcription, (ii) test their ability in propagating the memory of actively transcribed genomic regions during early embryonic development, and (iii) characterize their role in propagating the memory of stress responses across generations to facilitate the adaptation of animals to environmental changes. Given the association of nuclear Argonaute proteins with transcriptionally active loci in metazoans, we anticipate that similar CSR-1-like epigenetic functions are also conserved in humans. Therefore, our research has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying epigenetic inheritance and reveals their impact on animal development and adaptation to changing environments.

This genetic information programs how and when genes will be expressed within the diverse number of cells of an organism. Epigenetic mechanisms such as chromatin and DNA modifications give rise to heritable gene expression changes without affecting the DNA code. Research in epigenetics led to the discoveries of novel gene regulatory mechanisms with heritable features. A similar paradigm has now emerged with RNA. RNA carries the message encoded in the DNA. Yet this message itself can also be altered by chemical modifications. There are currently more than 150 diverse modifications found on RNA and a greater number of proteins are required for their biogenesis and recognition. Recent discoveries have shown that RNA modifications can be dynamically regulated and they have been implicated in embryonic development, longevity, neurological diseases and cancers in humans and in animal models. The heritable nature of epigenetic mechanisms requires gene expression changes within the germ cells, which give rise to the offspring. Germline development, germ cell proliferation and identity are essential for the survival of organisms. Epigenetic mechanisms play key roles in genome defence by targeting foreign elements and they also prevent somatic gene expression in the germ cells. Still, in some animals, it is possible to reprogram the epigenetic pathways to establish heritable gene expression changes that can last many generations. The biological role of most RNA modifications remains unclear in multicellular organisms and their role in heritable gene expression regulation is not explored. Research using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as an animal model made pioneering contributions to the discovery and understanding of epigenetic gene regulatory pathways in animal germlines. Up until recently, the RNA modification landscape of C. elegans was not know. In order to establish C. elegans as a model system to study the role of RNA modifications, I developed mass spectrometry methods that enable the identification and quantification of modified RNAs. Using these methods, I showed that several RNA modifications found in C. elegans show changes upon stress such as dietary restriction or high temperatures. In some instances, these changes in RNA modifications can be reversed. My research aims to uncover the role of a specific group of RNA modifications that contain a methyl group. By understanding how RNA methylations contribute to gene expression changes in germ cells, I aim to discover their epigenetic functions. Using a combination of biochemical and genetic methods, I will (i) develop an enzyme specific sequencing method for methylated RNAs (ii) study the role of RNA methylations in animal germ cells (iii) investigate how RNA methylome itself is regulated by dietary metabolism This research is important because, first the proposed sequencing method will benefit a large research community and enable the profiling of RNA methylations in multicellular organisms. Second, understanding the role of RNA modifications in germ cells will reveal their role in cell proliferation and differentiation that will benefit research in human diseases such as cancer and fertility. And finally, my research has the potential to pioneer a new research direction on how our diet can affect gene expression through RNA modifications.	Medical Research Council	Fellowship	1224902.0	GBP

We hypothesize that the TET1/2/3 pathway governs some aspects of the stem cell-like epigenetic landscape of CSCs by depositing 5meC and 5hmC modifications on stem cell loci partly overlapping with hPSCs. Our objective is uncovering unique 5meC and 5hmC fingerprints on stem cell loci and the role of TET1/2/3 in CSCs, followed by proof-of-concept data for detecting PDACs based on these novel epigenetic signatures in PDAC patient versus healthy blood samples. The project has three sub-aims: 1. Characterising 5meC and 5hmC landscapes in pancreatic CSCs and hPSCs for uncovering unique epigenetic signatures common to these cell types. 2. Performing CRISPR-mediated knockdowns of TET1/2/3 for uncovering their phenotypic effects in pancreatic CSCs. 3.

Interactions between diet, gut microbiota, altered mucosal and systemic immunity and host metabolism have been strongly implicated, but have not been systematically studied. In addition, approximately 10 to15% of patients with NAFLD will progress to develop non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and around 5% will develop cirrhosis. The factors determining individual susceptibility to develop NASH are also incompletely understood but genetic factors account for about one-third of the variance. NAFLD is a significant emergent cause of liver disease in India. These population show distinct differences in body composition compared to their Caucasian counterparts, in particular, they have a significantly higher percentage body fat for given body weight. In this proposal, we adopt a systems medicine approach to interrogate the factors associated with NAFLD development and progression in India, and to explore its pathophysiology. Currently available information on basic demography, life style factors, physical findings, and laboratory test results in 1200 NAFLD cases and 4,200 controls will be combined with new information on liver stiffness (Fibroscan), as a measure of disease progression, and the results of genome-wide and epigenome-wide association studies in order to identify risk factors for NAFLD and its progression. Insights into disease pathogenesis will be provided by undertaking faecal metagenomics and targeted bacterial metabolite profiling in urine/plasma/stool, immune cell characterisation with an emphasis on innate and mucosal immunity and functional studies to determine the effects of bacterial metabolites on immune cell phenotype.

By a combination of robust epigenetic analyses and finely-tuned molecular experiments we will address the following objectives: (i) dissecting the BTK-responsive enhancer landscape in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) (ii) modelling the epigenetic and transcriptional temporal dynamics of BTKi-resistance (iii) elucidating the specificity of BTK-responsive epigenome and identifying novel biomarkers for BTKi resistance Over the last year our knowledge regarding the chromatin landscape in CLL has exponentially grown and histone modification states have emerged as a vital component of CLL biology. In parallel with the progress on epigenomics, the treatment paradigm in CLL is shifting from nonspecific chemo/immunotherapy to targeted therapies, of which Ibrutinib has shown remarkable efficacy. Given the emerging importance of chromatin landscape in CLL, we hypothesized that BTKi may affect transcriptional dynamics by a shift on histone marks profiles. We have recently shown that H3K27ac patterns are distinct between pre- and post- Ibrutinib CLL patients and we provided first evidence that BTKi effects at the cellular level can be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms involving rewiring of distinct enhancer loci. The proposed work will build upon these data in order to elucidate the role of epigenomics in BTKi resistance for 1st/2nd generation BTKi and to discover stratification biomarkers. These outcomes can significantly contribute to tailored treatment decisions and pave the way for epigenetically-relevant combinatorial therapies.

In addition we wish to follow up on our observations on the semaphorins and their receptors through a studentship. Our small pathology laboratory (Project 5) will continue to support tissue analysis for the above projects, and those with our collaborators.

We are proposing one new area, which brings together the current group’s expertise in breast cancer with Dr Hamilton’s expertise in RNA interference, to investigate siRNA directed epigenetic gene silencing of tumour suppressor genes in breast cancer. For this we are requesting an additional postdoctoral scientist and a technician. After only three years a number of interesting leads have been identified. We have had to make difficult choices and have decided not to pursue our work on transcription factors, but to concentrate on mammary gland biology and breast cancer, where we have more expertise. TSC22 will be followed up in collaboration with Kevin Ryan at the Beatson Institute and Bruce Whitelaw at the Roslin Institute, through alternative sources of funding. Overall there will be 5 projects, including: Project 1: The role of the Reelin pathway in mammary gland development and breast cancer. Project 2: Annexin A8 in mammary gland development and breast cancer. Project 3: The Role Of RNA Interference In Epigenetic Silencing In Breast Cancer.

Although epigenetic changes, and in particular of DNA methylation (DNAm), have been linked with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, with findings opening novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets, they have not been studied in DLB. This pilot study aims to explore the role of neuronal DNAm changes in DLB by combining laser-capture microdissection (LCM), for isolation of specific neurons affected by pathology, with genome-wide DNAm analysis using reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS). Our hypothesis is that DLB pathogenesis is associated with distinct epigenetic changes that can help to identify therapeutic targets. We also hypothesise that neurons bearing Lewy body pathology have a specific epigenetic signature compared to unaffected ones. To address our hypotheses this pilot project aims to: 1. Optimize and test the methodology for LCM of specific neurons from post-mortem brain suitable for DNAm analysis. 2. Combine LCM with RRBS for neuronal methylomic profiling of DLB cases and matched controls 3. Compare methylomic profiles of affected by Lewy Body pathology neurons with unaffected neurons within each individual 4. Identify methylation quantitative trait loci in DLB by combining methylomic profiling with available genomic data 5. Associate methylation changes with ante-mortem cognitive and neuroimaging data The analyses will focus both on known risk genes that have been previously linked with DLB (e.g SNCA) and on genome-wide analyses for identification of novel targets. Data gathered from this project will be the basis for future larger scale work.	The Academy of Medical Sciences	None	29668.0	GBP

Key in understanding cellular specification is to elucidate the epigenetic mechanism that underlies transcriptional heterogeneity. Thus a central question in biology is how cell-to-cell variability in the epigenome contributes to the emergence of phenotypic differences. However, current techniques to profile the epigenome require populations of cells and consequently present ensemble averages of the underlying biology. Therefore, to grasp the molecular concept behind the cellular acquisition of heritable traits it is essential to develop techniques to profile the epigenome at the single-cell level. The advent of single-cell genomics enabled profiling of few epigenetic features and transcriptomics in single cells; however, this toolbox is still very restricted and moreover, to directly correlate the variability in the epigenome to changes in gene-expression activity it is pivotal to device methods to obtain both measurements from the same cell. Therefore, to bridge these shortcomings in the epigenetic toolbox, we plan to develop and apply novel techniques to profile the epigenome in single cells. With this proposal we aim to (1) develop a method to map histone modifications in single cells (2) develop a method to map chromatin organization in single cells (3) develop a method to obtain combined measurements of the epigenome and the transcriptome of the same cell (4) apply these and previously developed single-cell methods, to different biological systems to study how the epigenome contributes to lineage specification. Collectively, the goal of this proposal is to develop a comprehensive single-cell toolbox to take the field to the next (epigenomic) level and to work towards elucidating the molecular mechanism behind cellular specification.

The phenotypic association between severe mental illness and cardio-metabolic traits is bidirectional. Recent advances in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have shown that common genetic loci play an important role in the aetiology of these complex traits. A growing body of evidence suggest that common loci associated with complex traits act through effects on gene regulation, such as epigenetic effects. The aim of the proposed research is to investigate the associations between severe mental illness and cardio-metabolic traits using a prediction modelling approach incorporating phenotypic, and (epi)genetic data. This will be achieved by considering the following aims: 1. Use a prediction modelling approach to examine which cardio-metabolic traits best predict clinical outcomes, prognosis and treatment response in severe mental illness. 2. I will use GWAS and methylation data to examine the shared genetic architecture between severe mental illness and cardio-metabolic traits. Following this I will use Mendelian randomization to examine the direction of effect. 3. I will utilise the information from objective 1 & 2 to combine polygenic risk scores, environmental factors and blood biomarkers for cardio-metabolic traits to predict clinical outcomes, prognosis and treatment response in severe mental illness. In all three objectives I will use data from population based cohorts such as UK Biobank, GS and ELSA, clinical disease ascertained samples and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, as well as data from electronic health records both here at Kings and at the University of Bristol. These objectives move forward precision medicine by combining genetic and environmental risk factors and blood biomarkers to detect those at high risk for cardio-metabolic traits early in the course of severe mental illness and would inform the choice of medication or preventive strategies, thereby reducing the burden of cardio-metabolic traits in severe mental illness.

One of the fundamental biological characteristics of almost any AML is clonal heterogeneity. Recently, a novel genomic classification has been proposed with “TP53 mutations, chromosomal aneuploidy or both” being a distinct AML subentity revealing an exceedingly adverse prognosis. TP53 mutations are initial events of leukemogenesis that characterize preleukemic stem cells (preLSCs) as described recently by our group. However, in clinical and biological studies performed so far, TP53 mutations were analyzed as a dichotomous variable or constituted clonal events with a variant allele frequency (VAF) of >40%. Here, we hypothesize that in AML, subclonal TP53 mutations are also indicators of a dismal outcome, confer properties of preLSCs/leukemic stem cells (LSCs) and expand during the course of the disease. “Aim I” of the project will focus on the clinical impact of small TP53 mutated clones as a novel biomarker using well characterized cohorts of the German-Austrian AML Study Group (AMLSG). In particular, we will use data from 1540 prospectively treated AML patients whose leukemia specimens were characterized previously by targeted deep sequencing for mutations in 110 candidate genes. Furthermore, to evaluate the impact of very small TP53 mutated clones, we will analyze specimens of patients enrolled in a population-based AML registry study by ultrasensitive mutation analysis allowing detection of VAFs of <0.1%. In “Aim II”, we will elaborate the biological behavior of small TP53 mutated clones in AML. A novel, humanized ossicle xenograft mouse model showing significantly improved engraftment rates as compared to NSG/NSGS mice will be used to study whether human AML cells with small TP53 mutated clones exhibit preLSC/LSC properties. To interrogate the clonal architecture of these AML specimens, in vitro colony-forming assays derived from single sorted hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells will be analyzed. Data derived from this project will provide novel insights into the clonal complexity of AML and, furthermore, may define subclonal TP53 mutations as important biomarker in AML necessitating adjustment of therapeutic approaches. As TP53 mutations are found in the majority of human malignancies, the results obtained will also have implications for other fields in hematology/oncology.

Karoline KOLLMANN	University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna	None	2019-05-01	2022-04-30	Linking CDK6 to the epigenome in AML	Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a disease with poor outcomes, due to disease relapse. Leukemic stem cells (LSCs), which are capable of giving rise to identical daughter cells as well as differentiated cells, are important in AML initiation and progression. LSCs have different properties than the bulk AML population, making them difficult to eliminate which is considered to be the root of drug resistance. One hallmark of AML is aberrant DNA methylation patterns. The mechanisms underlying the generation of genomic methylation patterns are still poorly understood. However, a recent study showed ?rst evidence of epigenetic differences between patient LSCs and their non–stem cell progeny. Hypomethylating agents are on the forerun and rational combinations with other drugs can offer the greatest benefit. Due to preliminary data from our group we hypothesize that the cyclin dependent kinase CDK6 influences the epigenetic landscape and that CDK6 kinase activity alters therapeutic responsiveness towards epigenetic agents. For this project we aim to use a murine hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPCLSK) model to mimic cell state heterogeneity in a genetically defined setting of AML subtypes. This model allows us to analyze LSCs as well as their non-stem cell progeny. We will get deeper insights in which AML subtypes and cell states show epigenetic changes due to CDK6 inhibition by using Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin Sequencing (ATAC-Seq) analysis. By performing proteomics analysis of total and phosphorylated proteins we will determine which epigenetic modifiers are regulated by CDK6. Furthermore we will determine if these changes account for an enhanced sensitivity to small molecules targeting epigenetic modifiers evaluated as CDK6 targets. These findings will be validated in human patient samples in vitro and in vivo. Palbociclib as well as several epigenetic drugs have been FDA approved and are widely used in clinical studies what makes novel therapeutic combinations very attractive. The proposed project will address two key issues: (i) if LSCs and/or their non-stem cell pool of AML subtypes show changes in their epigenetic landscape and epigenetic modulators due to CDK6 kinase inhibition and (ii) if these changes lead to novel therapeutic vulnerabilities with combinations of epigenetic agents and Palbociclib.

The next big challenge to understand gene behaviour is deciphering (a) how the genome is organized in space and (b) how this organization influences its function. Inside Eukaryotic cells, genomic DNA is packed together with proteins into a remarkable structure known as chromatin. Nucleosomes, the building blocks of chromatin, interact with each other to enable high-density packaging. Our understanding of chromatin structure is limited by the lack of ‘close up views’ and molecular-level mechanistic information of how nucleosome interactions are regulated in vivo by many highly coupled factors. InsideChromatin aims to develop a groundbreaking multiscale approach that will push the current limits of realistic computational modelling of in vivo chromatin structure. The vision is to achieve the first multiscale simulation study that describes nucleosome organization inside functionally different kilobase-scale domains, while explicitly accounting for the combination of epigenetic marks, the binding of architectural proteins, and nucleosome remodelling activity that distinguishes each domain. InsideChromatin will integrate atomistic simulations with two levels of coarse-graining and experimental data for validation to understand how nucleosome organization at kilobase scales leads to physical properties at megabase scales. The output from InsideChromatin will bring us closer to the ‘holy grail’ of deciphering the connection between genome characteristics, structure, and function.

It proposes new formal models and a systematic agenda to empirically test hypotheses that link developmental biology, epigenetics and adult human illness, disability and mortality. We seek to break new ground developing innovative formal models for illnesses and mortality, testing new hypotheses about the evolution of human health and, to the extent permitted by findings, reformulating standard theories to make them applicable to a less restrictive segment of populations than they are now. Over the past two decades there has been massive growth of research on the nature of delayed adult effects of conditions experienced in early life. This field of research is known as the Developmental Origins of Adult Health and Disease (DOHaD). Increasing evidence suggests that the mechanisms that are implicated are epigenetic and constitute an evolved adaptation selected over thousands of years to improve fitness in changing landscapes. The emergence of DOHaD is as close as we will ever come to a paradigmatic shift in the study of human health, disability and mortality. The most tantalizing possibility is that advances in our understanding of epigenetic mechanisms will shed light on pathways linking early exposures and delayed adult health thus fundamentally transforming our understanding of human illnesses and, in one fell swoop, bridge population health, epigenetics, and developmental and evolutionary biology. The overarching goal of this project is to contribute to this nascent area of study by (a) proposing new formal demographic models of health, disability and mortality; (b) empirically testing DOHaD predictions with population data; (c) testing a microsimulation model to verify DOHaD predictions about two conditions, obesity and Type 2 Diabetes, and (d) assessing the adult health, disability and mortality toll implicated by relations between early conditions, obesity and T2D.

However, use of these new therapies is limited due to development of acquired resistance. To fully understand how resistance develops, patient-derived models are an absolute pre-requisite, but establishing them remains extremely challenging. Few groups worldwide have successfully implemented a systematic standardized approach to facilitate translational cancer research discovery. My project aims to provide rational therapeutic guidance for combinatorial or adaptive designs to overcome acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in patients with oncogene-addiction. By establishing new laboratory models of resistance directly from patient biopsies (patient derived cell lines and xenografts) I will elucidate the molecular mechanisms whereby cancer cells escape targeted treatments. I will then implement innovative approaches to overcome resistance using TKI combinatorial screens, apoptosis sensitizers and by screening for epigenetic modifiers. Additionally, I will scrutinize the emergence of resistance acquisition in vitro. Current working models involve “persistor” cellular populations able to tolerate the TKI and, in a subsequent step, to become fully resistant to the drug. This drug tolerant persistor stage most probably involves epigenetic reprogrammation. An epigenetic inhibitor screen will be performed to identify agents able to interfere with the emergence of persistors and ultimately with the acquisition of TKI resistance. These results should provide an alternative strategy to validate innovative combinatorial drug strategies to avoid emergence of resistance in patients.

Although TMD usually disappears spontaneously, acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) develops subsequently in 20% of these individuals within the first 4 years of life. Both TMD and AMKL are associated with GATA1 somatic mutations resulting in the production of the truncated protein GATA1s. Our goal is to determine the origin of the DS-TMD/AMKL. The perinatal onset of DS-TMD/AMKL suggests an early developmental emergence of the progenitor population responsible for the disease. Using induced human pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) from a DS-TMD patient to recapitulate embryonic development, we found that cells sharing characteristics of yolk sac (YS)-derived erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMP) but not YS-derived primitive progenitors, model the disease in vitro. Compared to Tri21 control, the EMP-like population carrying the GATA1- truncating mutation (Tri21-G1s) generated a larger number of megakaryocytic progenitors that failed to undergo terminal differentiation. Similarly, Tri21-G1s erythroid cells showed a complete block in maturation. In addition, in Tri21 EMP-like cells, the chemical inhibition of the GATA1-interacting epigenetic regulator LSD1, phenocopies the erythroid blockage observed in isogenic Tri21-G1s cells. This suggests that GATA1s exerts its effect at the epigenetic level by modulating LSD1 activity. Using a combination of state-of-the-art stem cells assays with ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq analysis, we will test the compelling hypothesis of a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-independent origin for DS-TMD/AMKL and we will study the cooperation between Tri21 and GATA1 in the context of the relevant cell population for the DS-TMD/ AMKL. Therefore, our ability to accurately model hematopoietic development with hiPSCs will enable us to understand the ontogeny of DS-TMD/AMKL. We will study this through the following 2 aims: 1) To determine the cellular origin of DS-TMD/AMKL; 2) To characterize at the molecular level GATA1s-induced DS-leukemogenesis.

If not diagnosed early can lead to death. Currently, there are no reliable ways to assess the clinical outcomes or response to treatment. Cancer development shares many similarities with embryo development. A group of genes belonging to the HOX family are major regulators of embryonic development. Our previous work on these genes in mouth cancer have shown changes in its expression due to chemical modification. Additional studies on how these alterations may influence key events in mouth cancer may indicate their potential role for prediction and specific treatment.

The acquisition of immunological memory to infection is a hallmark of protective immunity. Rare and specialized memory T cells called the cytotoxic CD4+ T cells (CD4-CTLs) have been reported to form protective immune response against various viral infections (dengue, Influenza, HIV). Vaccinations against viral infections have shown to elicit a strong CD4-CTL response. In this project, we aim to investigate molecular features and pathogen specificities of human CD4-CTLs. These studies will aid in unraveling the biology of CD4-CTLs and pave the way for developing strategies to boost durable CD4-CTL immune responses following vaccination against viral infections and virally induced cancers.

Enhancers, regulatory elements that direct spatiotemporal gene expression, are the most variably methylated regions in the genome, but the functional consequences of these alterations are not known. Enhancer DNAme has been associated with both gene repression and gene activation, but the majority of studies are correlative or focus on single loci and a systematic analysis is currently lacking. I aim to use a novel reporter-screen based approach together with cutting-edge (epi)genomics approaches (capture Hi-C, ChIP-seq, RNA-seq) to determine whether DNA methylation affects (1) enhancer activity and (2) enhancer-promoter looping interactions in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). I will determine the functional effects of enhancer methylation using in vitro differentiation assays and by generating chimeric embryos. Genome wide methylation will be perturbed using DNA methyltransferase knockout cells whilst locus-specific manipulation will be achieved using epigenetic editing techniques (dCas9-TET1 fusion proteins). The proposed research will generate valuable datasets for the fields of epigenetics and development and the principles discovered will be applicable to developmental biology and other scenarios where DNAme is substantially altered, including cancer and aging.

1246	Dr Tianyi Zhang	MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences	None	2019-08-01	2023-07-31	Role of the transcription factor Ikaros in shaping chromatin dynamics of gene activation and repression	In multicellular organisms, lineage-specific transcription factors (TFs) initiate gene expression programmes that direct differentiation and confer distinct cellular identities. This requires regulation of the chromatin environment involving specific changes in chromatin accessibility, epigenetic modification, and chromatin contacts at regulatory regions. The molecular basis through which TFs drive these processes to activate some target genes and repress others is not fully understood. This project studies how the haematopoietic TF Ikaros binds target elements and modulates chromatin to establish the precise transcriptional programmes required for B-cell differentiation. Key goals are 1) understand how the arrangement of Ikaros binding-motifs at regulatory elements interplays with Ikaros dimerisation/multimerisation to regulate binding 2) determine if recruitment of the chromatin remodeller CHD4 by Ikaros is required for chromatin accessibility and transcription and 3) identify the factors recruited by Ikaros which mediate gene activation or repression. A combination of single-molecule FRET, genomics, and biochemical/proteomics techniques in conjunction with the availability of mutants will be employed to address these aims. Mechanistic insight into Ikaros function will be a basis towards our understanding of the general principles through which TFs direct transcription and pathways critical for normal B-cell differentiation that are dysregulated in B-cell malignancies.

Physical conflicts between the transcription and DNA replication machineries are a potent endogenous source of this instability. My preliminary data indicate that a single collision can trigger long-term epigenetic changes and affect the normal expression state of genes. I hypothesize that collisions can rewire gene expression networks and lead to cellular transformations relevant to disease and development. Unfortunately, this mechanism is largely understudied owing to the lack of suitable cellular systems to characterize collisions in molecular detail. My proposal will address this key gap in knowledge. I recently pioneered a unique human cell-based episomal system to analyse collisions in an inducible and localized fashion. Using this highly tractable system, we will molecularly characterize the (epi)genetic consequences and identify novel factors that prevent or resolve collisions (Aim 1). To address the relevance of collisions in disease, we will establish a novel proximity-labelling system (Split-APEX2) to map collision sites and identify their associated genetic and chromatin changes in a breast cancer cell model. This cutting-edge technology will decipher their role in pathological transformations observed in breast cancer genomes (Aim 2). To link collisions to developmental transformations, we will determine their potential to induce local epigenetic changes during zygotic genome activation in mouse embryonic cells. This approach can shift the paradigm how cells in development first start to differ from each other and reprogram their genome into different cell types (Aim 3). Uncovering the key principles of collisions may implement highly innovative approaches to avoid or establish cellular transformations in disease and development.

A significant observation is that although this infectionmay result in a self-limiting upper respiratory infection or mild pneumonia in some patients, other patientsexperience progression of respiratory symptoms to requirement of intubation for mechanical respiratorysupport and death due to severe respiratory failure. This clinical observation strongly suggests that differencesin host immunologic response are the determinative factor in clinical outcome. We hypothesize that theproposed systems immunology, biostatistical and computational modeling approaches, coupled with detailedclinical phenotype of hospitalized COVID-19 patients will provide a new framework to interpret the interplaybetween SARS-CoV-2 virus and the host, and the relationship with clinical outcome. Project 1 will assess thefrequency and function of SARS-CoV-2 virus antigen specific T cells and evaluate their breadth and clonalityof their TCR repertoire with clinical outcome. Project 2 will determine epigenetic signatures of the immuneresponse to the SARS-CoV-2 virus across short, middle and long-term times and identify DNA methylation-based markers of anti-viral immunity and clinical outcome. With this approach, we will create a unique resourceof highly annotated longitudinal data on SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, which will enable the development ofnovel diagnostic strategies and therapeutics to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.

Solving this issue is a fundamental challenge of evolutionary ecology with implications for applied sciences such as conservation, and agronomy. Non genetic inheritance (NGI; e.g., ecological niche transmission) is suspected to play a foremost role in adaptive evolution but such hypothesis remains untested. Using quantitative genetics in wild plant populations, experimental evolution, and epigenetics, we will assess the role of NGI in the adaptive response to selection of plant populations. The ANGI project will follow the subsequent research program: (1) Using long-term survey data, we will measure natural selection in wild populations of Antirrhinum majus within its heterogeneous array of micro-habitats. We will calculate the fitness gain provided by multiple traits and stem elongation to plants growing in bushes where they compete for light. Stem elongation is known to depend on epigenetic variation. (2) Using a statistical approach that we developed, we will estimate the quantitative genetic and non genetic heritability of traits. (3) We will identify phenotypic changes caused by fitness that are based on genetic variation and NGI and assess their respective roles in adaptive evolution. (4) In controlled conditions, we will artificially select for increased stem elongation in clonal lineages, thereby excluding DNA variation. We will quantify the non genetic response to selection and test for a quantitative epigenetic signature of selection. (5) We will build on our results to generate an inclusive theory of genetic and non genetic natural selection. ANGI builds on a confirmed expertise in selection experiments, quantitative genetics and NGI. In addition, the availability of survey data provides a solid foundation for the achievement of this project. Our ambition is to shed light on original mechanisms underlying adaptation that are an alternative to genetic selection.	European Research Council	Consolidator Grant	1999970.0	EUR

Despite recent progress, adaptation is to date a poorly understood process largely due to limitations of current approaches that focus (i) on a priori candidate genes, (ii) on signals of selection at the DNA level without functional validation of the identified candidates, and (iii) on small sets of adaptive mutations that do not represent the variability present in natural populations. As a result, major questions such as what is the relative importance of different types of mutations in adaptation?, and what is the importance of epigenetic changes in adaptive evolution?, remain largely unanswered. To gain a deep understanding of adaptation, we need to systematically identify adaptive mutations across space and time, pinpoint their molecular mechanisms and discover their fitness effects. To this end, Drosophila melanogaster has proven to be an ideal organism. Besides the battery of genetic tools and resources available, D. melanogaster has recently adapted to live in out of Africa environments. We and others have already shown that transposable elements (TEs) have substantially contributed to the adaptation of D. melanogaster to different environmental challenges. Here, we propose to use state-of-the-art techniques, such as Illumina TruSeq sequencing and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, to systematically identify and characterize in detail adaptive TE insertions in D. melanogaster natural populations. Only by moving from gathering anecdotic evidence to applying global approaches, we will be able to start constructing a quantitative and predictive theory of adaptation that will be relevant for other species as well.

Molecular analysis is able to provide a definitive diagnosis in some patients with inherited SAID, but the results can be inconclusive or even misleading in several other cases. In daily practice, the number of patients having a clinical picture highly consistent with an autoinflammatory disease, but are orphan of a molecular characterization (undefined SAID) is still high. The main goals of the presented project are: i) to establish consensus among experts on the correct interpretation of genetic tests in accordance with available clinical criteria; ii) to improve the performance of genetic diagnosis; iii) to evaluate the impact of modifier factors in the phenotype of defined SAID, using Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) as a prototype; iv) to establish a multidimensional platform for the identification of new genes and conditions for orphan patients. This project is part of the international collaborative project INSAID. Data and information sharing among the participating groups will be facilitated by establishing a proper common database and by implementing a pilot bioinformatics platform. AIT Molecular Diagnostics will bring in their expertise in genome-wide and targeted analyses of DNA methylation, autoantibody profiling using protein-microarray technology, immune-qPCR for serum-inflammation markers and bioinformatics, to characterise undefined SAID on the epigenetic, immunomics, and inflammatory level of disease molecular pathology. The project integrates three essential ingredients i) well characterized valuable patient material, ii) state-of-the-art genomic approaches and iii) innovative functional assays, which all together are making the most promising approach for the identification of causal DNA variants, new genes and biomarkers in genetically orphan patients.

1252	Dr Jan Zylicz	University of Cambridge	None	2016-07-01	2020-06-30	Role of epigenetic mechanisms in random X chromosome inactivation ex vivo and in vivo.	Developmental progression is linked to accumulation of epigenetic information mainly in the form of chemical modifications of the chromatin. One of the most striking examples of that is random X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in female mammalian embryos. This process is dependent on coating of one X chromosome by a long non-coding RNA, Xist. This in turn promotes rapid and dramatic remodelling of the chromatin. The functional relevance and exact spatio-temporal dynamics of this process remains elusive. Here I propose to address these questions by using an integrated approach. Firstly I will use an ex vivo embryo culture system to monitor the dynamics of XCI. I will further integrate that information with single cell and population based epigenomic to generate in vivo and in vitro datasets accounting to a roadmap for XCI. I aim at identifying the initial stages of epigenetic programming leading to transcriptional repression as well as genomic loci involved in nucleating these changes. I will finally address the functional relevance of X chromosome epigenetic programming by using gene knockout models and genome-wide single cell transcriptomics approach. Such work will have wide-raging implications beyond the field of XCI and can be extrapolated into other epigenetic regulatory mechanisms.

According to traditional view, atherosclerosis results from a passive build-up of cholesterol in the artery wall. Accumulating evidence however, has shown that apart from genetic and epigenetic factors, atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory condition. Danger associated molecular patterns including cholesterol crystals and oxidised LDL appear to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is implicated in disease progression and subsequent risk of Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE). Recent studies, including work carried out by a previous Wellcome Trust vacation scholar, demonstrated that the scavenger receptor CD36 and the endocannabinoid receptor CB1 are involved in the activation and regulation of the NLRP3 inflamamasome in response to either oxidised LDL or high glucose in macrophages. The proposed project will be a continuation of the previous in vitro work supported by the Wellcome Trust, and will investigate and compare the expression and activation levels of the NLRP3 inflammasome and associtated receptors in patient samples at varying levels of MACE risk with controls. The overall aim of the project is to contribute to the development of a novel blood test that would better predict patients risk of MACE above and beyond the currently used prediction tests.

This proposal aims to investigate the role of an overlooked aspect of T cell metabolism, the polyamine synthesis pathway. The importance of polyamine metabolism in T cell proliferation, differentiation and function will be characterised using a conditional T cell murine knockout of the master regulator of polyamine synthesis (ODCflox/flox CD4-Cre). Where the polyamine pathway sits in the T cell metabolic network will be investigated in wildtype and ODC-/- T cells using various metabolomic techniques such as Seahorse, proteomics, and analysis of metabolite uptake/usage. How T cells utilise polyamines to drive cell division and differentiation will centre on the ability of polyamines to directly mediate epigenetic modifications and indirectly influence translation through the polyamine-dependent translation elongation factor eIF5a. Analysis of global acetylation/methylation patterns and gene expression in wildtype and ODC-/- T cells will provide insight as to how polyamines influence gene expression relevant to proliferation and differentiation. Similarly, how these molecules influence the translation of proteins also important for cell division and fate will be investigated through proteomic approaches and analysis of translation in ODC-/- and DOHH-/- (an enzyme required for eIF5a activation) T cells.

A high prevalence of psychopathology has been reported in students in higher education leading to significant impact on their academic success and ability to complete their studies. To assess biological and environmental factors contributing to mental health issues in students, first year students were asked to take part in the Ulster University Student Wellbeing Study. As part of this study, students provided a saliva sample to determine biological risk factors and were asked to complete an online survey on their physical and mental health. Depression was one of the most commonly reported mental health disorders but the biological basis of depression remains poorly understood. There are no clinically validated biomarkers for depression but genetic and epigenetic changes in the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT), which plays an important role in regulation of serotonin and brain derived neurotrophic factor, which plays a vital role in neuronal survival and differentiation, have been associated with depression. The goal of this study is to determine whether polymorphism of the 5-HTTLPR, prevalence of the Val66Met polymorphism of the BDNF gene and DNA methylation in both 5-HTT and BDNF promoter regions are associated with depression in the student population.

Given the enrichment of common disease genetic risk variants within transcriptional enhancers, this gap in knowledge may be limiting our power to prioritise and investigate causal variants that affect liver cell function. Here, we propose to expose human primary hepatocyte spheroids to pathophysiological concentrations of free fatty acids, carbohydrates and insulin, which were previously shown to induce changes in a select number of genes and induce lipogenesis, consistent with a steatosis-like hepatic state. We will apply RNA-seq and ATAC-seq to identify differentially active enhancers in hepatic spheroids with steatosis, which we will link to target genes by correlation analysis. The epigenomic maps will be integrated with metabolic trait genetic association datasets. As proof-of-principle, we will select and target one steatosis-modulated enhancer with CRISPR/Cas9 in human hepatocytes. Functional outcomes will be evaluated by qPCR and intracellular lipid quantification by FACS (BODIPY). This project is intended to provide proof-of-principle evidence that there is rewiring of the hepatic enhancer landscape in NAFLD-associated conditions. Furthermore, it is designed to lay the groundwork for future high-throughput liver cell enhancer functional screens.	The Academy of Medical Sciences	Springboard Round 5	99964.63	GBP

It is one of the most common genetic disorders in the world which affect poor communities in the under developed countries in the tropics including Sri Lanka. Currently there is no cure except for the bone marrow transplantation which is available only to a minority (less than 10%) of patients who have a well-matched sibling donor. Genetic-based therapies and increasingly being evaluated as treatment options for beta-thalassaemia. These include epigenetic drugs as well as genome editing based therapies. Epigenetic drugs are a new group of medicines which were discovered recently and are being tested in clinical trails; a few have obtained US Food and Drug Authority (FDA) approval. This field has triggered substantial interest in treating genetic diseases in general. The proposed network will aid in exchange of knowledge, technology, skills and competencies on molecular genetic-based therapeutic research on thalassaemia among partner countries. More importantly, this will help Sri Lanka to build capacity to perform genetic-based scientific research at its highest caliber. In this project we will evaluate two novel epigenetic therapies (vorinostat and hydroxyurea) as a cure for thalassaemia. This project will let these new cutting edge scientific discoveries which were previously available only to the a fluent communities to reach poor and underdeveloped countries. This project will generate preliminary data for future detailed evaluation of these drugs in patients with thalassaemia and may lead to larger scale clinical trials.

In this process, one of the two X chromosomes in females is converted from an active into a clonally heritable, inactive, state during early embryonic development, to ensure dosage compensation between the sexes. This process is also remarkable in that an entire chromosome is silenced while its homologue, present in the same nucleus, remains active. Thus, in addition to being an epigenetics paradigm, XCI also represents a powerful model for monoallelic gene expression and could provide important insights into the mechanisms underlying other examples of random, monoallelic regulation. The key locus underlying the initiation of XCI is the X-inactivation centre (Xic). The Xic ensures the induction and monoallelic expression of a non-coding RNA (Xist) that is responsible for triggering chromosomal silencing in cis during development. We would like to understand the mechanisms underlying the Xic's functions and define whether other, Xic-like loci exist in the genome. Once XCI is established, the inactive state is initially reversible but becomes progressively locked in as development proceeds due to numerous epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, as well as nuclear compartmentalization and asynchronous replication. In the proposed program, we will exploit our expertise in XCI to develop new lines of research and use novel technologies to investigate monoallelic gene expression, nuclear organization and epigenetics during development. Our main objectives are (1) to understand how monoallelic expression states are established and maintained during early development and (2) to assess how chromosome dynamics and nuclear architecture can impact on these states.

Recent research indicated, however, that their potential to produce bioactive compounds was merely scratched on the surface: the majority of bioactive metabolites still awaits discovery as many biosynthetic pathways remained inactive under laboratory conditions. Spreading (multi-) resistances against medical therapeutics and agrochemicals has therefore renewed the interest in natural products derived from these organisms. The proposed physiological study aims at triggering and preselecting potential new bioactive compounds from Metarhizium brunneum (production strain BIPESCO 5/F 52) and Penicillium ochrochloron CBS123.823. To do this, cultivation conditions of highly controlled and standardized bioreactor cultivations (batch or chemostat) will be modified as follows: (i) different nutrient limitations, (ii) fungal-fungal and fungal-bacterial co-cultivation at different nutrient limitations and (iii) epigenetic perturbation at different nutrient limitations. By correlating metabolic shifts with bioactivity (i.e. cytotoxicity tests and tests against multi-drug resistant microorganisms) followed by dereplication using UHPLC-DAD-QTOF-MS/MS, it will be possible to prioritize potential new bioactive metabolites for later isolation and identification. Inter- and intra-cultivation shifts in the growth profile (e.g. nutritional status of the culture, biomass production, oxygen uptake rates) will give already first detailed information about the conditions this potentially interesting metabolite is produced. Furthermore, this approach will allow a comparison how strategies such as co-cultivation or epigenetic perturbation affect the metabolite spectrum in these organisms differently. A second aim of this study is to explore how these aforementioned different stimuli influence the production of selected medically and biotechnologically interesting metabolites. This includes the novel antibiotic xanthoepocin from P. ochrochloron and 22 different destruxins known to be produced by M. brunneum, of which some are promising anti-cancer agents and have phytotoxic or insecticidal activity. Purified xanthoepocin and selected destruxins will be tested for their cytotoxicity and bioactivity against a broad range of multi-drug resistant pathogens. The results of this study will be of interest for several fields of research including medicinal and agricultural applications and will allow unique new insights into the interplay of fungal metabolite excretion, growth dynamics, nutrient limitations and uptake kinetics, bioactivity, epigenetic perturbation and co-cultivation. Apart from the applicant Dr. Pamela Vrabl and the co-applicant Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Burgstaller, an expert in fungal physiology, several renowned collaboration partners are involved: Dr. Hermann Strasser, an expert in biological pest control, cooperates in all aspects concerning M. brunneum and agreed to co-mentor the applicant together with Prof. Dr. W. Burgstaller. Prof. Dr. H. Stuppner contributes with his experience in natural products chemistry, isolation and analysis. Finally, Prof. Dr. C. Lass-Flörl, a renowned expert in medical microbiology, supports this project by testing the antimicrobial activity.	Austrian Science Fund FWF	Hertha Firnberg Programme	228720.0	EUR

One of the greatest challenges is that breast cancer is a heterogeneous group of 10 diseases defined by genomic profiling. In addition, each tumor is composed of clones and clonal evolution underpins the successive acquisition of the hallmarks of cancer, including metastasis and resistance to therapy. Furthermore tumors display biologically and clinically relevant cellular heterogeneity: immune system, vasculature, and stroma. This cellular heterogeneity both shapes and is shaped by the malignant compartment and modulates response to therapy. This proposal will use longitudinal studies to unravel the clonal and cellular heterogeneity of breast cancer and its dynamic evolution with treatment. The overall goal is to provide a systems level view of evolving clonal and cellular architectures in space and time along the clinical continuum of breast cancers in the clinic, leading to the discovery of new biological and clinical paradigms which will transform our understanding of the disease. The overall approach is to capture the evolution of clonal and cellular heterogeneity of breast cancers in space and time using unique clinical cohorts where samples (biopsies and blood/plasma) are available spanning the whole disease continuum: early breast cancer surgically treated with curative intent, neo-adjuvant therapy, and matched relapse/metastasis. The 4 aims of the proposal are: 1. Characterization of the clonal and cellular heterogeneity of primary tumours from the 10 genomic driver-based breast cancer subtypes (ICs) 2. Comparative characterization of the clonal and cellular heterogeneity of matched pairs of primary and metastatic cancers 3. Characterization of the clonal and epigenetic evolution across therapy courses 4. Characterization of the immune response across therapy courses	European Research Council	Advanced Grant	2497660.0	EUR

Chromatin integrates a multitude of signals to control gene expression, only some of which have the propensity to be maintained through replication and cell division. For our understanding of cellular memory and epigenetic inheritance we need to know what features characterize a stable, heritable chromatin state throughout the cell cycle. State-of-the-art methods such as ChIP-Seq provide population-based snapshots of the epigenomic landscape but little information on the stability and relative importance of each studied feature or modification. This project pioneers a rapid, sensitive and selective protein labeling method (termed RAPID) for capturing genome-wide chromatin dynamics resolved over a period of time ranging from minutes to days. RAPID introduces a flexible time dimension in the form of pulse or pulse-chase experiments for studying genome-wide occupancy of a protein of interest by next-gen sequencing. It can also be coupled to other readouts such as mass spectrometry or microscopy. RAPID is uniquely suited for studying cell cycle-linked processes, by defining when and where stable ‘marks’ are set in chromatin. I will employ mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) as a model system for pluripotency and lineage specification. RAPID will define fundamental rules for inheritance of histone and other chromatin-associated proteins and how they are modulated by the fast cell cycle of pluripotent cells. Using RAPID in combination with other state-of-the art genetics and epigenomics, I will collect multi-dimensional descriptions of the dynamic evolution and propagation of functionally relevant chromatin states, such as interstitial heterochromatin and developmentally regulated Polycomb domains.

1262	Caroline Ospelt	University of Zurich	Klinik für Rheumatologie Universitätsspital Zürich	2017-12-01	2021-11-30	Unravelling the impact of genetic risk loci in rheumatoid arthritis	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a symmetric inflammatory and destructive autoimmune arthritis, which mainly involves the small joints of the hands and feet. 0.5-1% of the world population is affected by RA and suffers from progressive disability and increased mortality. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 100 genetic susceptibility loci for RA, the majority mapping to the noncoding genome. The relevant cell types and the function of these risk variants is, however, largely unknown. Synovial fibroblasts (SF), resident cells of the synovium, play a central role in joint inflammation and destruction in RA. Our latest research shows that SF from different joints are distinct cell types, with joint specific transcriptomes, epigenomes and functions, creating a unique environment in each joint. We propose that these differences predispose certain synovial joints towards the development of RA and underlie the pathognomic patterns of joint involvement seen in various types of chronic arthritis. Specifically, we hypothesise that genetic risk loci exhibit joint-specific effects and thereby promote RA development in specific joints only. In the current proposal, we aim to 1) identify causal RA risk variants that are effective in SF and map them to specific joint regions, and 2) explore the functional impact of identified joint specific risk variants on SF biology. To this end, we will combine genetic data that we will obtain in collaboration with the Center of Genetics and Genomics at the University of Manchester with our extensive genome-wide epigenetic data sets of SF from hand, shoulder and knee joints. For functional analysis, we will employ CRISPRCas9 gene editing technology alongside standard in vitro gain and loss of function approaches in cultured SF. Furthermore, cultured SF will be selected based on their genotype and functionally analysed. We will also compare the composition of fresh synovial tissues from different joints on single cell level, obtained from patients homozygous for the risk and non-risk alleles, obtaining the valuable information of the in vivo and in situ effects of the candidate RA risk SNPs.With this project, we will unravel the role of genetic RA risk loci in synovial biology and link the genetic RA risk with specific anatomic susceptibility of joints to develop RA. Our data will significantly increase the knowledge of the impact of genetic risk variants in RA and will have broad implications for the comprehension of RA disease biology. With the anatomic dimension of cellular diversity, we are introducing a novel concept to human genetics of a location-specific action of disease-risk loci. Ultimately, this project will generate a comprehensive catalogue of reference epigenomes for human synovial fibroblasts in health and arthritis tailored to scientific community to catalyse future genetic studies in RA and other types of arthritis.

Apomixis is a clonal mode of seed formation occurring naturally in many plant species but not in major crop plants. Revolutionizing agriculture practices via engineered apomixis bear great promises yet requires a deep understanding of its mechanisms. One goal, notably, is to elucidate the processes leading to ectopic germ cell fate in the ovule of so-called aposporous plant species. Despite considerable progress in deciphering genetic and epigenetic contributions we are critically lacking a developmental, morphogenetic level. Yet, recent observations from the partners’ groups indeed suggest a link between tissue patterning events in the early ovule and ectopic germ cells. By exploiting the advent of high-resolution 3D imaging, image processing, and tissue growth modeling approaches, together with functional genetics, IMAGO proposes to elucidate patterning rules governing ovule growth, and their contribution to female germ cell fate acquisition. Ultimately, IMAGO provides novel tools and knowledge contributing innovation towards engineering apomixis.Objectives. IMAGO combines high-resolution static and real-time 3D imaging, quantitative image processing, cell-based growth models and functional approaches to (1) define cellular growth patterns in the ovule primordium using quantitative imaging (2) test patterning rules in silico by cell-based growth models (3) validate patterning rules in vivo using genetic and pharmacological perturbations; and analyzing sexual and apomictic grasses (Maize and Paspalum).Partners and Synergy. IMAGO is an interdisciplinary project that requires the synergistic contributions of Partner 1: Daphné Autran (French coordinator), Daniel Grimanelli (participating scientist), Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD Montpellier, France); Partner 2: Célia Baroux (Swiss coordinator), Department of Plant and Microbial Biology (University of Zürich, Switzerland); Partner 3: Christophe Godin, INRIA, France; Partner 4 (external advisors): Olivier Hamant and Arezki Boudaoud (ENS Lyon, France). Partner 1 and 2 are developmental biologists sharing expertise in genetic, molecular and cytological approaches to analyze plant reproduction. Specific and complementary expertise are brought by Partner 1 on maize and apomictic reproduction, by Partner 2 on high-resolution imaging and quantitative image processing, by Partner 3 on 4D image processing and 3D topological modeling, and by Partners 4 on 2D modeling of plant growth patterns. Impact. (i) high-training benefits for the recruited scientists: interdisciplinary research combining cell biology, high-resolution imaging and mathematical modeling in top-excellence institutes, (ii) novel tools and methodologies to study ovule development through imaging and modeling at the cellular and tissue level, in 4D, (iii) a novel conceptual framework integrating growth dynamics and germ cell fate acquisition in the ovule, linking therein two traditionally disconnected research fields, (iv) novel insights on the developmental plasticity of plant ovule contributing the long-term goal of engineering apomixis in crop plants, (v) dissemination: IMAGO ambitions several peer-reviewed scientific articles and produce attractive image material suitable for public outreach. In addition, dedicated efforts to disseminate the knowledge developed by IMAGO to the European plant breeding community, in both academy and industry will be undertaken, to raise their awareness on progress toward the development of apomictic crops.

Memory T cells provide a cellular basis for this key feature of adaptive immunity, yet the molecular mechanisms governing the cellular memory response remain only partially understood.Memory CD8+ T cells can acquire effector function within hours of an antigenic challenge ('innate-like' response). Recently, we found that activation of human memory CD8+ T cells rapidly triggers enhanced glycolytic flux ('immediate-early glycolytic switch'), which is required for the 'innate-like' kinetics of IFN-gamma production. Additionally, we identified the serine-threonine kinase Akt to play a central role in mediating this metabolic switch.We now propose to further define how immediate-early metabolic reprogramming is controlled in CD8+ T cells, and how metabolic changes are linked to the rapid CD8+ T cell recall response. Specifically, we propose to (i) determine the molecular mechanisms triggering, supporting and regulating immediate-early glycolytic switch, (ii) assess the functionality and role of mitochondria during the early-phase of the recall response, and (iii) broadly define the impact of glucose metabolism on genetic and epigenetic regulation of 'innate-like' CD8+ T cell reactivity. We then aim to translate insight gained from basic experiments to elucidate and differentiate the metabolic signature of immunosenescent (i.e. functionally impaired) CD8+ T cells.

1265	Dr Juan Vaquerizas	MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences	None	2019-10-01	2017-09-30	Developmental and Regulatory Genomics	The three-dimensional organisation of chromatin in the nucleus plays a fundamental role in providing cells with correct gene expression control throughout development and normal physiology. Recent advances in our ability to quantitatively measure chromatin conformation, such as Hi-C, have provided invaluable insight into how a multi-layered structure of compartments, globular domains and loops neatly arranges interphase chromatin according to its function. The three-dimensional organisation of the genome is intimately intertwined with additional molecular mechanisms that control gene expression, such as DNA methylation and chromatin modifications, among others. Highlighting the importance of this organisation for healthy genome function, mutations in elements that determine chromatin conformation result in severe developmental disorders and cancer. Since chromatin organisation lies at the most basic layer of genome regulation, it is paramount to understand the molecular mechanisms that drive this organisation. We employ genomic techniques that examine changes in all these different epigenetic features (e.g., chromatin organisation, DNA methylation, chromatin modifications) during early embryonic development in a range of model organisms. Gametogenesis and early embryonic development are key stages in the life of an organism, since the epigenetic programmes of the fully differentiated gametes need to be reverted back to a totipotent stage, in order to give rise to a new individual. By examining changes in chromatin conformation at these key developmental points genome-wide, we can identify the molecular mechanisms that drive these changes, and as a result, decipher how these are affected in disease. We pay particular emphasis to repetitive elements, since these display a strong association with molecular features characteristic of early embryonic developmental processes. Specifically, families of murine-specific retrotransposons, such as MERVL, seem to play a key role during zygotic genome activation, i.e., the key stage when the zygotic genome takes over developmental control from the maternal contributed products present in the oocyte. Through careful computational analysis of these elements, we aim to understand how these retroviral-derived repetitive elements have evolved to acquire their own bona-fide regulatory activities in the genome. Overall, our research aims to discover key molecular mechanisms that determine the correct establishment of gene developmental programmes in the early embryo and to characterise how these are affected in human disease.

Glial cells such as astrocytes induce regenerative processes in acute inflammation, but fail to inhibit tissue destruction for yet unknown reasons in chronic disease. In preliminary studies, we identified heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) in astrocytes as novel tissue protective factor. Indeed, knock-down of HB-EGF in astrocytes led to exacerbated disease and failure to recover in an animal model of MS. Promoter studies revealed induction of HB-EGF by the ligand-induced transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) in acute inflammation. However, astrocytic HB-EGF decreased in chronic stages concomitantly with progressive disease worsening. Analyses of AHR binding sites in the HB-EGF promoter revealed epigenetic modifications mediated by DNA-Methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in chronic inflammation, which inhibited promoter activation by AHR. Knocking down DNMT1 prevented epigenetic changes and increased HB-EGF production in chronic stages. Thus, we have discovered astrocytic HB-EGF as a novel regenerative factor and its regulation by AHR and DNMT1, which could be targeted therapeutically to enhance tissue regeneration in chronic stages. In this project, we will define the role of HB-EGF in acute and chronic autoimmune CNS inflammation (Aim 1), its regulation by AHR and DNMT1 (Aim 2), and the therapeutic value of nasal HB-EGF application or DNMT1 blockade (Aim 3). In a translational approach, we will validate AHR ligands, HB-EGF and HB-EGF promoter methylation status in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients as novel biomarkers for MS (Aim 4). These high risk/high gain studies explore novel concepts for monitoring and therapy of yet untreatable stages of MS and other degenerative diseases of the CNS.

1267	Prof. Doron MERKLER	UNIVERSITE DE GENEVE	None	2020-05-01	2025-04-30	Molecular pathology of anti-viral T cell responses in the central nervous system	Immune responses against viruses in the central nervous system (CNS) can result in devastating outcomes. Even non-cytolytic CD8+ T cell interactions, which purge viruses from neurons without triggering cell death, can induce permanent damage. Yet, how this immune response irreversibly disrupts neuronal homeostasis remains unclear. Here, we will elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underlie non-cytolytic CD8+ T cell engagement with infected neurons and their consequences on neuron function in vivo. We hypothesize that inflammatory signalling in neurons, induced by non-cytolytic CD8+ T cell interactions, triggers metabolic and epigenetic changes that underpin permanent neuronal dysfunction. "PATHOCODE" will test this hypothesis by harnessing a unique animal model of T cell-driven virus encephalitis in the following objectives: 1. Discern neuronal subset-specific vulnerabilities and antigen-dependent versus bystander effects in the inflamed CNS. We will perform single nucleus RNA sequencing to examine whether T cell engagement (a) differentially affects molecularly distinct neurons, and (b) affects non-targeted, uninfected neurons. 2. Uncover the consequences of non-cytolytic T cell engagement on neuronal metabolism. We will use cell-specific mitochondrial reporter mice to investigate immune-driven metabolic adaptation of neurons in vivo. 3. Determine how non-cytolytic T cell engagement affects the neuronal epigenome. We will employ cell-specific nucleus/ribosome reporter mice to elucidate how T cell engagement affects the translatome and epigenome of infected cells. 4. Rescue T cell-mediated neuronal dysfunction by restoring metabolic pathways. We will exploit recent CRISPR/Cas9 technological advances to restore neuronal gene expression and uncover the relevance of immune-driven metabolic and epigenomic changes to disease. Our study will thus provide novel molecular concepts about immune-driven neuronal alterations in CNS inflammatory diseases.	European Research Council	Consolidator Grant	1999954.0	EUR

Rather it is folded into an elaborate and coherent pattern that permits interactions between genomic elements separated by large genomic distances. The precise folding is still currently debated and different models have been developed over the years. The immunoglobulin heavy chain locus has been extensively studied with regard to the folding of the chromatin fiber in 3D-space. Briefly, the data showed that during the early B cell development stage (pro-B cell stage), the entire Vh region repertoire (2.5 Mbp) is organized as one domain and juxtaposed to the Dh elements. This topology permits the entire Vh region family to encounter DhJh elements with relatively high and similar frequencies. These data were the first to describe the 3D structure of a genetic locus and revealed a critical mechanism that underpins the generation of a diverse antibody repertoire. During the past two years, I have extended these studies and demonstrated a critical role for chromatin remodelers in chromatin topology. Specifically, I have demonstrated a critical role for the chromatin remodeler, Brg1, in Igh locus contraction. Here I propose to continue these studies both with respect to the structure of the Igh locus and the folding of the entire genome in pro-B cells. I would examine how Brg1 modulates Igh locus topology. Using high-resolution microscopy, I would investigate the role of Brg1 in chromatin territories. Using formaldehyde cross-linking approach conjugated with next-generation sequencing, I would determine the function of Brg1 in long-range interactions in pro-B cells.AIMThe goal of my research is to determine the role played by chromatin remodelers in long-range chromatin interactions and chromatin topology. SPECIFIC AIMSAIM 1. TO DETERMINE THE ROLE OF BRG1 IN ANTIGEN RECEPTOR TOPOLOGY.To determine how Brg1 affects the Igh locus topology, high precision spatial distance measurements and computational geometry would be performed. The analysis would be done using control and Brg1 depleted pro-B cells. These data would reveal how Brg1 affects the ensemble of Igh locus trajectories in pro-B lineage cells. Previous data from the Murre laboratory indicated that the Igh locus in B cells is organized into chromatin territories. Igh locus compartments would be visualized using structured illumination microscopy and the role of Brg1 in compartmentalization of the Igh locus would be determined by comparing control and Brg1 depleted pro-B cells.AIM 2. TO DETERMINE THE ROLE OF BRG1 IN MODULATING THE 3D-TOPOLOGY OF THE PRO-B CELL GENOME.I have shown that Brg1 modulates Igh locus contraction. To determine how Brg1 modulates chromatin topology, a genome-wide occupancy study of Brg1 in pro-B cells would be performed. Cis-regulatory codes and epigenetic modifications associated with Brg1 occupancy would be determined. In addition, since non-coding transcription on the Igh locus is dependent on Brg1, the impact of deletion of Brg1 on the pro-B transcriptome (coding and non-coding) would be examined using strand-specific RNA-Seq. Finally, Brg1 would be depleted in pro-B cells and a formaldehyde cross-linking approach conjugated with next-generation sequencing (Hi-C method) would be used to determine how Brg1 modulates the folding of the pro-B cell genome. 3D-FISH would be used to verify genome-wide interactions that are affected by ablation of Brg1. These studies would shed light on the role of chromatin remodeling in the higher order structure of the pro-B cell genome.

BackgroundDrug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a potentially fatal adverse event with significant medical and economic impact. Steatosis is one of the phenotypic manifestations of DILI and is largely due to off-target effects which cause mitochondrial damage, e.g. by inhibition of fatty acid beta-oxidation. Ligands of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) are being developed as therapeutic agents for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), but it is unknown whether these agents also have preventive or therapeutic value in the context of drug-induced steatosis. Because the expression of the hepatocellular OATPs (organic anion transporting polypeptides) is decreased in steatosis, novel therapeutic agents should not decrease expression further and thereby negatively affect hepatic drug clearance by OATPs. In the kidney, nephrotoxic drugs have been identified as substrates of the organic cation and carnitine transporters (OCTs and OCTNs). However, the potential of drug transporters in the prevention of drug nephrotoxicity has not been investigated. 1.2. Working Hypotheses•drug-induced steatosis (DIS) in mice is attenuated by treatment with the FXR agonist obeticholic acid (OCA)•the effect of FXR ligands on drug-induced steatosis can be assessed in hepatocyte cell systems in vitro•ligands of the nuclear receptor PPARa, which are being evaluated for the treatment of steatosis, decrease the expression of hepatocellular OATPs by transcriptional suppression of promoter activity and by epigenetic mechanisms involving induction of specific microRNAs•sphingolipids are potential biomarkers of drug-induced steatosis / liver injury both in vivo in mice and in vitro in hepatocytes and can serve as treatment endpoints for the assessment of the protective effect of FXR activation on drug-induced liver damage•drugs that are toxic to the kidney are substrates of drug transporters expressed in renal tubular cells and inhibition of these transporters could be a protective strategy against drug-induced kidney injury 1.3. Specific Aims•To study the effect of the FXR ligand OCA on mechanisms of hepatotoxicity induced by amiodarone, valproic acid, tetracycline and the herbal triptolide•To study the effect of FXR ligands on various endpoints of drug-induced toxicity in hepatocytes in vitro•To evaluate sphingolipids as potential biomarkers of DILI in mouse and cell-based models of drug-induced liver injury/steatosis, as well as in human samples from patients with acute DILI•To assess the effect of PPARa ligands - a potential therapeutic strategy in steatosis - on the expression of human hepatocellular OATPs, notably on transcriptional and epigenetic regulation•To characterize the regulation of the human hepatocellular OATPs by microRNA-126, shown to decrease OATP expression and function in hepatocytes in vitro•To study the role of organic cation and carnitine transporters in drug-induced kidney injury and evaluate inhibition of these transporters as a protective strategy 1.4. Methods•C57/BJ mice are randomized into an OCA pretreatment group and a control group and are subsequently administered a steatosis-causing drug (tetracycline, valproic acid or amiodarone) or the herbal triptolide•Endpoints include histological analysis of lipid staining, apoptosis, markers of ER stress, lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial toxicity, expression of drug and bile acid transporters at the mRNA and protein levels, as well as hepatic and plasma levels of sphingolipids as biomarkers of DILI•In vitro cell culture including primary human hepatocytes, HepaRG cells and 3D organoids•Transcriptional regulation of OATP transporter genes by PPARa ligands: promoter analysis, deletional constructs, reporter gene assays in transfected cells, specific gene knockdowns using siRNA technology, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and site-directed mutagenesis•Analysis of miR-126 interaction with target genes•Transport assays in stably transfected HEK-293 cells•Assessment of drug-induced toxicity in primary isolated proximal renal tubular cells (PRTCs)1.5. Expected Value of the Proposed ProjectThis project aims to characterize novel protective strategies against drug-induced liver and kidney injury in appropriate model systems. By measuring markers of ER stress, mitochondrial respiration and oxidative stress, as well as hepatic and plasma levels of sphingolipids as potential biomarkers of drug-induced steatosis / liver injury, we will identify the potential benefit of FXR activation on ameliorating the mechanisms that lead to drug-induced steatosis. The role of drug transporters will be assessed by (i) studying the effect of therapeutic nuclear receptor ligands on the expression of drug transporters in hepatocytes, and (ii) evaluating inhibitors of drug transport in renal tubular cells as protective agents against uptake of drugs that cause kidney injury.

The laboratory of Li-Huei Tsai has generated a genetically manipulated mouse model (CK-p25 mouse) that displays key pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease, including neuronal loss in the forebrain, increased ß-amyloid peptide production, tau pathology, and severe cognitive impairment (Cruz et al., 2003; Fischer et al., 2005). Strikingly, the Tsai laboratory showed that the severe cognitive impairment of these mice can be rescued by either exposing the animals to an enriched environment (EE) or by the administration of a histone deacetylase inhibitor (Fischer et al., 2007). More recent data from the Tsai laboratory indicate that an increased expression level of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) in the hippocampus of CK-p25 mice causes an epigenetic blockade of gene expression which results in Alzheimer’s disease-related memory decline (Graff et al., 2012; Guan et al., 2009).The proposed project aims towards understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the HDAC2-mediated cognitive decline in the Alzheimer’s disease mouse model. More specifically, one of the objectives of the proposed project is to identify the genes regulated by HDAC2 as well as the factors directing HDAC2 to these genes in the hippocampus of CK-p25 mice.Furthermore, the proposed project aims towards understanding how environmental enrichment (EE) leads to recovery of impaired learning and memory in the Alzheimer’s disease mouse model. More specifically, this objective includes (1) testing the hypothesis that exposure to an enriched environment reverses the HDAC2-mediated epigenetic blockade of cognitive functions in the neurodegenerating brain and (2) investigating how HDAC2 is regulated during this process.The questions and hypotheses will be addressed using state of the art methods in molecular and cellular neuroscience as well as genomics approaches.ReferencesCruz, J.C., Tseng, H.C., Goldman, J.A., Shih, H., and Tsai, L.H.

Our group has shown that CDX2 protein is absent or markedly reduced in up to 20% of colorectal cancers, which correlates with de-differentiation, metastatic spread and unfavorable patient outcome. Our preliminary data using a panel of colorectal cancer cell lines confirms that promoter hypermethylation is a likely cause of CDX2 expression loss, since CDX2 expression can be recovered upon treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi). Here, we aim to show that epigenetic modifications leading to CDX2 loss are clinically and functionally relevant and that these effects can be reversed by epigenetic therapies. Since these therapies have ‘global’ effects on demethylation, we aim to overcome the methylation blockade of CDX2, by establishing a state-of the-art method for specific targeting of the CDX2 promoter for re-activation. To achieve these aims, we will first determine whether CDX2 promoter hypermethylation causes CDX2 protein loss in human colorectal cancers and we will assess the relationship of CDX2 with the general methylator phenotype. Second, we take advantage of a fully-characterized cohort of colorectal cancer patients (n=750) to determine the potential prognostic and predictive relevance of CDX2 hypermethylation and protein loss. Third, we will identify novel transcriptional regulators of CDX2 based on transcription binding site prediction (e.g. GATA family members and p300) by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and validate results using other promoter assays. The function of these transcription factors in colorectal cancer cell lines after knock-down will be assessed. Our findings will be validated using fresh frozen material from our high-quality biobank. Fourth, we will determine the effects of DNMTis and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) on methylated and unmethylated cell lines in vitro and CDX2 expression. Chromatin structure will be investigated by analysing open and repressed histone marks and their effect on CDX2 restoration. To re-activate silenced CDX2 promoters we propose to use CRISPR technology to target either a transcriptional activation domain or the catalytic domain of the demethylating TET2 protein to the human CDX2 promoter. Small guide (sg) RNAs will be designed and tested to target nuclease inactive Cas9 fused to either VPS64, a transcriptional activator, or to the catalytic domain of TET2, a demethylating enzyme to the CDX2 promoter region. To further increase the chance of successful re-activation of the CDX2 promoter, we take advantage of an amplifier system based on a polypeptide scaffold (Sun Tag) fused to the inactive Cas9 protein. The Sun Tag will be able to recruit multiple VPS64 or TET2 proteins, fused to single chain variable fragment specific for the Sun polypeptide, to the CDX2 promoter region. We will establish CDX2 knockdown colon cancer cell lines and compare expression of CDX2 in methylated, unmethylated and genomically modified cell lines, then perform functional assays to determine effects on proliferation, migration and invasion. This will allow us to determine whether CDX2 expression and its function can be reversed upon modification. This proposal uses the latest genome editing technologies to uncover new aspects of CDX2 in colorectal cancers. Not only will the clinical and biological relevance of this gene be detailed, but new regulatory aspects of CDX2 will be highlighted. Additionally, successful targeted re-activation of an already-methylated promoter, as we are proposing to do in the project, may be further generalized to other important tumor suppressor genes and could have significant therapeutic potential.

Many of the cancer cell properties that have been identified or proposed decades ago, including their heterogeneity despite clonal origin and their capacity to subvert the host tissue stroma, have yet to be exploited from a therapeutic standpoint. Metastasis, the primary cause of cancer-related death, remains virtually unscathed by the current therapeutic arsenal. To complicate issues further, it is becoming increasingly clear that epigenetic changes may play a key role in tumor progression and resistance to therapy and even override the influence of genetic mutations themselves. The long term goal of this project is to acquire a better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie cancer initiation, development and heterogeneity with the hope that such understanding will help identify new therapeutic targets and lead to rationally designed, effective therapeutic strategies. We have chosen to focus on sarcomas, which include some of the most aggressive tumors, often arising in children and young adults, associated with a somber prognosis despite aggressive multimodal therapy. Because these malignancies have not been investigated as intensely as the more common carcinomas, they are still poorly understood from a biological standpoint. The short term goal is to determine the nature of tumor cell hierarchies in sarcomas, the properties that distinguish sarcoma stem/initiator cells (CSC/CIC) from the bulk of tumor cells, including their chromatin modifications and bioenergetics, and the mechanisms that render mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSC/MPC) permissive for specific oncogene expression and action and thereby elucidate how sarcomas are generated. These issues will be addressed in Ewing sarcoma family tumors (ESFT), where we have made several novel observations in the past decade that have led to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of these tumors. We will also dedicate one specific aim to the characterization of the epigenetic features, primarily chromatin modifications, of synovial sarcoma based on preliminary data, which suggest a hitherto unrecognized mechanism of action of the synovial-sarcoma-specific fusion protein SS18-SSX. The specific aims are as follows:Specific Aim 1: Assessment of the effect LIN28B and IGF2BPs (IMPs) on Ewing sarcoma cancer stem cell emergence and maintenance. This section will include:1.1Analysis of the effect LIN28B depletion on primary ESFT growth in vivo ; 1.2Analysis of the effect of LIN28B expression in MSC with and without EWS-FLI-1;1.3Comparison of the effect of LIN28 and IMP family members on ESFT cancer stem cell maintenance;1.4Assessment of the role of NF-kB in ESFT CSC maintenance and function.Specific Aim 2: Determination of the genome-wide RNA binding repertoire of LIN28. This section will include:2.1. Determination of the mRNA binding repertoire of LIN28B in spherogenic versus adherent ESFT cells by PAR-CLIP;Specific Aim 3: Assessment of the role of FLI-1 in Ewing sarcoma development. This section will include:3.1 Assessment of the effect of FLI-1 depletion and overexpression on ESFT CSCs;3.2 Assessment of the effect of FLI-1 depletion on MSC transformation by EWS-FLI-1; Specific Aim 4: Assessment of chromatin modifications in primary synovial sarcoma (SS) and assessment of the functional relationship between SS18-SSX and the Wnt pathway. This section will include:4.1 Generation of primary SS cells ans SS cell lines expressing tagged SS18-SSX;4.2. Assessment of the epigenetic profile of primary SS cells and SS cell lines by ChIP-seq.

SUMMARY OF THE RESEARCH PLAN Mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion genes are a molecular hallmark of pediatric and adult acute leukemia with poor prognosis. In order to identify novel principles for molecularly tailored therapy we have generated conditional transgenic mice for the most prevalent MLL fusions closely phenocopying the disease. We found that activation of the MLL-AF9 fusion in hematopoietic stem cells results in a more aggressive disease than in progenitor cells. Expression profiling and functional validation experiments suggest the attractive possibility for origin-related therapeutic targets. Importantly, many of the murine targets were significantly associated with poor prognosis in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In parallel, we have provided proof of principle for potent anti-leukemic activity of novel small molecule bromodomain inhibitors, and identified several protein kinases that are essential for the transformed state mediated by the MLL-AF9 fusion. To continue our work we propose 3 major experimental aims: AIM 1: MODELING MLL ACUTE LEUKEMIAA. We will functionally explore the role of selected origin-dependent MLL-fusion targets for their role for induction and maintenance of the disease in murine and human pre-clinical models of AML. B. We aim to establish a mouse model for MLL-fusion induced infant acute leukemia. AIM 2: THERAPEUTIC TARGETING OF MLL ACUTE LEUKEMIA A. We will functionally validate a novel small molecule bromodomain inhibitor targeting the epigenetic co-regulators CBP and EP300 for its anti-leukemic potential in vitro and in vivo. B. We will validate protein kinases that emerged from our shRNA knockdown screen for their role for disease maintenance and potential therapeutic target in AML. AIM 3: THE ROLE OF THE MICROENVIRONMENT IN MLL ACUTE LEUKEMIAA. We will analyze changes of the bone marrow microenvironment during early and late phase of expansion of MLL-fusion driven acute leukemia. B. We will address the molecular crosstalk between mesenchymal stroma cells (MSCs) and leukemic blasts; and we will use a genetic approach to study the role of MSCs for maintenance and relapse of MLL acute leukemia. Acute leukemia harboring MLL fusion genes are often characterized by early relapse and poor prognosis. We found that the cellular origin determinates the aggressiveness of the disease reflected by poor outcome and is associated with a particular genetic signature. We aim to take a step forward into the direction of personalized medicine by exploring the attractive possibility of origin-dependent therapeutic targeting. Characterization of epigenetic mechanisms in acute leukemia also offers completely novel and promising therapeutic strategies: here we will demonstrate the potent anti-leukemic activity a novel small molecule that selectively blocks the CBP/EP300 transcriptional co-regulators. In parallel, we will validate potentially drugable protein kinases for the maintenance of MLL acute leukemia. Our mouse models also offer the opportunity to study crosstalk between leukemic cells and the bone marrow microenvironment with the idea to identify novel therapeutic opportunities targeting the stroma. The results so far suggest that this work will provide important insights into the biology and therapeutic targeting of AML or other cancers beyond the MLL fusions. The complementary approach of identification and functional validation of therapeutic strategies in murine and human pre-clinical leukemia models will increase the chance that some of these findings will be translated into clinical trials and ultimately patient care to improve the outcome of these rare but mostly fatal diseases.

SUMMARY Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the product of a limited number of cooperating mutations such as fusions involving the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene. We recently demonstrated that the cell-of-origin is a critical nominator for the biology and the clinical outcome of the disease. Expression of the MLL-AF9 fusion in long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSC) resulted in an unusually invasive AML associated with an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like gene signature linked to poor outcome of AML patients. We also obtained proof of concept that the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment supports MLL-AF9-driven AML by regulating oxidative stress. To further characterize the role of the cellular origin and the microenvironment in AML we aim to: 1) Explore the origin-related epigenetic dynamics in AML: Increasing evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms might drive AML progression. To dissect cooperating epigenetic mechanisms during disease progression we will establish a novel transgenic mouse model that allows tracking and enrichment of cells expressing the driving MLL-AF9 fusion to compare origin-related dynamic changes of chromatin conformation, gene expression and DNA methylation at different stages of the disease. 2) Characterize the cellular origin of LT-HSC-derived AML: Aggressive LT-HSC-derived MLL-AF9 driven AML is associated with high expression levels of the transcription factors Evi1 and Erg. Likewise, EVI1 and ERG expression characterized AML patients with poor outcome. To better understand the cellular origin of this particularly invasive AML, we aim to explore whether expression of EVI1/ERG or a dynamic cellular identity determines the susceptibility of LT-HSC for transformation by a leukemogenic fusion gene.3) Characterize the putative drivers of invasive LT-HSC-derived AML: Aggressive LT-HSC-derived MLL-AF9 AML is characterized by expression of genes related to invasion and/or EMT. Several genes of this signature characterized the outcome of AML patients not limited to MLL rearrangements. Therefore systematic characterization of their role for development and maintenance of AML may reveal novel drivers and future therapeutic targets.4) Dissect the critical crosstalk between AML and the BM microenvironment: The BM microenvironments of AML patients or diseased iMLL-AF9 transgenic mice contain an increased number of nestin-expressing mesenchymal stroma cells (Nes+BM-MSC). Preliminary observations suggest that Nes+BM-MSC protect AML blasts from oxidative stress. We will use the iMLL-AF9 mouse model to identify regulators of oxidative stress critical for AML induction and maintenance. Significance: Despite treatment with chemotherapy and stem cell transplants most AML patients relapse and die from their disease urging the need for novel therapeutic strategies. We have previously provided evidence that the cellular origin is a major indicator for disease outcome. The proposed research will identify and validate origin-related targets and dissect cooperating epigenetic mechanisms to open the avenue for therapeutic interference of disease progression or chemoprevention. Furthermore, dissection of the crosstalk between the leukemic blasts and the protecting BM niche will provide proof of concept for combined therapeutic targeting of tumor cells and the microenvironment.

They are responsible for the huge variation of genome size in the flowering plants, particularly in the monocotyledons. In the Triticeae (wheat, barley, etc.) family, they can constitute up to 80% of the whole genome sequence. Their activity can influence the transcription of genes by a variety of ways, including insertional disruption of genes and epigenetic mechanisms. It has been shown that LTR retrotransposons get activated upon inducing stress conditions like drought or UV. They move by a copy and paste mechanism, leading to an additional copy after every transposition. LTR retrotransposons encode only their own set of proteins needed for transposition but are rely on the transcription machinery from their host genome. Moreover, the retrotransposons themselves interact: they are present as two groups, the autonomous and non-autonomous elements. Autonomous elements can transpose on their own, while the non-autonomous can only do so if they contain motifs to allow recognition by the machinery encoded by an autonomous element. This complementation allows the non-autonomous element to proliferate, despitetheir lack of coding capacity. This two-fold dynamic between the cell, autonomous elements, and non autonomous elements has far-reaching consequences for genome structure and evolution.AimWe plan to analyze relationship between autonomous and non-autonomousretrotransposons by addressing several open questions. First, are thenon-autonomous elements specialized to a 'host' LTR retrotransposon or have they developed the ability to parasite a wide range of host elements? Second, do the two groups compete for the available 'genome space' and proteins needed for transposition, i.e., do non-autonomous elements affect the transposition of autonomous elements as parasites? Third, is there an evolutionary selection for a certain mode of complementation? For this, we want to analyze if the interactionbetween autonomous and non-autonomous elements influenced the pattern of genome evolution. Experimental designIntensive generation of various types of sequence data for barley (Hordeum vulgare) is currently underway and provides an ideal resource for this project. For comparative analysis, data from wild barley (H. spontaneum) and sequences from the closely related bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) will be used. The huge amount of data needs bioinformatics approaches for screening and mining. We will focus on LTR retrotransposons of the Copia and Gypsy superfamilies. The BARE1, Bagy1, and Bagy2 families represent the main autonomous elements, and BARE2, Cassandra, and LARD will serve as non-autonomous examples. In a first approach, the host retrotransposons and the corresponding non-autonomous elements will be identified. Non-autonomous elements will be harvested by screening for the recognition signals like PBS and Psi. Comparison to autonomous elements will identify the host LTR retrotransposon. In a second approach, segments which were identified to belong to LTR retrotransposons will be clustered, aligned and categorized. The population structure and conserved features of non-autonomous elements will be analyzed. ImportanceThis work will identify new mechanism of parasitism and replication as well as influences of retrotransposons on each other and on the host genome. The effect on the host genome, which includes the movement of cellular genes linked to Cassandra and LARDs, will add information to other mechanisms as post-transcriptional gene silencing, virus resistance and genome evolution. The information gained from this project on virus-like particle (VLP) formation and subsequent nuclear targeting for DNA insertion can be used to develop retrotransposon vectors to integrate exogenous proteins into host genomes.

This is complicated by the observation that manyvirologically-confirmed cases in children are asymptomatic. Undocumented, and likely infectious, cases couldresult in exposure to a far greater proportion of the community than would otherwise occur. Indeed, it has beenproposed that undocumented (or silent) infections are the source for almost 80% of documented infections (Liet al, Science); thus, it is critical to determine the silent and symptomatic infection rate in children.To overcome challenges for clinical study implementation imposed by current healthcare access restrictions,we propose a surveillance study to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (detection of virus innasal secretions) over time in children and their household contacts (caregivers and siblings). In addition to theneed for surveying children for asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, this study will allow a comparisonbetween children with asthma and other atopic conditions and children without those conditions.Figure 3.1 Study OverviewStudy designWe propose to conduct a prospective surveillance study in which children (index child) and their householdcontacts, including caregiver(s) and siblings, will be enrolled at study sites with NIH-funded studies. Potentialparticipants are those enrolled in existing NIH-funded studies (including the Wisconsin Infant Cohort Study, theChildhood Origins of Asthma [COAST] study, the MUPPITS-2 study, the RACR study and the UrbanEnvironment and Childhood Asthma[URECA] study). The intent is to recruit children who have asthma and/or other atopic conditions, as well ashealthy children, with extensive medical information and information on atopic status available as part of theirparticipation in cohort studies. The enrollment goal is approximately 2000 families to be enrolled overapproximately 2 weeks, and each participant will be observed for 6 months. During the study, biologicalsamples will be collected by the family at pre-determined intervals and symptom and exposure surveys will becompleted on-line at the time the biological samples are collected (Figure 1 Study Overview). Some biologicalsamples (nasal swabs and stool) will be collected by the caregiver at home. Blood samples will be collected ata home study visit or at an independent clinical laboratory, depending on feasibility. Samples will be processedin central laboratories, and Rho Inc. will serve as the coordinating center for the study.The primary outcome of the study will be the percent of index children and their household contacts withdetectable SARS-CoV-2 in nasal secretions.

Supp NOT AI-20-031, PA-18-591Supplement on Grant Number: 5UM1AI114271-06Project Summary (Primary award-ICAC)The overall goals of our proposal are designed to address current high priority unmetneeds in asthma that exist in inner cities, as well as elsewhere, including efforts to applyimmune-based strategies to reduce severity, diminish progression of disease, and teststrategies to prevent asthma. In that context, we hypothesize that environmental exposure toallergens, particularly cockroach, is a major risk factor for allergic sensitization and thedevelopment of asthma, and an important determinant of disease progression plus a target forimmunotherapy, severity and responsiveness to treatment. Moreover, we hypothesize thatIgE-sensitization, IgE-mediated processes, and wheezing with respiratory infections areimportant and linked risk factors in the development of asthma, and by targeting treatment toregulate IgE early in life it may be possible to prevent the progression from recurrent wheezingto asthma. Furthermore, asthma in inner-city children is represented by multiple phenotypes,some of which have uncontrolled disease which will benefit by treatment directed towardsphenotypic characteristics of their disease, e.g. exacerbation prone and obesity. Listed beloware our proposals to reach our goals and reduce unmet needs of asthma in the inner city.1. Aim 1. URECA, Urban Environment and Childhood Asthma is our inner-city birth cohort thatwas designed to establish the role and contribution of environmental risk factors on immunedevelopment and function that lead to asthma which will be further accomplished by studyingthe children until they are 14 to 16 years of age, and by this approach determine asthmaphenotypes and progression of disease.2. Aim 2. The Influence of the Inner City House Dust Microbiome and Respiratory andGastrointestinal Microbiome Composition Function and their Relationships to AllergicOutcomes. The overall aim of this mechanistic study is to determine whether the householdenvironment represents a significant source of bacteria that (1) populates respiratory and/orgastrointestinal microbiomes in early infancy; (2) to identify the key microbial species andfunction in both of these host niches that are associated with protection from asthma; (3) toidentify the microbial metabolic products and their function to shape immune responses; and (4)to pursue the development of protectivemicrobes as a treatment intervention to prevent asthma.3. Aim 3. Systems Biology Analysis in URECA. The overall aim of this mechanistic study is toextend the current ICAC2 epigenetic study to the application of a systems biology analysis tomore fully establish the complex integration of in utero and post-natal environmental stimuli,inherited factors, and dynamic biological responses in early childhood that predispose childrenin the inner city towards a Th2 phenotype and place them at risk for the development of asthma.4. Aim 4. The Immunobiology of Cockroach Sensitization – The Role of T Cells in Disease andImmunotherapy is a mechanistic study designed to test the hypothesis that different T-cellresponses to epitopes from aeroallergens, in this case cockroach, are important in thedevelopment of allergic airway disease and to determine their roles in immunomodulation byimmunotherapy. The proposed work will involve extensive collaboration with Aims 1 and 6.5. Aim 5. Preventing Progression to Asthma in Pre-School Aged Inner City Children (PAPI). Thisprotocol is aimed at the prevention of progression from recurrent wheezing to asthma and willaddress the hypothesis that treatment of high-risk inner-city children with allergic sensitizationand recurrent wheeze with omalizumab, an intervention directed towards IgE, will alter diseaseprogression as reflected by a reduced prevalence of asthma 2 years after the completion ofomalizumab therapy.6. Aim 6. Cockroach (CR) Immunotherapy (IT) in Inner-City Asthma: Effects on Disease Activityand Progression. The primary objective of this protocol is to determine whether the addition ofcockroach (CR) subcutaneous immunotherapy (IT) to standard, guideline-directed asthmamanagement is superior to standard asthma care alone in the treatment of persistent asthma in PI: Jackson, Daniel J., et. al. - Project Summary Admin.

Furthermore, by focusing on younger children, we will also test a keysecondary hypothesis as to whether the addition of CR IT will lead to a long-term reduction inasthma severity and persistence.7. Aim 7. Asthma Phenotype Informed Protocol (APIP). This protocol is designed to determine ifthe addition of mepolizumab, anti-IL-5, to treatment of children with difficult-to-control asthmaand peripheral blood eosinophilia (>300 cells/mm3) will prevent exacerbations, improve diseasecontrol, and potentially prevent progression of disease.8. Aim 8. The Use of Long-acting Anti-Muscarinic Antagonist (LAMA) Therapy in an Asthma andObesity Phenotype in Inner-City Asthma. This protocol is designed to test the hypothesis thatasthmatic children/adolescents with a BMI >85th percentile have enhanced parasympatheticairway tone, which is related to higher plasma leptin concentration and, as a consequence, willhave a greater response to anticholinergic treatment than asthma patients with lower BMIs.

Age is a general riskfactor, though there is high-variance in the clinical course of COVID-19 in middle-aged patients,including mortality rates over 1% among patients in their 50's [3], [2]. Further, more than one quarter ofnon-survivors in a Wuhan study have no co-morbidities [1]. Non-survivors had elevated serum IL-6, andfeatures of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1], [2]. These findings have provided rationalefor initiation of trials to explore therapeutic efficacy of IL-1R and IL-6R blockade in COVID-19 [4]. Instudying epigenetic control of inflammatory genes, we have found that key immune genes in bloodprogenitors are variably regulated by epigenetic poising across individuals, with variability across age anddisease states. Herein, we aim to reveal specific genes, and epigenetic states of these genes, that mayunderlie morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 through use of sensitive epigenomic methods recentlydeveloped by the lab. This work will illuminate features of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and pathogenesis,which is of the utmost importance if we are to develop effective therapies and patient managementstrategies in a timely manner.

Effective treatments to attenuate such memories are scarce and the mechanisms behind successful memory extinction remain poorly understood. Moreover, with the exception of delayed behavioral assessments, reliable tools to measure the efficacy of extinction strategies for traumatic memories are currently missing. In this project, we aim to better understand remote memory extinction at a cell population-specific level and to develop a new tool to better gauge the efficacy of interventional strategies against remote fear memories. To achieve these goals, we will be using transgenic mice, which allow for inducible but persistent genetic tagging of neurons that are activated by remote memory recall. By visualizing this tag upon completion of successful memory extinction, we will first identify the neuronal subpopulations that are active during memory extinction. Next, by targeting this tag with pharmacological means to bidirectionally modulate the activity of these neurons, we will determine their causal implication in memory extinction. Lastly, by using this tag as bait, we will isolate fear extinction-relevant neurons for in-depth characterization of the molecular mechanisms associated with successful memory extinction. Here, particular emphasis will be given to the epigenetic regulation of gene expression, a fundamental process of long-lasting forms of memories. By investigating these mechanisms in two independent extinction protocols, we seek to provide proof-of-principle that successful methods of remote memory extinction are defined by a common molecular signature, which can serve as a future tool to rapidly and reliably ascertain the potential of novel treatments with the same purpose.Taken together, this project will deepen our understanding of remote fear memory extinction, and enlarge our toolbox to assess interventional strategies against traumatic memories.

Accumulating evidence suggests a similar role for mutation of epigenetic regulators in solid tumors. In prostate cancer, we discovered a genetically defined subclass of tumors characterized by point-mutations in SPOP (speckle-type POZ protein, a substrate-binding subunit of an E3 ubiquitin ligase) and deletions in CHD1 (chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 1). These alterations conceivably alter chromatin-related biological processes such as cell differentiation and genomic stability. However, the precise roles these mutated genes play in tumorigenesis, and any therapeutic implications, remain elusive. This proposal aims (i) to establish disease-relevant cell culture models for SPOP and CHD1-mutated tumors in order to (ii) study the biological function of these newly discovered mutations and (iii) to design therapeutic strategies for this new subtype of prostate cancer.

Proteins that control gene expression known as transcription factors (TFs) are central for specifying the first lineages appearing in the embryo, which include the pluripotent and extraembryonic lineages, and thus are excellent molecular candidates to establish differences between early cells. The Plachta laboratory recently established methods to image and quantify the dynamic behaviour of TFs in single cells of living mouse embryos. By applying these tools they demonstrated that distinct Oct4 kinetics predict the formation of the pluripotent and extraembryonic lineages in the embryo.A central question originating from this work is whether the establishment of different TF kinetic states represents a general mechanism used by cells of the early mouse embryo to decide their lineage fate in vivo. Here, I and the Plachta laboratory propose to address this question during my postdoctoral work following two specific Aims:AIM 1. We will determine whether the transcription factors Nanog, Cdx2, Gata4 and Gata6, which are known to be important for the formation of the pluripotent and extraembryonic lineages, exhibit kinetic differences between cells of the early mouse embryo.AIM 2. We will determine whether differences in the epigenetic state of cell nuclei impact on the kinetic behaviour of TFs in the early mouse embryo.

It is currently unknown how different subclasses of RNAs are involved in this information transfer, nor where they originate. This study aims at elucidating the mechanistic contribution of non-coding RNAs to the impact of environmental factors on the offspring. I will achieve this goal by analyzing the RNA expression and DNA methylation profile after an exposure to early life stress in germ cells (mice) and serum (mice and humans) of the exposed individuals using the well established MSUS mouse model (Franklin et al 2010) of early trauma and high throughput state of the art sequencing methods. Then, in sperm altered subclasses of RNAs of MSUS and control animals will be microinjected into fertilized oocytes of naïve females to screen for effects in the offspring similar to those reported for natural paternal line offspring of MSUS mice. Further, I propose to assess the functional relevance of serum RNAs, previously identified to be affected by early life stress.I expect to determine RNA subclasses that are relevant for transgenerational transmission of acquired information. Further, I hope to identify genomic target regions of these classes of RNAs, the time point when they act on their target, their mechanism of action and their relevance in serum. These findings will help to elucidate their contribution to the propagation of environmental signals impacting the organism and specifically the brain across generations. The foreseen study should finally contribute to diagnosis of environmentally compromised individuals. It will bring us one step further towards a mechanistic prevention of maladaptive alterations. Future studies could benefit from my expected findings to identifying epigenetic personalized drugs to reverse trauma induced alterations to protect potential offspring from an increased risk load to predisposition for diseases.

Such disorders are recognized to have a heritable component and run in families, however most do not have a clear genetic basis or any identified associated genomic loci. Instead, it is acknowledged that non-genetic components, in particular epigenetic processes, influenced by environmental factors strongly contribute to these diseases. Among these factors, negative environmental conditions such as stress or trauma early in life are thought to play an important role. In the past few years, the Mansuy laboratory has investigated this possibility and examined experimentally, how detrimental environmental conditions early in life persistently impact behavior in mice, and which mechanisms underlie the resulting behavioral changes. The lab approached this question by developing a mouse model for early stress based on unpredictable maternal separation combined with maternal stress. It demonstrated that this manipulation triggers severe and persistent depressive- and impulsive-like behaviors, and impairs social skills in adult mice. Further, these behavioral alterations were shown to be transmitted to the subsequent offspring, through at least two generations, even though the offspring itself was not exposed to any stress. Initial molecular analyses of this mouse model revealed that the epigenetic profile in the brain and germline of the stressed animals and their offspring is altered across generations, suggesting that the epigenome is involved in the inheritance of the behavioral alterations induced by early stress. The objectives of this proposal are to investigate this hypothesis, and examine the molecular underpinning of the impact of early stress on the epigenome across generations, and its potential reversibility. The major goals of the project are to:(1) Identify the genes which expression is altered by early stress in the mouse brain across generations.(2) Analyze the impact of early stress on DNA methylation in the brain and the germline across generations. (3) Determine whether the negative effect of early stress can be reversed.(4) Investigate the importance of non-coding RNAs in the effect of early stress.

It addresses fundamental questions in the evolution of interactions that take place inside families and mediate the regulation of parental care. Parent-offspring conflict and coadaptation are of prime interest for understanding the evolution of parental care as a basal form of social life, its genetic bases, evolutionary causes and consequences.Experimental projects:The evolution of parental care is a critical evolutionary transition for a species. Novel selection pressures arise because the optimal solution of the offspring number-quality trade-off can differ for parents and offspring, creating conflict and antagonistic selection on parental provisioning and offspring demand. Offspring can gain the potential to actively influence parental investment decisions, and the selection arising from parent-offspring conflict can favour the evolution of traits and behaviours that regulate the flow of resources from the caring parent to the developing offspring. Most experiments testing parent-offspring conflict tested if observed phenotypes were consistent with predictions from evolutionary models for the resolution of parent-offspring conflict. I propose experimental research in a sub-social insect species, the European earwig to directly test parent-offspring conflict by generating selection lines where caring females differ in their relative investment in current versus future reproduction and, hence, in how conflict over maternal investment is expected to shape maternal behaviours and offspring demand. Furthermore, our recent research revealed paternally inherited offspring influences on maternal investment. Evolutionary theory predicts such epigenetic influences if females only provide care to offspring, and if multiple mating reduces the average paternal relatedness of offspring of a given female (i.e., the “kinship theory of genomic imprinting”). Under these conditions, paternally inherited genes gain more from enhanced maternal investment than maternally inherited genes. I propose mating experiments to test if our results on paternally inherited offspring influences on maternal investment support the kinship theory of genomic imprinting, and how paternity of different males is shared within and between clutches of earwig females.Theoretical project:How conflict shapes the evolution of parental care and offspring demand has usually been modelled using game-theory. These resolution models either assumed parental control (“honest signalling”) or offspring control (“scramble competition models”), took parents and offspring as separate categories of individuals and, hence, assumed strategies of offspring and parents to be uncorrelated within individuals. In reality, however, parents and offspring are life-stages of individuals and parent-offspring interactions correspond to not usually fit a simple parent or offspring control scenario. The typically highly repetitive interactions of parents and offspring resemble more a behavioural negotiation process. Quantitative genetic coadaptation models explicitly treated parents and offspring as life-stages of individuals, and predict that strategies for demanding care as offspring and providing care as parent are expected to often be genetically correlated. But these models have not been incorporated into a full functional context of parental care and parent-offspring conflict. Here, I propose a collaborative project with Rufus Johnstone (University of Cambridge) to attempt to develop and mathematically integrate a game-theoretic parent-offspring negotiation model with a quantitative genetic coadaptation model.The theoretical and experimental study systems:All experimental projects are carried out in the European earwig (Forficula auricularia), an insect species where females provide care for offspring. Our experiments test predictions derived from general evolutionary principles. The European earwig is an excellent experimental model system to test these predictions, but the obtained results are in principle also of relevance to higher organisms, including humans. The theoretical project will use both game-theoretic and evolutionary quantitative genetic modelling techniques.	Swiss National Science Foundation	SNSF Professorships	763934.0	CHF

While a qualitative understanding of signals, and their connection to cellular outputs has been established, plasticity and feedback of signaling networks remain obscured. A better understanding of dynamic and locally constrained signaling events driving organ development and disease progression requires access to refined subcellular probe detection. The availability of optogenetic and chemical biology tools provides novel opportunities, but requires dedicated microscopy equiment. For this reason, six projects at the Department of Biomedicine (DBM) and the Biocenter (BC) of the Univerisity of Basel i) localized lipid signaling in disease (M. Wymann, DBM); ii) dynamic subcellular Wnt/ß-catenin signaling in epithelial mesenchymal transition (G. Christofori, DBM); iii) DNA dynamics and confined epigenetic plasticity (P. Schär, DBM); iv) real-time monitoring of Sonic Hedgehog and Bone Morphogenetic Protein gradients in limb buds (R. Zeller, DBM); v) ultrastructural analysis of neuronal stem cell control (V. Taylor, DBM); and vi) molecular mechanisms determining the development of vascular networks (M. Affolter, BC), illustrate the need of the requested “subcellular targeting microscopy” equipment. The core of the platform is a highly sensitive microlens-enhanced spinning disk microscope linked to FRAP, ablation, and multiple excitation laser lines, and an integrated TIRF module to monitor plasma membrane events. Through its integration into the BioOptics core facility at the DBM, the subcellular targeting platform will be accessible to >500 regional researchers at the University of Basel, DBM, FMI, D-BSSE, Fachhochschule, etc. An image storage and analysis pipeline with remote user access capabilitiy is in place, to allow seamless operation and output.The requested equipment will allow the use of genetically encoded opto-genetic proteins, proteins tagged for reactivity with chemical inducers of dimerisation (CIDs), and the possibility to perform FRAP/TIRF and FRAP/confocal microscopy, and will greatly enhance the possibilities to manipulate and track subcellular localization of target proteins. The insights gained by these experimental approaches will be critical for a better understanding of dynamic biological processes, and will spur the design of innovative therapeutic approaches to counter-act resistance mechanisms in oncology.

The project will test the hypothesis that epigenetic pronuclear patterns and parental assymmetries are actively maintained in the zygote and that a sequence of changes in histone methylation levels is required for the onset of gene activation. The experiments will employ in vitro culture of mouse zygotes to assess the effects of histone methyltransferase and demethylase inhibitors on preimplantation development, downstream epigenetic markers and early gene expression timing. The goal is to obtain more information on the mechanism through the use of small molecule inhibitors of key steps in the reprogramming process. The study aims to progress understanding of zygotic programming mechanisms that are essential for early development. The results will be relevant to human embryology and assisted reproduction, and will contribute insights applicable to somatic cell reprogramming for regenerative medicine.

Despite the research community's efforts little or no evidence of a genetic predisposition can be identified. Meanwhile the incidence of IBDs has been increasing, especially in western and westernised countries. Epigentics poses an interesting research target for finding the link between environmental changes and the incidence of IBDS. It has already been shown to effect gene expression in other systems and could prove key in linking our environment to the observation of the IBD phenotype. DNA methylation is one of the most widely researched epigenetic mechanisms to date, and involves the attachment of a methyl group to the 5' position on the pyrimidine ring of the nitrogenous base, Cytosine. Through increased methylation, the chromatin state is repressed and transcription is inhibited. Patients with IBDs exhibit a distinct isolated distribution of inflammation, suggesting that molecular changes have occured within the specfic gut segment. We intend to use isolated DNA and RNA from gut biopses to test the hypothesis that aberrant DNA methylation in the intestinal epithelium is either the cause and/or contributes to the observed relapsing, inflammatory phenotype in patients with IBD.

Among factors that determine salt-sensitivity hereditary or acquired defects in renal function, endogenous inhibitors of Na,K-ATPase (endogenous ouabain, marinobufagenin) have been considered. The major aims of the study are: 1) To investigate potential relationships between circulating levels of MBG and ouabain and development of salt-sensitive hypertension; 2) To determine contribution of putative genetic factors to variation of MBG and ouabain plasma concentration in an ethnically homogeneous sample of pedigrees. Materials and Mehods: Data collected in 80 Georgian families (350-400 individuals) will be collected. Salt sensitivity will be assessed by the difference of mean arterial pressure (MAP=3mmHg)) on high (200 mmol/day) vs. low (40 mmol/day) salt diet. The determination of circulating levels of endogenous sodium pump inhibitors and other relevant traits in blood plasma and in urine will be carried out using the ELISA and RIA methods. Extraction of DNA from blood samples will be conducted according to extraction and purification of DNA protocols by commercially available kit (PAXgene, Germany). Genotyping of relevant candidate genes will be performed at Lithuanian partner Genotyping Facility using Taqman or seqeunom. Creatinine clearance (CrC), SPI clearance, Na filtered, and Fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) will be assessed. Due to the sampling design, the present study is a family-based analysis of the salt-sensitive hypertension associated phenotypes. The effect of age and other covariates (such as sex, smoking, and occupation) on each of the phenotypes will be assessed taking into account family size and structure.Swiss team will be represented by Professor M.Burnier (main applicant) from the University of Lausanne, Switzerland has had many years of experience in the area of the blood pressure and renal function in particular, examining the relationship renal sodium handling and blood pressure response to salt in health and disease. Georgian team members (Team Leader Prof. G.Simonia) from the Tbilisi State Medical University and Institute of Medical Biotechnology have a good knowledge of the salt-sensitive hypertension, predictors, cardiovascular diseases as they have been intensively studying risk factors of the development hypertension, obesity and other age-related disease.Lithuanian team members (Team Leader - Prof. A. Pivoriunas) at the Institute of Experimental and Clinical medicine have an extensive experience in isolation, propagation and analysis of different primary cell lines as well as epigenetic mechanisms controlling differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. The proposed study is a unique research opportunity to simultaneously investigate the effect of key factors (genetic, and life style) that contribute to the normal variation of salt-sensitive hypertension associated with major endogenous sodium inhibitors and cardiovascular profile in an ethnically homogeneous sample of families.

They are notorious for their escape from therapy attributed to the multitude of affected pathways, acquisition of tumor stem cell properties and tumor heterogeneity. It has become clear that single agent therapies systematically fail in this disease and new strategies for targeted combination therapies are urgently needed. The dependency of cancer cells on the interplay between aberrant changes of the epigenetic landscape and genetic alterations is rapidly emerging. Key elements associated with deregulation of gene expression have been associated with epigenetic reprogramming comprising epigenetic silencing of key genes mediated by DNA methylation and modulation of chromatin. These new insights need to be followed upon and translated into new treatment strategies. First, pathways affected by epigenetic alterations are potentially targetable and second, interference with the epigenetic machinery may allow reprogramming the epigenome - both strategies seem promising and require respective research. In this proposal we aim at addressing the question of functional contribution of the epigenetic landscape to the malignant behaviour of GBM in order to identify novel drug combination strategies for personalized therapy. In Project A we aim at targeting epigenetic regulation in tumors. The clinical development of potent inhibitors of chromatin “readers”, namely bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) proteins that seem to be promising targets in hematopoietic malignancies, and potentially also in solid tumours including gliomas.- A first in class drug (OTX015) is now tested in an international phase I/II trial in recurrent GBM in which we participate. - Our approach aims at disturbing the system by using BET inhibitors, identify disturbed pathways which we hypothesize should be informative for potential vulnerabilities that may be targeted with a second drug. The project entails (i) identification of gene expression signatures induced by BET inhibitors; (ii) mapping of the genomic location of key histone modifications, and of key members of BET protein signalling (BRD4, MED1) in GBM derived sphere lines that retain cancer stem cell like properties, using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq); (iii) Integration of the acquired data with publically available cell-line / drug response data to propose targets and respective compounds to be combined with BET inhibitors; (iv) followed by rigorous validation of these predictions using a targeted ShRNA-screen and functional analyses in our in vitro sphere line models and in patient-derived xenografts. This integrated effort is expected to yield a number of combination therapies and respective biomarkers that will be further translated to our existing clinical trial networks.In Project B we entertain the question whether epigenetic/genetic profiles imply distinct treatment approaches based on the pathways they affect - with the specific question of epigenetic differences in GBM of elderly patients whose tumors are poorly characterized. Elderly GBM patients represent a growing patient population who are frequently excluded from clinical trials. For this purpose we have determined the methylome and gene copy alterations in a clinical trial population of elderly GBM patients (n=130), which we confront to our dataset from an adult GBM trial population (n>200), and external datasets. This data will also serve as input into Project A of this proposal.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div. I-III)	510323.0	CHF

We have established molecular profiles of glioblastoma obtained from patients treated within a clinical trial comprising gene expression, genomic copy number aberrations (aCGH), and the promoter methylation status of the repair gene MGMT that we have previously shown to be predictive for benefit from alkylating agent therapy. At present we are obtaining genome-wide methylation data using MBD2 ChIP sequencing and using the Infinium 450K-methylation BeadChip. The latter comprises 90% of the probes used in a large public data base (27K BeadChip) for glioblastoma, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, hence allows to extend to the respective data of approximately 300 glioblastoma. Objectives include (i) classification of tumors according to their molecular profiles, (ii) identification of predictive factors for survival and response to respective therapy, (iii) insights into underlying molecular mechanisms involved in the evolution of brain tumors and their resistance to therapy, and (iv) discovery of new molecular targets for future therapies. Furthermore, efforts need to evaluate the relevance of tumor stem-like cells that are suspected to be important for the biological behavior of the tumors and consequently are relevant for treatment response. Based on results of the first analysis of the molecular profiles we propose to investigate the following aspects relevant for biology and treatment of glioma: (A) we aim at investigating genome-wide epigenetic deregulation of genes implicated in resistance to therapy in glioblastoma and low grade glioma, by analyzing tumors from patients treated in respective phase III clincial trials. In addition we investigate paired samples of glioblastoma and respective glioma derived spheres that are enriched for glioma initiating cells (GICs), as there is some evidence that they may be regulated differently. The epigenetic profiles will be interrogated for specific biological pathways suspected to be involved in resistance to therapy, and pathways that may be targeted by drugs already available or in development. We will in particular focus on a previously identified signature, HOX gene signature that is epigenetically deregulated and associated with therapy resistance. And (B) we investigate the role of two new potential tumor suppressor genes we have identified to be targeted in glioblastoma by deletion and /or epigenetic inactivation, WIF1 and USP15.Combining interactive experimental approaches with molecular information derived from human tumors in association with respective clinical information provides a powerful tool for better comprehension of gliomas. The ability to identify subgroups of patients who are most likely to benefit from specific therapies are an important step towards individually tailored therapies.

Typical heterochromatic regions are landmark chromosome structures, such as centromeres and telomeres. Heterochromatin is epigenetically inherited and is critical for preserving genomic integrity but also for stable inheritance of gene silencing during development and differentiation. Failure to retain these silent domains causes diseases such as cancers, developmental abnormalities, and neurological disorders. The initiation and spreading of heterochromatin silencing at centromeres relies on the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery. The RNAi machinery takes advantage of the heterochromatic transcription of the centromeric dg/dh repeats by the RNA polymerase II to generate small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), resulting in sequence specific recruitment of several interacting protein complexes and histone-modifying enzymes.It appears that centromeric non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play a central role in heterochromatin assembly. They are the precursors of RNAi-mediated siRNA generation and act as targeting scaffolds to direct chromatin-modifying complexes to specific chromatin loci. This mechanism of ncRNA regulation of chromatin states in a locus specific fashion is conserved throughout evolution. Indeed, long ncRNAs in higher eukaryotes are key regulators in the assembly of repressive heterochromatic domains for vital developmental pathways such as dosage compensation, imprinting, and developmental gene expression. However, the mechanistic details of processes involved are still largely unknown. This project is aimed at dissecting the mechanism(s) by which centromeric ncRNAs orchestrate epigenetic regulation at centromeres in S. pombe. Efforts will be directed towards: (1) identifying the centromeric sequences required to guide the recruitment of chromatin-modifying proteins initiating the epigenetic cascade that promotes centromeric silencing, (2) defining the characteristics of a siRNA-generating locus, and (3) discovering new factors that work together with the RNAi machinery to assemble heterochromatin.We expect our work to provide a mechanistic framework for understanding the key steps in heterochromatin formation. Not only will this allow a better understanding of heterochromatin inheritance and genomic integrity in the fission yeast S. pombe, but also it will serve as a general paradigm in higher eukaryotes where RNAi and chromatin modifications are also present and connected. Finally, the proposed project should contribute to the understanding of human diseases associated with heterochromatin dysfunction such as cancers or Trinucleotide repeat expansion diseases (TREDs), including Friedreich’s Ataxia.

T cell cross priming (the initiation of CD8+ T cell responses to antigen that are not expressed by dendritic cells, DCs) requires the phagocytosis of antigens by DCs and their presentation on MHC class I molecules, a process referred to as “cross presentation”. Here, we propose a series of integrated approaches to address the most fundamental mechanisms of cross presentation and explore the use of this process for translational purposes in human cancer. This proposal will pursue three main objectives: 1) To analyze the mechanisms of control of antigen cross presentation and phagocytic functions in DCs. We will use genome wide screens and conditional KO mice, associated to quantitative assays for phagosomal functions and cross presentation, to investigate the molecular mechanisms of cross presentation in vitro and in vivo. 2) To study the epigenetic programing of cross presentation during the ontogeny of mouse DC subpopulations. We will define a “cross presentation gene signature” that will be validated by systematic gene silencing in vitro and we will analyze the epigenetic basis of control of cross presentation-related genes developing DCs. 3) To investigate the regulation of cross presentation in human primary DCs and to develop translational approaches in cancer. We will study cross presentation and phagosome functions in primary human DC subpopulations and its regulation by innate receptors for the development of original immunomodulation and vaccination strategies. We will explore the use of DCs cross presentation abilities in solid tumor infiltrating DCs and their use for prognosis in cancer. The results of this project will unravel fundamental mechanisms of phagocytosis and its control by innate signals in mice and humans. The proposal also aims at defining new possible strategies for cancer treatment and prognosis.	European Research Council	Advanced Grant	2500000.0	EUR

Certain non-coding regulatory sequences, called enhancers, bind to gene promoters and act as molecular switches to regulate gene expression during development. The recent explosion in genomics data has revealed epigenetic features that correlate with the active state of enhancers; however, little is known about the molecular events that are required to establish enhancer activity, as it has proven difficult to manipulate the ‘on’ and ‘off’ states of these sequences in vivo. To address this issue, we propose to develop a novel technology that allows for rapid and reversible silencing of transcriptional enhancers in living cells. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and small molecule chemical inducers of proximity, we will be able to modify the epigenetic state of a given enhancer, enabling us to switch target gene expression on and off. Further, because this system allows precise temporal control we will be able to define and model the biochemical sequence of events that lead to both the establishment and dissolution of enhancer-promoter choices. With the insights gained from these mechanistic studies, we can apply these observations to many pressing biological questions. We aim to repress neuronal enhancers during neural stem cell differentiation to determine their functional contribution to neural cell identity, as well as test the therapeutic potential of this approach by silencing oncogenic enhancers to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells.

The expression of this BABA-induced resistance (BABA-IR) coincides with a faster and stronger defense response following pathogen attack or abiotic stress. This phenomenon has been termed “priming, sensitization or potentiation”, and the underlying mechanisms are starting to become clearer. Priming has been proposed to be based on the accumulation of signalling proteins in an inactive form that would then be activated upon exposure to stress. Another suggestion was the accumulation of transcription factors in primed plants leading to an enhanced defense gene transcription when this plant is stressed and, recently, evidence has been pointing to changes at the epigenetic level. We have previously isolated mutants of Arabidopsis impaired in the expression of BABA-IR. Besides demonstrating that there is a genetic basis for the observed induced resistance and priming, the analysis of these mutants also allowed to start dissecting the signalling pathways involved in the phenomenon, demonstrating that BABA-IR against biotic and abiotic stresses is based on priming of distinct defense signaling mechanisms involving salicylic acid-, abscisic acid-, and phosphoinositide-dependent pathways and that callose deposition plays an important role. Here, we propose to take advantage of the recently established Chemical Analysis Platform at our university and ensuing expertise to look at the fate of BABA in plants, i.e. determine its perseverance, concentration and possible catabolism and to develop a sensitive, accurate methodology to determine hormones and their conjugates as well as other metabolite levels in plants. Such methods will enable us to determine the role of fine-tuning of the hormonal homeostasis during BABA-IR and induced resistance in general. Conjugation of hormones is a way of controlling the cellular level of these substances and we have preliminary results showing that conjugation reactions might contribute to BABA-IR as well as basic immunity of Arabidopsis against Pseudomonas syringae.In a second approach we propose to investigate the duration of induced resistance and priming after an inducing treatment. Our own results as well as recent presentations by colleagues at scientific meetings point to the possibility that the primed state might be transferred to the descendants of primed plants. Here we propose to establish whether this is the case for different IR systems and against various biotic and abiotic stresses. We plan to screen WT populations of Arabidopsis for accessions showing a “hypo- or hyper-long-time priming” phenotype in view of establishing the genetic basis. We will also investigate the dependency of the phenomenon on defined signalling pathways and genes known to be central for the expression of IR. Finally, we will determine whether there is a possibility that the observed phenomenon is due to transfer of BABA or derivates, or of an eventual bacteria-generated or induced molecule through the seeds to the next generation. If the observed trans-generation priming can be unequivocally attributed to a transfer of the primed state to the descendants of a plant, our results and generated plant populations will be the starting point for later investigations into the molecular mechanisms behind the observed phenomenon.Priming-inducing events or treatments conferring enhanced resistance against both biotic and abiotic stresses with minimal inhibitory effects on commercially important traits are of interest to have a means of transferring useful adaptations to a following generation, both in natural as in agricultural ecosystems.

1294	Bruno Gottstein	University of Berne	Institut für Parasitologie Universität Bern	2015-04-01	2018-03-31	Search for novel immuno- and chemotherapeutical approaches to treat alveolar echinococcosis	SUMMARY OF RESEARCH PLAN a) Background: Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is one of the clinically most severe zoonotic helminthic diseases in humans, characterized by a chronic progressive hepatic damage caused by the continuous proliferation of the larval stage (metacestode) of Echinococcus multilocularis. The proliferative potential of the parasite metacestode tissue is dependent on the nature/function of the periparasitic immune-mediated processes of the host. Immune tolerance and/or down-regulation of immunity are a marked characteristic increasingly observed at the chronic (late) stage of infection in both humans and in ex¬perimentally infected mice. In this context, explorative studies have clearly shown that T regulatory (Treg) cells play an important role in modulating and orchestrating inflammatory/immune reactions in AE, yielding a largely Th2-biased response, and finally allowing thus long-term parasite survival, prolif¬eration and maturation. b) Working hypothesis and specific aims: We hypothesize that metacestodes secrete immunomod¬ulatory metabolites into the periparasitic environment, and thus create a rather anergic, compromised immunological situation. The parasite makes use of regulatory factors that are employed by Tregs to conventionally antagonize excessive immune responses. Our objectives are (i) to elucidate the respec¬tive cytokine network in detail to define how the expression of these regulatory factors is controlled, and to characterize parameters that could be exploited for the development of novel immunotherapeutic approaches; (ii) to assess the (putatively beneficial) influence of E. multilocularis infection, and conse¬quently of parasite secretory immunomodulatory metabolites, on the course of auto-immune disease (as exemplified in an inducible colitis model); and (iii) to validate recently identified drug targets, and to perform proof-of-concept studies in mice to demonstrate the feasibility, and possibly increased efficacy, of combined immuno- and chemotherapeutical approaches to achieve cure of AE in affected patients. c) Experimental design and/or methods: We have earlier shown that fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2) produced by Tregs plays a major role in the immunomodulatory events that characterize AE. We will explore the effects of in vivo FGL2 neutralization in mice using monoclonal antibodies, and will assess the role of FGL2 in human patients by serological analysis of defined patient groups. The role of Treg cells will be analyzed in more detail using the DEREG mouse model that allows in vivo depletion of Tregs at defined time points during infection, and we will define the factors that account for the down¬regulation / modulation of periparasitic immunity. The regulation of Foxp3 expression, the master reg¬ulator of Treg differentiation, and the role of epigenetic factors (such as long non-coding RNAs that mediate DNA- or histone-methylation) in coordinating Foxp3 expression will be analyzed. In addition, we will investigate the influence of parasite infection on the pathology and immunoregulation in an in¬ducible mouse colitis model for intestinal bowel disease (IBD). In order to develop novel therapeutical treatment options for AE we will, as a first priority, perform a detailed characteriza¬tion of the Echinococcus proteasome by in silico analysis of its constituents, validation by RNAi, purifi¬cation of proteasomes and functional assays, and immunolocalization and expression analysis of defined constituents during infection and treatment). As second priority, we will investigate two other interesting potential drug targets, ferritin and calmodulin. d) Expected value of the proposed project: This project is a logical follow-up of earlier findings on the immunomodulatory properties of E. multilocularis metacestodes. The identification of parasite fac¬tors that interfere in the immune response (such as EmP29, EmG11, Em492 and others), and the novel insights on the importance of Tregs and FGL2 in orchestrating immunological events during AE in favor of the parasite, in combination with the notion that novel and interesting drugs and drug targets are being validated, has now opened the door for a more targeted therapeutic approach. This approach aims to combine immunotherapy with existing, and novel, chemotherapeutical tools.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div. I-III)	756000.0	CHF

However, more than 80% of the genome is developmentally transcribed into non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Formerly described as “junk”, ncRNAs have been recently assigned important roles in many developmental and oncogenic processes. Mechanistically, ncRNAs bind directly to DNA, or form complexes with other RNAs or proteins to regulate expression of genes. One of the best-characterized ncRNA-interacting proteins is the histone-methyltransferase EZH2, the catalytic subunit of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). RIP-seq analysis demonstrated that this epigenetic regulator binds more than 9000 RNAs. Interestingly, about 20% of the EZH2-interacting transcripts derive from repetitive genomic loci including Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements (SINEs). This interaction was initially neglected due to repetitive origin of the SINE transcripts. However, the latest study performed in the Lee Lab re-evaluated this binding and proposed a novel role for EZH2 and SINE-derived B2 RNA in shaping cellular adaptation to heat-shock. Prior to stress, B2 transcripts bind multiple heat-shock responsive genes and serve as speed bumps for RNA Polymerase II (POL-II). Upon heat-shock, however, EZH2 is recruited to the B2 RNA binding sites and destabilizes the RNA, thereby activating high-level expression of the heat-responsive genes to induce the adaptation programs. Unexpectedly, as a mechanism responsible for B2 RNA-destabilization, the study proposes a novel endonucleolytic activity for the histone-methyltransferase EZH2. These findings are very unexpected in two ways. First, they demonstrate an in vivo function for the repetitive RNA, B2, and show that B2 binds to chromatin and influences transcription. Second, they suggest that EZH2 - previously known only as a histone methyltransferase - may have RNAse activity. Thus, this study opens several important questions and these questions will be the focal point of my postdoctoral work. First, I would like to understand the mechanism of EZH2-mediated processing of B2 RNA. Second, I will study whether the EZH2-B2 mechanism is engaged to regulate responses to other stress-stimuli, including hypoxia and ER stress, and in mouse models of cancer. Lastly, given that EZH2 is mutated in multiple human malignancies I will address whether some mutations arise as a mechanism by which malignant cells can evade the stresses occurring in tumors. These aims will add to my scientific skill set by providing training in RNA-protein biochemistry and RNA-based epigenomic analysis, at the same time that they will utilize my PhD training in the organismal response to cancer stress.

Several observations made when systemic sclerosis (SSc, scleroderma) is taken as a disease model of fibrosis indicate that the adaptive immune response and in particular T cells may be at play. First, inflammatory infiltrates rich in T cells are readily observable in target organs early in the disease course and adjacent fibroblasts have high collagen synthesis. Second, immune response genes polymorphisms have been shown to be preferentially associated to SSc by unbiased genome wide screening. Third, high-dose immunosuppression appears to be a viable strategy to control severe SSc. Within this framework, we have participated to the characterization of T helper cells in SSc and sequentially found that Th2-like cells are present in SSc skin, that Th17 cells are abundant in SSc peripheral blood and for the first time observed that Th22 cells are also increased in frequency, particularly so in SSc with interstitial lung disease. In parallel studies we have shown that ligands of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) potently favor the polarization toward Th22 cells, concomitantly inhibiting Th17 cells. The aims outlined in this proposal are designed to further pursuing the analysis of the role of T helper cells with polarized phenotype in their complex relationship with fibroblasts in the context of fibrosis. The strategy proposed to tackle this issue is based on combined in vivo/ex vivo and in vitro approaches. Fibroblasts from both SSc and healthy individuals will be submitted to the influence of pure Th17 and Th22 cells. Fibroblast responses will be assessed in terms of extracellular matrix deposition and inflammatory mediators production. Immunohistological methods will be employed to identify IL-17 and IL-22 producing cells and their topographical relationship to myofibroblasts in SSc and healthy skin. Concomitantly, T cells will be grown in vitro from SSc and healthy skin and to assess their functional phenotype. The antigen-specificity of SSc-skin populating Th22 cells will be determined based on the recent description of preferential CD1a-restricted autoreactivity of Th22 cells. Clinical correlates of T helper subsets distribution will be sought by comparing their frequencies in SSc with established organ involvement and very early in disease course when only Raynaud’s phenomenon and characteristic autoantibody are present. Importantly, similar analysis will be conducted in SLE individuals with active or quiescent disease, to verify whether Th cell abnormalities are specific to SSc or shared by SLE, which may point to their relevance to auto-immunity at large. Parallel studies will be devoted to better understand the mechanisms involved in IL-22 gene regulation in T helper cells both at the transcriptional and epigenetic levels. Overall, the objective is to unravel novel mechanisms relevant to pathological events specifically leading to or protecting from fibrosis in order to identify new therapeutic targets.

Throughout their life cycle, plants undergo several developmental phase transitions producing new physiological states (e.g. dormancy), organs (e.g. flowers) or specialized cells (e.g. gametes) that were not established at embryogenesis. Critically, these transitions are associated with large-scale and dynamic event of chromatin reorganization. Current efforts are aiming at establishing the causal link between these events and cell fate acquisition. During our former SNF-funded project, we have shown that the somatic-to-reproductive fate transition in Arabidopsis is associated with chromatin reprogramming which partly establishes the post-meiotic, gametophytic fate. H1 depletion from the chromatin of spore mother cells is the earliest event of chromatin reprogramming. No canonical H1 variants is detectable throughout the female gametophyte and embryogenesis, raising the question of the function of this particular chromatin state, particularly with regard to epigenetic reprogramming. We now aim at elucidating (i) the mechanisms and role of H1 dynamics in plant reproduction and (ii) the role of putative germline specific H1-related variants. We will use molecular genetics approaches, notably to misregulate H1 variants in a conditional and cell-specific manner, together with standard techniques in developmental biology to analyse subtle developmental and cell fate alterations in the mutants, but also high-resolution imaging of fluorescent reporters and chromatin markers, as well as transcriptome studies and FRAP analyses of the H1 variants to assess their chromatin binding properties. Collectively, this project will provide the first insight on the developmental role of H1 dynamics during cellular reprogramming in plants.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div.

One major challenge impeding development of effective therapeutics is the heterogeneity of the tumor, which consists of various different cell types. In addition to the cellular heterogeneity of individual tumors, genomic studies have revealed a large variability between different GBM tumors. Global gene expression comparisons led to the identification of four distinct GBM subtypes, named classical, neural, proneural and mesenchymal, which were demonstrated to be predictive for patient outcome. Remarkably, a recent study showed that most patients displayed different subtypes within the same tumor, a finding with wide ramifications for therapeutic strategies.To gain a deeper understanding of intratumor heterogeneity and tumor-relevant cell types in GBM I propose to characterize and compare the proneural and mesenchymal subtypes. The goal of the proposed study is to achieve a better characterization of how epigenetically-distinct subtypes within a tumor evolve and interchange. This will be accomplished through global analysis of subtype-specific epigenetic landscapes, transcription factors and non-coding RNAs followed by rigorous experimental validation. These new insights should facilitate the identification of new therapeutic targets and biomarkers relevant to individual cellular subtypes in GBM.

Base excision repair (BER) is the predominant pathway to resolve these otherwise mutagenic, cytotoxic and genome-destabilizing base lesions, thereby maintaining the chemical integrity of DNA and protecting cells from a rapid decay of genetic information. BER is initiated by DNA glycosylases that specifically recognize and excise base lesions, thus generating an abasic site, which is further processed by downstream BER factors to restore the original base pair. Although DNA glycosylases are perfectly equipped to support genome integrity through DNA repair, accumulating evidence supports their involvement not only in genome, but also in epigenome maintenance. We have shown recently for the first time that one DNA glycosylase, Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG), is involved in safeguarding the functional integrity of gene regulatory regions by selectively binding to CG-rich DNA regions which are known for their involvement in the regulation of many genes. Specifically, the structural properties of TDG to recruit chromatin modifying enzymes and its DNA repair function mediated by its glycosylase activity cooperatively contribute to the establishment and maintenance of proper epigenetic states during embryonic development. Recent evidence supports an effect of oxidative DNA damage and its repair on the modulation of epigenetic states, i.e. a function beyond mere DNA repair. Yet, it is not known, whether DNA glycosylases repairing such lesions are involved in such modulations through their structural and/or enzymatic properties. Aim of the prosed project is to investigate this problem for the NEIL superfamily of DNA glycosylases. Cell biological, biochemical and structural experiments with NEIL enzymes as well as preliminary behavioural studies with NEIL deficient mice indicate that this family of DNA glycosylases might have this suspected function, i.e. to actively and specifically control epigenetic states. To this end, I will investigate the role of oxidative base damage and its repair initiated by NEIL DNA glycosylases in modulating epigenetic phenotypes. I will make use of NEIL knockout mice available in the host laboratory to investigate the impact of NEIL deficiency on neurodegeneration induced by oxidative DNA damage and on subsequent neurogenesis. I will examine single, double and triple NEIL mutant mice for alterations in gene expression patterns in an attempt to correlate them with changes in the chromatin status, using chromatin and DNA immunoprecipitation techniques. Advanced DNA sequencing should further reveal NEIL function in regulating differentiation-associated gene expression programs through the repair of oxidative base lesions.With classical biochemical and proteomics approaches I aim to investigate the mechanisms governing NEIL dependent epigenetic control and will address the contribution of structural and catalytic properties of NEIL proteins on genome and epigenome maintenance. I expect that his study will provide novel insights into the function of DNA repair in modulating the interaction between environmental signals, genetics and epigenetics to ultimately contribute to proper organismal development.

Thus, improving T cell functionality in chronic infections and tumors has been a major research focus in the past years resulting in the development of checkpoint inhibitor therapies that have fundamentally changed our approach to cancer and chronic infections. The aim of this proposed research project is to delineate the transcriptional and epigenetic attributes regulating a long-term T cell response with the intention to provide novel strategies to improve therapeutic efficacy. We will take advantage of state-of-the-art gene-editing approaches to modulate T cell differentiation programs through conditional deletion of transcriptional or epigenetic regulators after establishing a chronic T cell response. Likewise, we will specifically delete individual regulatory elements disrupting a particular transcription factor-mediated regulation. We will study transcriptional networks, which may be highly beneficial and relevant for the search of new strategies to target and improve established T cell responses to chronic infections or tumors. Overall, we describe a sequence of studies that will provide crucial and novel insights into the continuous role of transcriptional and epigenetic regulators in a persistent T cell response.

Therefore, this cell population is critical for vertebrate development and defects in the development of tissues derived from the NC, known collectively as neurocristopathies in humans, can be severely debilitating. However, the genes found to be associated with such defects are sometimes difficult to relate to NC specification process. For instance, the DiGeorge syndrome, well-characterized by defects in NC-related organs, has been associated to Tbx1, which is not expressed in NC.Despite extensive efforts, it has remained difficult to fully characterize the molecular and regulatory events at stake in this elusive cell population. Though genomic technologies as Chip-seq or RNA-seq have proven extremely powerful to untangle complex regulatory interactions, their application to the developmental processes in general and NC cells in particular is difficult because cells of interest are intermingled among other differentiating organs and tissues. To circumvent this limitation, my future host laboratory has developed a new technique to selectively isolate NC cell populations using in vivo biotinylation driven by NC-specific enhancers in transgenic zebrafish embryos, and furthermore adapted biochemical tools for small cell populations including micro ChiP amplification-seq, biotin-Chip-seq and RNA-seq on small cell numbers. Here, we propose to take advantage of these novel and exciting advances to carry out cell-type specific epigenetic and transcriptional profiling of migrating NC-derived cells, comparing wild-type and Tbx1 mutant context. We will particularly focus in the alterations of cis-regulatory landscape and shifts in gene regulatory networks associated with the Tbx1 mutant. By this way, we hope to better understand how the interplay between NC and their surrounding context affects their regulatory state throughout their migration and differentiation.

It is concerned with the elucidation of those mechanisms underlying the long-range and coordinated transcriptional control of clusters of Hox genes. The ultimate aim of this research is to understand the origin, evolution and implementation of collinear Hox gene regulation in two different developmental contexts, the major axis and the appendicular axis. Several approaches are used, all relying on mammalian and molecular genetics and generally based on the large amount of mutant stocks we accumulated during the last three rounds of SNF funding. In summary, we would like to look at the importance of both the distribution of ‘epigenetic’ chromatin marks and the presence of natural or artificial antisense RNAs in the control of collinearity. We also would like to assess the respective weights of cluster-internal versus external factors in this critical regulation during trunk extension by using range of deletions and inversions affecting the flanking gene deserts, as well as to see the behavior of Hox gene clusters from other species implementing collinearity with some differences, whenever Hox clusters are introduced into the mouse. In the case of the limbs, where the mechanisms are likely distinct, we want to directly visualize its implementation by 3D-DNA FISH. We also want to analyze the situation into two different types of animals with various limb morphologies (with respect to the relative position of the mesopodium) to see if our recent understanding of the mouse mechanism can be integrated into an evolutionary framework, i.e. if our recent work has a heuristic value when thinking about the evolution of vertebrate limbs	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div.

SummaryThe vascular endothelium forms an anti-coagulant interface between blood and tissue. It plays a key role in hemostasis, inflammation and the regulation of vascular tone. Dysfunction or inappropriate (inflammatory) activation of endothelial cells (EC) is a major factor in cardiovascular disease. Non-stimulated EC express anti-aggregant, anti-coagulant and pro-fibrinolytic activities. These assure that thrombus formation does not occur on an intact, non-activated endothelium. Within hours after inflammatory activation, EC change their phenotype from anti-coagulant to pro-coagulant and reduce their fibrinolytic activity by decreasing expression of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and increasing production of the principal t-PA inhibitor, PAI-1. In recent years the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in regulating gene expression has become increasingly evident. All cells of an organism have an identical genome, but expression of individual genes need to be adapted to the requirements of each cell type and to be appropriate with respect to the environment of the organisms. Epigenetic changes are a means to annotate the unchanged genome and form the interface between the cellular environment and the transcriptional needs. Epigenetic changes include DNA methylation, mainly of CpG dimers, which are associated with transcriptional inactivation of a gene and histone modifications, which change the chromatin such as to favor or repress gene expression. DNA methyl transferases are important for maintaining DNA methylation in dividing cells or for de novo DNA methylation during development or in response to environmental signals. Gene activity is modulated by a large number of histone modifications, the so called “histone code”. Acetylation of histones 3 and 4 is associated with gene activation and is regulated by the opposing action of histone acetyl transferases (HAT) and histone deacetylases (HDAC). Results presented elsewhere as well as our preliminary results indicate that of HDAC inhibition strongly increases the expression of t-PA and depending on the HDAC inhibitor used has no effect or moderately increases PAI-1 expression.The principal aim of the project is to better understand the epigenetic mechanisms, in particular the role of HDAC and HAT that regulate cell-type specific and agonist-induced expression of t-PA and PAI-1.The specific aims of the project are: A.to determine the relation between levels of t-PA and PAI-1 expression and pattern of DNA methylation at the t-PA and PAI-1 promoter and known enhancer regions.B.to determine the effect of HDAC inhibitors on t-PA promoter/enhancer reporter gene expression.C.to identify the role of distinct HDAC and HAT in regulating expression of t-PA and PAI-1.D.to determine the mechanisms by which activation of sirtuins (class III HDAC) induce an increased expression of t-PA, rather than the expected reduction in t-PA expression. E.to study the interaction between statins and HDAC inhibitors in t-PA and PAI-1 expression.F.to study the role of HDAC and HAT in the inflammation- mediated suppression of t-PA and induction of PAI-1 in ECThe results from this work will give us a better understanding of the epigenetic and non-epigenetic mechanisms regulating the fibrinolytic system of endothelial cells. They may provide clues as to approaches to selectively improve the pro-fibrinolytic, anti-thrombotic potential of the vascular system.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div.

SummaryTissue-type plasminogen activator plays an important role in the removal of intravascular fibrin deposits and has several physiological roles and pathological activities in the brain. Its expression by many other cell types suggests that t-PA has additional functions outside the vascular and central nervous system. In recent years the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in regulating gene expression has become increasingly evident. All cells of an organism have an identical genome, but expression of individual genes needs to be adapted to the requirements of each cell type and to be appropriate with respect to the environment. Epigenetic changes are a means to annotate the unchanged genome and form the interface between the cellular environment and the transcriptional needs. Epigenetic changes include DNA methylation, mainly of CpG dimers, and histone modifications, which change the chromatin such as to favor or repress gene expression. The degree of gene activity is the result of epigenetic modifications, the cell type specific presence of transcription factors that interact with the gene promoter or enhancer, and responses of the cell to signals from the outside, such as hormones, growth factors, cytokines or other agonists. In recent published and unpublished results, we delineated the role of cell-type specific epigenetic modifications of the t-PA gene. The aim of the project is to better understand the epigenetic mechanisms that regulate cell-type specific and agonist-induced expression of t-PA.The project can be divided in three subprojects.A) Comparative analysis of the transcription initiation sites used for t-PA gene expression.B) Effect of promoter DNA methylation on t-PA gene expression in endothelial cells (EC) and other cell types.C) Identification of putative enhancers in the first intron of the t-PA gene.The results from this work will give us a better understanding of the epigenetic and non-epigenetic mechanisms regulating of t-PA expression by endothelial cells and other cell types. This may provide clues as to means to selectively improve the pro-fibrinolytic, anti-thrombotic potential of t-PA in the vascular system, as well as in the brain or other physiological conditions where t-PA plays an important role.

Müller	University of Berne	Institut für Tierpathologie Vetsuisse-Fakultät Universität Bern	2011-04-01	2015-03-31	Governing the niche: The role of cell-cell adhesion in activation and lineage commitment of mouse and human hair follicle stem cells	IIn recent years our understanding of epidermal stem cell biology has advanced considerably, in particular with respect to location, marker expression, and capacity to differentiate into three main lineages (hair follicle, interfollicular epidermis, and sebaceous gland). In contrast, very little is known about the intricate web of signals responsible for maintaining the pool of these cells throughout our lives, and directing their differentiation down different lineages in response to the demands of growth, regeneration and wound healing. It is exactly these signals which are disrupted in many diseases, extending from age-related conditions through to cancer. Numerous signaling pathways characteristic of epidermal stem cells have recently been defined. However the mechanisms these cells use to sense their environment and change their behavior remain largely unexplored. Early findings from our group now indicate that cell-cell adhesion molecules control many important processes, including quiescence/proliferation, lineage commitment, and reprogramming.Adhesion molecules such as the cadherins are known to control growth factor receptors via outside-in signaling in several epithelial cell types. However elucidation of their exact signaling roles in knock-out models for adhesion molecules is complicated by the fact that these mice are often non-viable due to loss of cell-cell adhesion, or compromised by the ability of certain cadherins to compensate for each other. Using a specialized approach developed for investigations of the skin disease pemphigus vulgaris (PV), we are able to block the signaling function of the adhesion molecule desmoglein (Dsg) 3 with high specificity, without affecting its role in cell-cell adhesion. Using this approach we have found that disrupting Dsg3 function results in c-Myc accumulation and hyperproliferation (Williamson et al, EMBO, 25, 2006). We have also observed epidermal stem cell depletion and loss of marker expression in the bulge stem cell niche, and have obtained indirect evidence for alterations in EGFR and PI3K/AKT signaling (Schulze et al, unpublished). This powerful approach is based on the PV auto-antibody and a pathogenic anti-Dsg3 antibody, and is effective in both mouse and human. It now permits us to evaluate in detail the Dsg3-dependent signaling pathways and epigenetic controls in epidermal stem cell activation and lineage commitment in several wild type and transgenic mouse models, followed by validation of our findings in human tissue. This project will benefit greatly from a synergistic group of methods established either in our lab, or at our collaborators (EPFL, University of Fribourg, SNF Sinergia network). Methods will include clonogenic and hair re-growth transplantation assays, multicolor flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy, western blot analyses, quantitative real-time PCR, plus genome-wide methylation studies to define epigenetic alterations via chromatin immunoprecipitation and promoter arrays. Furthermore, transgenic mouse models will be used for permanent lineage tracing of multipotent stem cells, wound healing and regeneration assays. Human PV donors and tissues samples will be obtained from the EU pemphigus network and the University of Lübeck.This study will significantly increase our understanding of how signaling pathways and epigenetic changes downstream of disrupted Dsg3 function control epidermal stem cell activation and lineage commitment. This work will expand our understanding of both tissue homeostasis and wound healing, and with its focus on Myc and cellular reprogramming, will benefit research on cancer stem cells and stem cell therapeutics. Finally it will also advance our understanding of PV pathology, and lay the basis for novel therapeutic treatment approaches for PV patients.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div.

Analyses in various model organisms suggest that the evolutionarily conserved chromatin remodelling protein Mi-2 plays an important role in distinct aspects of germline and early embryonic development, particularly during developmental transitions. Although Mi-2 was first identified as an integral component of the canonical NuRD complex, it becomes now increasingly clear that Mi-2 has also NuRD independent functions. Mi-2 orthologues were shown to be involved in important developmental processes, such as homeostasis and lineage choice of haematopoietic stem cells in mouse, the transition of pluripotent cells from pre- to post-implantation of mouse embryos, embryonic patterning and germline development in D. melanogaster and germline-soma distinction in C. elegans. Moreover, the A. thaliana Mi-2 orthologue Pickle is required for repression of seed-associated genes in the transition from inert seeds to growing seedlings and for suppression of embryonic development in meristem cells to allow the transition to post-embryonic development. While much progress has been made in understanding chromatin-mediated control of gene activity in general, much less is still known about the specific developmental functions of Mi-2 and the molecular mechanisms that are associated with it.Working hypothesisDuring developmental transitions in C. elegans, important epigenetic reprogramming is taking place. Based on previous results we postulate that LET-418/Mi-2 is taking part of this reprogramming. For instance, we think that LET-418/Mi-2 is playing a role in shutting down the germline expression profile already during oogenesis to get the genome ready for somatic development. Another epigenetic reprogramming is taking place when the germline starts to develop. Our experiments are designed to better understand the role of let-418/Mi-2 in these processes and to identify additional players.Specific aimsTo better understand the developmental functions of the Mi-2 protein family, we will use C. elegans as a genetic model system to investigate the cellular and developmental functions of LET-418/Mi-2. First, we will analyze the role of LET-418/Mi-2 for germline development, particularly during the proliferation phase and during oogenesis and oocyte maturation. Particularly, we are interested in knowing whether let-418/Mi-2 has a role in stem cell division in the distal region of the gonad, and whether it is involved in the chromatin transitions during oogenesis and in Z2/Z3 during embryogenesis. Genetic screens will allow uncovering new players in the regulation of germline chromatin, and microarray expression profiling of let-418/Mi-2 animals should provide crucial information about the functions of let-418/Mi-2 in regulating germline-specific genes. We will also perform a phenotypic analysis of the germline of let-418/Mi-2 males and investigate the antagonistic functions of let-418 and mes-4. Finally, we propose to perform genome-wide RNAi screens to identify additional developmental functions of let-418/Mi-2 and its paralogue chd-3/Mi-2.Expected value of the proposed projectSince Mi-2 is conserved among eukaryotes, characterizing the role of C. elegans LET-418/Mi-2 in the remodelling of germline and somatic chromatin should contribute to the general understanding of epigenetic programming. For instance, the precise resetting of epigenetic modifications during gametogenesis is crucial to sustain fertilization and further development in all organisms. Hence, the implication for human health and reproduction are profound.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div. I-III)	415000.0	CHF

BackgroundDrugs and bile acids enter the hepatocyte by carrier-mediated transport across the basolateral (sinusoidal) membrane. The organic anion transport proteins OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OAT7 show predominant expression in hepatocytes. OATP1A2 is expressed in cholangiocytes and at the apical membrane of intestinal epithelial cells, where it mediates the absorption of drugs such as fexofenadine and aliskiren. OSTa-OSTß is a heteromeric transporter, expressed in liver, intestine and kidney, that mediates the efflux of organic anions back into blood. Changes and interindividual differences in transporter expression are likely to have a major impact on the pharmacokinetics of substrate drugs and may also affect the susceptibility of the liver towards drug-induced toxicity.1.2. Working Hypotheses• Vitamin D3 treatment increases expression of OATP1A2 and PCFT in human intestine• Vitamin D3 treatment not only has an effect on gene transcription through activation of the vitamin D receptor, but also on microRNA expression and DNA methylation in human intestine• The heterodimeric transporter OSTa-OSTß is regulated extensively at the level of gene transcription, as well as by as yet uncharacterized mechanisms during mild renal dysfunction• The organic anion transporter 7 is the major uptake carrier for butyrate in hepatocytes and its expression level is suppressed by bile acids through an effect on gene transcription• Hepatic drug and bile acid transporters in hepatocytes are regulated by epigenetic mechanisms including miRNA expression and DNA methylation patterns in liver tissue• Drug-induced liver injury may become detectable at an early stage for defined drugs by measuring specific biomarkers in blood1.3. Specific Aims• To correlate expression levels of OATP1A2 and PCFT in duodenal biopsies from volunteers treated with vit. D3 with fexofenadine pharmacokinetics and plasma folate levels• To assess the effects of vit. D3 treatment on the microRNA profile and on gene-specific and genome-wide (global) DNA methylation in intestinal biopsies• To investigate the mechanism of hepatic Osta-Ostß induction in uninephrectomized mice• To further characterize the transcriptional regulation of the human OSTa-OSTß genes• To assess the relative importance of OAT7 as a butyrate uptake carrier in human hepatocytes and to characterize the mechanism by which OAT7 expression is suppressed by bile acids• To correlate the expression profile of hepatic drug and bile acid transporters in a human liver bank with DNA methylation and with the miRNA expression profile• To investigate whether patients with flucloxacillin-induced liver injury exhibit a specific miRNA profile and DNA methylation pattern in blood that could be used for early diagnosis 1.4. Methods• Measurement of transporter expression in human liver and intestinal tissue by western blot analysis and quantitative real-time PCR• miRNA and DNA methylation profiling using human miRNA microarrays and the MeDIP-CGI-Array; confirmation of differential methylation of CpG regions by bisulfite PCR-based RFLP analysis (COBRA)• Transcriptional regulation: promoter analysis, deletional constructs, reporter gene assays in transfected cells, specific gene knockdowns using siRNA technology, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and site-directed mutagenesis• Transport assays in cultured cells and in polarized cells grown on Transwell filters• Pharmacokinetic studies in human volunteers according to especially designed protocols1.5. Expected Value of the Proposed ProjectNew insights into the mechanisms by which vitamin D3 regulates drug uptake carriers in human intestine by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms will be obtained. The mechanisms that govern expression of OSTa-OSTß will be better understood. The suppressive effect of bile acids on expression of OAT/OCT transporters such as OAT7 could have a major impact on the hepatic uptake of substrate drugs in conditions associated with elevated intracellular bile acid levels, e.g. drug-induced inhibition of the bile salt export pump, BSEP. As yet unidentified metabolic changes incurred during mild renal dysfunction that lead to cross-signaling between the kidney and liver with measurable changes in serum biomarkers (serum bile acid levels) will be investigated. The epigenetic regulation of hepatocellular drug and bile acid transporters could have major implications for drug disposition in health and in liver disease, particularly since unexplained rises in serum bilirubin, bile acids and transaminases (ALT) are becoming an increasing problem during drug development. Finally, new blood-based biomarkers for the early, sensitive and specific diagnosis of drug-related liver dysfunction caused by drugs such as flucloxacillin could be identified in the Swiss Drug-Induced Liver Injury Cohort.

The most commonly used microparticles are sub-micron sized (0.1-1 µm diameter), inorganic compounds of titanium dioxide (TiO2, E171) aluminum silicate (AlSi, Kaolin, E559), silicon dioxide (SiO2, E551) and iron oxide (E172).The total daily intake of TiO2 in the Western world is estimated to be up to 76 mg. To date, no restrictions for the use of TiO2 and AlSi in dietary products are enforced by food safety authorities. Indicators that TiO2 may have hazardous potential were found in animal and in vitro studies. In intestinal biopsies, aggregates of titanium were detected in M-cells of Peyer’s patches and in underlying macrophages. Crohn's diseased (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) which represent a chronic, relapsing inflammation of the intestine characterized by an altered pro-inflammatory cytokine pattern, defective mucosal barrier and increased intestinal permeability, the so-called “leaky gut”. Both environmental and genetic factors are associated with an increased risk to develop IBD. Rising incidences of CD in industrialized countries are attributed to Western nutrition. Whereas many (>190) genetic risk factors for IBD are known, insight into environmental factors is scarce.Together with two other proteins (ASC and caspase-1) NLRP3 forms the inflammasome, an intracellular signalling platform that is activated upon a number of stimuli, such as peptidoglycans, ATP, asbestos, silica, and uric acid crystals. Nonbacterial inflammasome activators such as ATP and small inorganic substances are summarized as “danger signals” or danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). TiO2 was found to be another inorganic compound that may activate the inflammasome. Since the intestinal epithelium forms the first barrier against food derived TiO2, we investigated whether TiO2 is also recognized as “danger signal” by human IEC. During our recent SNF project of the role of dietary TiO2 particles we could show that TiO2 in concentrations taken up by humans aggravate experimental colitis in mice. TiO2 aggregates can be found in the spleen of these aninals. In addition, in patients with active UC we found significantly increased TiO2 serum levels as copared to patients in remission of the disaese and healthy controls indicating that mainly during active colitis TiO2 may play a disease modifiying role. In a collaboration with colleagues from Lille we coud show that aluminum similarly is able to aggravate experimental colitis. During active colonic inflammation many CD and UC patients also experience extraintestinal manifestations (EIM). So far ist the pathophysiology of EIM is completely unclear. Based on our recent findings we aim to further analyze whether 1) The amount of penetrations of dietary micro/nano-particles (titanium dioxide) in patients with active IBD depends on the extent of involved (inflamed) mucosa.2) Dietary micro/nano-particles (TiO2) are able to penetrate the mucosal barrier and may accumulate in extraintestinal tissues leading to extraintestinal manifestations of IBD 3) Dietary micro/nano-particles (titanium dioxide) may cause indirect impact on mucosal inflammation via microbiota changes and epigenetic alterations in mucosal cells 4) Physical properties of dietary micro/nano-particles allow penetration into the mucosa which are not specific for and restricted to TiO2.5) Modulation of PTPN22 activity will impact the TiO2 effect The long term goal will be a better understanding of environmental factors that contribute to chronic intestinal inflammation and a chance to modify the disease course by diets avoiding these factors.

1309	Henry Markram	EPF Lausanne	EPFL SV BMI LNC	2010-04-01	2013-08-31	Behavioral , molecular and neural consequences of environmental surprise in the VPA rat model of autism	In 1943 Leo Kanner famously described autism as “... an innate inability to form the usual, biologically provided affective contact with other people” [1]. Today, Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are defined as neurodevelopmental disorders, characterized by impaired social interactions, communication deficits and stereotypic, restricted, repetitive behavior [2]. For most current theories, autism is associated with loss of essential cognitive functions, together with hypo-functioning of the amygdala, the frontal lobes and the pre-frontal lobes. However, in the late 1990s, a new animal model suggested an alternative view. Experiments showed that pregnant rats injected with Valproic Acid (VPA) produced offspring whose behaviors mimic known autistic behaviors. Since then, Markram and collaborators have shown that brain slices from these rats display hyper-reactivity, caused by abnormally high short-range connectivity in the neocortex and a loss of inhibition in the amygdala, and hyper-plasticity, caused by over expression of NMDA receptors [117,121,122,123,124]. On the basis of these results, the authors have proposed the “Intense World Theory” of autism [24]. According to this theory, autism is caused by a pre-natal toxic insult that changes the trajectory of brain development in genetically pre-disposed individuals, favoring hyper-reactivity and hyper-plasticity in local brain circuits in the amygdala, the neocortex, and perhaps in other regions. The result is an “intense world syndrome” in which the autistic individual becomes extremely sensitive to environmental stimuli, developing idiosyncratic aversive reactions. In this setting, the deficits in social interaction, inability to communicate and the repetitive behaviors typical of autism should be interpreted not as cognitive deficits but as strategies providing the autistic child with a refuge against environmental surprises. Once acquired, the behaviors associated with these strategies will be difficult or impossible to reverse. It is plausible therefore, that frequent “environmental surprises” during critical periods of development could contribute to the progression of autism and that lowering the frequency of such unexpected environmental events could reduce or eliminate typical autistic behavior. The main objective of this proposal is thus to test these predictions in a VPA rat model of autism. More specifically the study will test three hypotheses: (i) frequent post-natal exposure to “environmental surprises” during early development will contribute to the progression of autistic symptoms in VPA-treated rats; (ii) reducing the frequency of environmental “surprises” will attenuate or prevent the emergence of autistic traits (iii) reducing the frequency of surprises will attenuate or prevent the development of hyper-reactive, hyper-plastic microcircuits in amygdala and neo-cortex. The specific goals of the study will thus be to (i) compare the behavior of VPA-treated and control rats raised in environments characterized by a high and a low frequency of “environmental surprise; (ii) measure differences in gene expression between VPA-treated and control rats, raised in these environments; (iii) measure differences in microcircuit reactivity and plasticity in brain slices from these rats; (iv) measure differences in neural activation when behaving rats are exposed to a stressful social stimulus (exposure to a “stranger rat”). To this end, the study will compare 270 male Wistar rats from VPA-treated dams, against a control population of 270 untreated animals. Pups will be weaned at 21 days, randomly assigned to 1 of 3 environments (a standard laboratory cage used as a reference environment, a “low surprise” environment, and a “high surprise” environment) and allowed to develop for 4 months. Each population will then be split into 4 randomly chosen sub-populations, to be used respectively for behavioral testing, molecular testing, in vitro and in vivo measurements.The proposed study suggests new strategies for exploring the genetic, epigenetic, and neural changes associated with autism and will provide valuable insights as to whether early life exposure to “environmental surprises” is beneficial or harmful to brain development. If “surprising environments” are found to be beneficial, the study will support the mainstream view that environmental enrichment is important in rehabilitation programs. By contrast, a finding that such environments are harmful would suggest a need for caution, pointing towards treatment strategies that attenuate exposure to unexpected events during early development.

1310	Ian Sanders	University of Lausanne	Département d'Ecologie et d'Evolution Faculté de Biologie et de Médecine Université de Lausanne	2012-10-01	2015-09-30	Evolutionary genomics of the mycorrhizal symbiosis	Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are important symbionts of plants. My group has taken a population and evolutionary genetics approach to study the genetic diversity of these fungi and its consequence for the symbiosis. We have shown in our previous work that by manipulating the natural genetic variation of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, using purely natural processes that occur in the fungi, we can considerably alter plant growth. Novel AMF lines, after crossing and segregation, can result in large growth increases in the plants or large decreases in growth. Because our manipulation of AMF involves crossing the fungi and then allowing genetic material to segregate in the offspring, it should be possible to “breed” AMF lines with greater effects on plant growth and efficiency in phosphate acquisition. However, at present we have no way of predicting which lines will be the most effective symbionts based on their genetic composition. In particular, we need to know which alleles in the fungus are associated with given quantitative plant traits. This is not a trivial exercise as the fungi do not display normal Mendelian inheritance and changes in plant growth are associated with quantitative changes in the presence of given alleles not only qualitative changes. This project will allow us to develop a very large set of genetic markers and at the same time contribute to filling unassembled gaps in the AMF genome. We will then generate crossed and segregated lines of the fungus and using the markers we will associate their genetic composition with quantitative plant growth traits. We will also use some very new DNA sequencing technology that allows the detection of sites in the DNA that have modifications such as methylation. This will allow us to develop a set of markers that potentially could result in epigenetic effects in the fungus that have consequences for the growth of plants in symbiosis. We will carry out an analysis to see if the presence of some of these “potentially epigenetic” markers in the fungus influence plant growth. If successful, this completely novel approach could be applied to many different organisms and questions in biology and medicine. AMF lines generated on this project and characterised genetically and in terms of their effects on plant growth will be used on an other Swiss NSF project to assess their beneficial effects on growth of cassava; a globally important food plant.

1311	Jean-Michel Aubry	University of Geneva	Service des Spécialités Psychiatriques Département de Santé Mentale et Psychiatrie Hôpitaux Universitaires de Genève	2014-11-01	2018-10-31	Investigating functional neural circuit vulnerability and biomarkers in high-risk offspring and normothymic bipolar disorder patients	BackgroundBipolar disorder (BD) usually starts during late adolescence or young adulthood and is a chronic disease with high morbidity, affecting about 2% of the population worldwide. It is well established that offspring of bipolar patients have an increased risk to develop mood and anxiety disorders but the neural basis of this vulnerability is still largely unknown. A growing body of preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that the addition of severe early life stress (ELS) on genetic risk can sensitize neural circuits regulating the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This process could then result in altered cortisol levels as well as long lasting functional changes in brain circuits. In BD, alteration of neural pathways implicated in emotional reactivity has been reported. Finally, data from studies with high-risk offspring suggest that subtle immune and neuroendocrine alterations may precede the onset of mood disorder episodes and may thus represent biomarkers of vulnerability.Goal and working hypothesisOur goal is to identify markers of vulnerability in asymptomatic individuals with familial risks of BD, relative to the general healthy population, and to compare these markers with findings in normothymic BD patients. This will be achieved using a combination of clinical, cerebral, and biological measures obtained in the same subjects. BD vulnerability will be investigated by probing the functional reactivity of brain networks using fMRI and EEG during both cognitive and affective regulation tasks. In addition HPA axis reactivity, immune mediators and epigenetic modifications in stress-related genes will be assessed. MethodsOur measures of vulnerability to BD will consist of 4 complementary approaches. First we aim to probe the dynamics of fronto-limbic circuits with fMRI in two conditions: during recovery from a social laboratory stressor, and during performance of a self-focus task. For this purpose, we have adapted the Montreal Imaging Stress task (Dedovic et al., 2005) and have designed a novel task requiring stressful calculations interwoven with resting state periods. We also designed a task requiring repeated switches from an internal self-based focus to an external stimulus-based focus. Second, to further investigate the role of cognitive control on emotional processing, we propose to use high-density EEG (256-channel) and advanced source analysis technique to study the functional connectivity within a network including prefrontal, frontopolar areas, and limbic-related structures. A n-back memory task including a socio-emotional component (gaze) will be used to probe this circuit. Third, to determine whether altered stress-induced network activity is linked to epigenetic methylation changes in stress-related genes and HPA axis dysregulation, we aim to investigate allele-specific epigenetic modifications in selected stress-related and bipolar risk genes. In addition we aim to assess HPA reactivity following the adapted MIST social stressor performed during fMRI imaging session. Finally, cytokines and immune mediators will be assessed at basal levels in normothymic BD, high-risk offspring and controls. These neuroendocrine, immune and epigenetic modifications will be linked to a detailed analysis of early-life adversity in high-risk offspring and normothymic BD.One group of offspring of bipolar patients (15-30 years old) and one group of normothymic bipolar patients (15-55 years old), as well as their matched control groups will be recruited. All the investigations will be achieved during 3 different sessions.Expected value of the proposed projectThis project will help to define cognitive and biological correlates of BD and should help to better understand neural circuits and cognitive vulnerability factors. It will also open new perspectives with the use of such markers to predict clinical outcome for asymptomatic subjects at high genetic risk.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div.

When detected at an early stage, the majority of cancers can be cured with current treatment modalities. However, most cancers present at an advanced stage. The discovery of sensitive and specific biomarkers may improve preclinical diagnosis of primary or recurrent colorectal cancer, and holds the promise of prognostic and could be important for therapeutic management. Epigenetic alterations that initiate and drive tumorigenesis are promising targets because they may precede clinically obvious cancers, can be detected at sensitive levels, may be specific to tumor cells, and can potentially provide information about prognosis and treatment. It is now evident that aberrant DNA methylation observed in cancer cells is not restricted to a few CpG islands, but affects multiple loci. Determination of the methylation patterns of multiple genes (epigenetic profiling) to obtain complex DNA methylation signatures appears promising in order to better understanding colorectal cancer biology and to identify new molecular markers in a way to improve treatment and prevention strategies.A key challenge in clinical oncology is the identification of sensitive and specific biomarkers for early detection of cancer. For early and non-invasive detection of cancer, the analysis of nucleic acid markers in the blood of patients should provide useful tools for diagnostic developments. Many authors have suggested the possible utility of the analysis of cell-free tumor-derived nucleic acids in plasma. Analyzing methylation of DNA purified from plasma offers several advantages compared to other potential biomarkers. DNA methylation, which is a covalent modification of cytosines, is chemically stable and thus, contrary to markers like circulating proteins or RNAs, its analysis is less sensitive to the storage conditions of biological samples. Reactivation of telomerase is a necessary event for the sustained growth of most human tumors. Our previous studies showed that reactivation of telomerase may occur through hypermethylation of the hTERT promoter in the quasi totality of colorectal tumors. Therefore, epigenetic change of the hTERT promoter could become a powerful biomarker for early diagnosis of colorectal cancers. The aims of this study are to better define the methylation profile of colorectal cancers and determine whether methylation of some promoter genes, e.g. hTERT, could become biomarkers for early diagnosis and follow-up of patients with a colorectal cancer. In a way to answer the intended aims of our project, 4 interdependent researches will be carried out during this study: 1) to identify new potential epigenetic biomarkers in colorectal cancers. Differential DNA methylation patterns in colon cancer versus normal colon will be investigated using Affymetrix Promoter Tilling Arrays and new approaches for enrichment of methylated DNA 2) to analyze evolution of methylation profiling during colorectal carcinogenesis. A newly developed promoter methylation macroarray, named methylation ligation-dependent macroarray (MLM), will be used. This macroarray will be built with some of the candidate genes identified in the methylation array. 3) to define the potential of hTERT methylation to become a powerful biomarker for early colorectal cancer diagnosis using plasma DNA. 4) to define the potential of some of the newly identify methylated promoter genes to become epigenetic biomarkers for early diagnosis and follow-up of colorectal cancer patients.

For instance, inflammatory signaling pathways activated by over-nutrition directly inhibit insulin action in patients with type 2 diabetes. The cell-intrinsic metabolic repertoire of immune cells dictates their function. Nutrient channels, activity of metabolic pathways, metabolic checkpoint kinases, and the regulation and epigenetic architecture of genes involved in metabolism together define the immune-metabolic repertoire. Its remodeling in activated immune cells sustains increased cellular bioenergetic, as well as non-bioenergetic, requirements. Here, my host laboratory and myself propose to test the hypothesis that an “obesity-diabetes milieu” affects and imprints T cell functions in a time-graded manner. We will comprehensively define how chronic nutritional stress impacts (i) the metabolic repertoire, (ii) function, and (iii) the epigenetic landscape of T cells.

Still, transcription elongation and alternative splicing regulation are poorly understood, and the former has revealed unexpected level of complexity in yeast, strongly encouraging better characterization of those processes in humans.We therefore developed a method in human cells, that enables (i) high-resolution monitoring of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) density genome-wide, (ii) the detection of co-transcriptional splicing events, through the nascent transcript sequence characterization, and (iii) the assessment of the connection between transcription elongation and splicing.We strongly feel that this innovative method will help decipher the origins of Pol II pausing, as assessed through the connections with other well-characterized genetic and epigenetic marks. Additionally, it offers the first combined high-resolution monitoring of both transcription elongation and co-transcriptional splicing processes. We expect to decipher the implications of Pol II pausing or transcription elongation rate on alternative splicing occurrence. Those analyses will greatly increase our understanding of gene expression regulation.This project has significant clinical potential, as the comparison of specific transcription elongation/splicing profiles in healthy and diseased conditions will help identify new therapeutic targets.

Collectively, these 'abiotic stresses' restrict plant vigour and create a 'yield gap' between the actual crop productivity and the theoretical maximum productivity of the crop. Why does the yield gap occur? Plants only grow well in certain ranges of environmental conditions, and they stop growing, for example at low or high temperatures, and so yield is reduced. Plant growth is intimately related to meristem cell division rates. Unlike animals, plants grow continuously and growth requires new cells to provide the building blocks. When plants perceive stress, specific signals block cell division. Under extreme conditions, this is beneficial, but current evidence suggests that plants shut down cell division early as a precaution in response to stress. Therefore they stop growing, even though conditions are not severe. How does abiotic stress stop cell division? An important factor is the cell's ability to regulate its capacity for reduction and oxidation (redox), and to protect itself from uncontrolled oxidation. The cells reducing power is stored as pools of reductant and anti-oxidant compounds. One of the most important cellular antioxidants is the tripeptide called glutathione, which can prevent oxidation to molecules such as proteins and alter their activities and functions by binding to them in a reversible manner. When the total glutathione pool of the cell is low or the ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to glutathione disulphide (GSSG) is low, cell division is blocked at a point in the cell cycle called G1, a point where the cells are deciding whether to divide. Plant cells measure GSH and GSSG in order to assess the ability to buffer redox changes and the external environment. Foundation studies in the host lab have shown that GSH moves from the cytoplasm into the nucleus early in the plant cell cycle and stays associated with chromatin throughout mitosis. This finding suggests that redox controls involving GSH operate to regulate the cell cycle in plants, as well as in animals. The aim of this project is to determine how GSH recruitment into the nucleus during the cell cycle alters histone and DNA methylation to influence stress tolerance.

It is assumed that a third of all congenital birth defects are due to failures in neural crest development, illustrating the significance of this stem cell population. Moreover, it has recently been shown that an embryonic NCSC gene expression signature is re-activated upon tumor initiation in a zebrafish model of melanoma, suggesting a functional involvement of a NCSC program in tumors originating from neural crest derivatives. Thus, it is important to understand the mechanisms regulating NCSC biology. Our laboratory has a long-standing interest in NCSC research, which led to the identification of several signalling pathways, transcription factors, and epigenetic mechanisms regulating NCSC self-renewal, multipotency, and cell fate decisions. In addition, comparison with central nervous system (CNS) development revealed similarities and differences in how distinct types of neural stem cells (PNS vs CNS) are regulated. In the following SNF funding period, we plan to extend our study on mechanisms controlling NCSCs; furthermore, we aim to assess the functional association of an embryonic NCSC program with processes involved in melanoma formation and progression. In particular, we aim• to complete the functional analysis of the transcription factor YY1 in NCSCs. In the previous funding period, we used global gene expression analysis and bioinformatical tools to identify transcription factors specifically active in NCSCs as opposed to neural crest (NC) derivatives. Among these factors was YY1, which -according to our ongoing studies- is required for NC development and melanoma formation. Here we seek to examine the molecular mechanisms underlying YY1 function in NCSCs.• to determine the function of the stem cell factor Sall4 in NCSCs and melanoma in vivo. Sall4 represents another factor identified in our screen. Sall4 controls pluripotency in ESCs, but neither its role in NC development nor in melanoma formation is known. Therefore, we will perform inducible and conditional knock-out studies in mouse models of NC development and melanoma, respectively. Moreover, we aim to identify targets of Sall4 that mediate its function in development and disease.• to continue our identification of novel regulatory cues controlling ‘stemness’ in NCSCs and, possibly, melanoma. Based on our screen for genes specifically expressed and/or active in NCSCs, we have evidence for several other transcription factors and regulatory molecules being possibly involved in NCSC regulation. To study the implication of these factors in NC development, we plan to establish an in vitro system amenable to medium/high-throughput functional screening assays. The function of selected candidate factors in NCSCs and, if time allows, melanoma will then be further studied in established in vivo systems.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div.

This led to independent research programs with little interactions between them. However, increasing evidence suggests that key features of the metabolic syndrome are due to a pathologic activation of the immune system. This holds true e.g. for impaired insulin secretion and action in patients with type 2 diabetes. Strikingly, some features of the metabolic syndrome persist after loss of body weight and are even transmitted vertically, pointing to a genetic or epigenetic basis.Beyond these chronic pathological aspects, the immune system may also play a role in the physiologic regulation of metabolism. In support of this notion, we observed in preliminary studies that insulin stimulates IL-1ß production selectively in M1 polarized macrophages via glucose uptake and the NLRP3 inflammasome. In this same setting an increased uptake of glucose in lymphocytes was also observed.The metabolic repertoire of immune cells dictates their function. Nutrient channels, activity of metabolic pathways, metabolic checkpoint kinases, and the regulation and epigenetic architecture of genes involved in metabolism together define the immune-metabolic repertoire. Its remodeling in activated immune cells sustains increased cellular bioenergetic requirements. Beyond ATP, however, we, and others, recently identified important non-bioenergetic functions of metabolic adjustment in immune cells, operative e.g. via epigenetic and post-transcriptional mechanisms.Here we propose to link metabolism (Marc Y Donath), immunology (Christoph Hess) and epigenetics (Renato Paro) to test the hypothesis that an 'obesity-diabetes milieu' affects and imprints macrophage- and T cell-functions in a time-graded manner. We will comprehensively define how acute vs. chronic nutritional stress impacts (i) the metabolic repertoire, (ii) function and (iii) the epigenetic landscape of innate and adaptive immune cells; and assess mechanisms of reversibility of epigenetic marks imprinted by over-nutrition.

Tschan	University of Berne	Institut für Pathologie Medizinische Fakultät Universität Bern	2017-05-01	2021-04-30	Identification and analysis of PU.1 cell death pathways to improve leukemia therapy	The ETS-transcription factor PU.1 is needed throughout hematopoietic differentiation particularly by orchestrating terminal differentiation of macrophages, neutrophils, B-cells and Th9 cells. The role of PU.1 in myeloid differentiation and its regulation have been thoroughly investigated and many genes directly involved in myeloid development and function are transcriptional targets of PU.1. Importantly, low but not absent PU.1 expression can lead to the transformation of myeloid progenitor cells to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Thus, PU.1 is regarded as a tumor suppressor in AML, a disease that is characterized by an accumulation of immature blast cells with increased cell survival. Much less information is available on PU.1’s function in cell death or cell cycle regulation. Comprehensive functional studies analyzing the role of PU.1 during cell death responses of AML cells to cancer therapies are missing. Our preliminary data describe a new tumor suppressor function for PU.1 by supporting TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis in AML cells. Our data indicate that PU.1 represses the NF-?B survival pathway, and thus the induction of anti-apoptotic genes such as cFLIP, Bcl-2 or Mcl-1. Furthermore, blocking PU.1 expression causes a shift in cFLIP expression towards the anti-apoptotic splice variant cFLIPshort. Altogether, these results indicate a new facet of PU.1's tumor suppressor function during anti-leukemic therapy and low PU.1 levels may contribute to resistance towards TRAIL treatment. Moreover, inhibiting PU.1 also attenuates AML cell toxicity caused by anthracycline-based therapies. In my opinion, further studies to decipher mechanisms how PU.1 affects cell death and how PU.1 protein stability is regulated during cancer therapy warrants further investigations. Findings from this project hold potential for improved therapeutic strategies in mainly AML treatment and a better understanding of how PU.1 keeps neoplastic transformations in check. I propose to investigate in more detail how PU.1 regulates responses to cytotoxic particularly death receptor mediated therapies I suggest to address the following objectives: I. PU.1 mechanisms in response to cytotoxic therapy. I propose, (a) to validate our 2D cell culture findings in 3D in vitro and in vivo, (b) to further characterize PU.1’s cell death function in regard of TRAIL receptor regulation, (c) to validate possible apoptotic functions of PU.1 in additional hematopoietic neoplasms, (d) to investigate PU.1’s role in epigenetic regulation of cell death-associated genes. II. I propose, (a) to initially investigate if blocking major cellular degradation processes (e.g. caspases, necroptosis, proteasome, autophagy) affect PU.1 protein expression, and (b) to characterize the PU.1 protein interactome during cytotoxic treatment and to inhibit/activate newly identified proteins involved in PU.1 protein stability for novel therapeutic options in cytotoxic therapies.III. PU.1 and alternative splicing of cFLIP. I propose, (a) to analyze the function of cFLIP in resistance towards TRAIL treatment and chemotherapy, (b) to test if PU.1 associates with the cFLIP promoter region to promote specific use of splice sites, and (c) to investigate if PU.1 transcriptionally regulates posttranslational modifiers of cFLIP.The proposed studies will help to unravel novel functions of PU.1 in cell death responses to cancer therapies and may further elucidate its role in suppressing leukemia by targeting anti-apoptotic proteins. Identifying factors that regulate PU.1 protein stability may provide novel targets to be used in combination with current cytotoxic therapies.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div.

SUMMARYResearch in our laboratory focuses on two main objectives: 1. We combine the genetic and molecular approaches uniquely available in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to address fundamental questions about the mechanisms by which eukaryotic activator proteins control gene expression. Recently, we initiated a new project concerning the dynamic exchange of histones within chromatin and its role in transcription regulation and associated epigenetic modifications. The basic building block of chromatin is the nucleosome, which consists of DNA wrapped around an octamer of the four histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. We found that while histones H2A and H2B are continuously exchanging genome-wide outside of S phase, histones H3 and H4 only exchange in the promoter regions of active loci. Furthermore, we obtained evidence that an active mechanism prevents histones H3 and H4 from exchanging throughout the body of transcribed genes. These findings raise fundamental questions about the role of these events in regulated gene transcription and associated epigenetic events. Firstly, is the exchange of histones at promoters a cause or a consequence of transcription? Secondly, are some of the histone post-translational modifications typically seen at active promoters required for, or are they a result of, histones exchanging within these regions? Thirdly, what role do the histone chaperones that have been implicated in diverse nucleosome transactions play in this process? The experiments outlined in Part I of the present proposal are meant to provide some answers to these questions.2. We aim at understanding the role of the hepatitis B virus-encoded HBx protein and its interaction with host cell proteins during infection and in the pathogenesis of liver cancer. Chronic infection by hepatitis B virus (HBV) affects more than 350 million people worldwide and is leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma, one of the most common human cancers. HBV encodes a small regulatory protein, known as HBx, which is essential for viral infection and has been implicated in HBV-mediated liver oncogenesis. The basis for HBx function in either process remains elusive and is the focus of our studies. We obtained structural, biochemical and genetic evidence that HBx stimulates HBV gene expression and causes chromosomal instability in cultured cells by binding to host cell protein DDB1, an essential subunit of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex implicated in the regulation of diverse cellular functions. Our current results are consistent with HBx exerting its activities by subverting the normal function of the DDB1 E3 ligase complex to target cellular proteins for ubiquitination and, perhaps, subsequent degradation. We now aim to identify the cellular substrate(s) of HBx and further explore the molecular mechanism whereby HBx stimulates HBV gene expression through its association with the E3 ligase. We also wish to investigate the relevance of HBx binding to DDB1 under experimental conditions closer to natural HBV infection. Given the likely fundamental importance of the interaction of HBx and the DDB1 E3 ligase for natural HBV infection and associated liver cancer, this virus-host protein interaction may represent a promising new target for therapeutic intervention.

However, resistance to these drugs develops in some children, leading to treatment failure. In general, glucocorticoid resistance in childhood ALL is indicative of poor treatment outcome. The mechanisms by which ALL cells develop resistance to glucocorticoids are not well defined. We are making significant advances in our understanding of glucocorticoid resistance through studies utilising our unique experimental model of ALL. This is a living model of leukaemia developed in the laboratory, which closely mimics the disease in children. So far we have been successful in identifying a number of previously undiscovered ways in which leukaemia cells develop glucocorticoid resistance.Overall GoalsThe goals of this project are to: (1) determine global epigenetic changes associated with glucocorticoid resistance in high-risk paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patients who respond poorly to therapy; (2) develop targeted therapies to reverse glucocorticoid resistance; (3) use a clinically relevant xenograft model of paediatric ALL and examine in vivo efficacy as a proof of principle.Hypotheses (1) Epigenetic mechanisms affect glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding to discrete genomic regions and thereby influence glucocorticoid-induced gene expression; (2) An integrated genome-wide approach will lead to novel insights into glucocorticoid resistance and its reversal in paediatric ALL; (3) A cell-based high-throughput screen (HTS) using ex vivo cultures of paediatric ALL xenograft cells will define a novel class of glucocorticoid resistance-reversing drugs.Research PlanSpecific Aim 1: Identify epigenetic mechanisms of glucocorticoid resistance in paediatric ALL xenografts using an integrated genome-wide approach. Building on the group’s published and preliminary results we plan to interrogate glucocorticoid resistance in BCP-ALL xenografts derived from direct leukaemia explants of poor prednisolone responders (PPR) and prednisolone good responders (PGR) patients using ChIP-seq, ChIP-chip and ChIP-qPCR methodology, which will complement the ongoing gene expression analysis. Specific Aim 2:Identify and test candidate pathways for reversal of glucocorticoid resistance. In this Aim we will utilise the hypotheses generated in Aim 1 to identify pathways by which glucocorticoid sensitivity can be modulated. We will then design resistance reversal strategies that will be tested in ALL cell lines and xenografts. CMap and GSEA analysis of gene expression data will be used to identify pathways by which dexamethasone resistance can be reversed. In addition, the motif analysis in Aim 1 will identify candidate proteins for siRNA knockdown, or inhibition if specific drugs are available. Specific Aim 3:Carry out a high throughput screen (HTS) to develop a new class of glucocorticoid resistance-reversing drugs. A limitation of previous efforts to reverse glucocorticoid resistance in lymphoid malignancies is that the candidate drugs were not specifically selected for that purpose using a relevant cell-based screen. In this Specific Aim we will carry out a cell-based HTS using ex vivo-cultured xenograft cells.Outcomes and significanceThe outcomes from this work will be to: (1) define the “epigenetic landscape” in a clinically relevant model of glucocorticoid resistance; (2) identify and test novel strategies to reverse glucocorticoid resistance; and (3) identify new compounds that reverse glucocorticoid resistance in paediatric ALL for preclinical development. The significance of the work is that it will lead to improved outcomes for patients with relapsed/refractory lymphoid malignancies.

Davidson, will be on the emerging subfield of “integrative data analysis” for genomic data in the Statistical Genomics group of Prof. Dr. M. Robinson at the Institute of Molecular Life Sciences (University of Zurich; Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics). We aim to build a genome-wide predictive model for alternative splicing based on epigenetic state. Variations in alternative splicing are known to be associated with disease, including cancer. Hence, we plan to study the correlation between alternative-splicing and epigenetic markers in a colorectal cancer tissue series. We will supplement and validate the methods and tools we develop using the rich datasets from the ENCODE and Epigenome Roadmap projects. Opportunities for innovation in the development of informatics strategies are large and we are well-placed to not only develop methods, but make publicly available software tools for the wider genomic community.
