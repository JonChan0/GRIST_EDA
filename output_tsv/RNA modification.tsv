The role of the RNA silencing machinery in RNA-mediated transcriptional repression of repeated sequence DNA and transposons is beginning to be understood but its importance for regulation of single copy endogenous genes has yet to be explored. For a number of years, we have been analysing the different pathways that control expression of FLC, a floral repressor that regulates the key developmental switch to flowering in Arabidopsis. We have recently found that FLC is mis-regulated in mutants defective in RNA silencing. We will determine which RNA silencing components regulate FLC in different tissues and at different stages of development and undertake a genetic analysis to investigate if the RNA silencing activities are integrated with other pathways regulating FLC, focusing on the autonomous promotion pathway. We have detected small RNAs homologous to the 5' and 3' regions of FLC and antisense transcripts differing in abundance in different tissues have been found in whole genome array analyses. We will characterize these small RNAs and antisense transcripts further and investigate their production in different RNA silencing and autonomous pathway mutants. We will also investigate whether the RNA silencing machinery functions downstream of two of the components of the autonomous promotion pathway FCA and FY, identify other components required for their repression of FLC and investigate the role of FCA and FY and the RNA silencing components in FLC chromatin regulation. This will test the model that FCA/FY through changes in the processing of FLC nascent transcript, initiate a series of events involving small RNA production, RNA-guided recruitment of chromatin complexes, modification of the histones at FLC and transcriptional repression.

1	Mark Dickman	University of Sheffield	None	None	None	Exploring the roles of arginine methylation and deimination of the multifunctional nuclear proteins PSF and p54nrb	Arginine methylation is now emerging as a mainstream post translational modification of proteins, similar to protein phosphorylation. It has recently been shown that the methylation of arginines on histones can be antagonised enzymatically via deimination of arginine to citrulline, and it is therefore dynamic in nature. This offers exciting prospects that arginine methylation, as a eukaryotic post translational modification, may mirror phosphorylation in its level of complexity. Many RNA binding proteins undergo arginine methylation as a post translational modification. The methylation of arginine residues is thought to structurally alter the protein and therefore perturb protein- protein or protein nucleic interactions. We have recently used novel enrichment procedures to purify the multi protein nuclear complex from Hela nuclear cell extracts in which PSF (polypyrimidine tract-binding protein associated splicing factor) is bound to p54nrb/NonO (Non-POU-domain-containing, octamer-binding protein) and identified sites of arginine methylation in the protein PSF. It is proposed to characterise the sites of arginine methylation and citrullination of the multi-functional nuclear proteins PSF and p54nrb and further explore the roles of such modifications. It is proposed to overexpress, in E.coli, the human PSF and p54nrb proteins. Following overexpression and purification of the PSF and p54nrb proteins it is proposed to analyse the sites of arginine methylation and citrullination, following incubation of the proteins with arginine methyltrasnferases and pepidyl arginine deiminases in vitro. Mass spectrometry will be used to identify the sites of the modifications. In addition the sites of arginine methylation and citrullination will be analysed in vivo. The PSF-p54nrb complex will be enriched from Hela nuclear cell extracts using novel open tube capillaries and the sites of such modifications will be analysed using mass spectrometry. To aid the identifications of the sites of such modifications using mass spectrometry, it is proposed to develop a variety of approaches including the use of stable isotopes including 13C SAM and H218O for the in vitro reactions and 13CD3 methionine for labeling and quantitation of the sites of methylation in vivo. In an approach to study the roles of the post translational modifications of PSF and p54nrb it is proposed to analyse the kinetics of the interactions of both the modified and unmodified proteins with both protein and nucleic acid substrates using surface plasmon resonance. In addition it is proposed to use proteomic approaches to identify novel interacting partners of PSF and p54nrb, moreover study the effects of arginine methylation and deimination on the interacting proteins associated with PSF and p54nrb.

2	Professor Anne Ferguson-Smith	University of Cambridge	None	None	None	Mammalian microRNAs, retrotransposons and genomic imprinting	MicroRNAs are an abundant class of RNA that are 20-25 nucleotides long, interact with target mRNAs and trigger either translational repression, RNA cleavage, or epigenetic modification. We recently identified the first two animal microRNAs with 100 per cent complementarity to an endogenous murine gene. This putative target mRNA is a retrotransposon- like gene (Rtl1) that is subject to genomic imprinting and located within a 1 Mb imprinted domain on distal mouse chromosome 12. Here we propose to determine the potential link between endogenous miRNAs, retrotransposon silencing and genomic imprinting by characterising the functional link between the miRNAs and Rtl1, and determining potential epigenetic consequences of such an interaction.

The proposed experiments will investigate the higher-order structure (chromosome folding) and functional nuclear organization (placement in the nucleus) of genes during transcriptional activity and inactivity. We have found that widely separated genes on the same chromosome often co-localize when they are transcriptionally active, at frequencies much higher than would be expected by random association. Taken together with published reports, which show high chromatin mobility, individual genes adopting distinct nuclear localizations in association with transcriptional activity and nuclear sub-compartments rich in transcriptional apparatus, these data suggest that gene activity is controlled in part by nuclear organization. We have shown that the beta-globin genes and the distal beta-globin locus control region physically associate in vivo during the process of transcription. This higher-order structure appears to be dependent on modifications to the histone tails of chromatin in sub-domains encompassing the developmentally specific genes. These modifications in turn are dependent on intergenic transcription through the subdomain region suggesting that the process of transcription or the presence of the non-coding RNA targets remodelling and histone modification factors to the sub-domains. However another non-exclusive hypothesis is that intergenic transcription itself is involved in the assembly of higher-order structures by acting as a molecular motor to pull distal regions into functional complexes. We will investigate these models and attempt to determine a hierarchy of events that take place in the normal control of gene expression. We will use state-of-the-art techniques such as RNA TRAP, 3C, and 3D confocal RNA and DNA FISH to assess higher-order chromatin structures as well as coordinate nuclear organization of genes as far apart as 40 Mb. In addition we will develop a high-throughput assay to rapidly build up information about the functional organization of the nucleus from numerous genomic perspectives. This information is vital to understanding normal gene function as well as in cases were genes are deregulated as in cancer.	Medical Research Council	Fellowship	1050561.0	GBP

Gene expression is regulated at multiple levels, with transcription having received most attention. However, additional layers of regulation, including RNA turnover and translation, may rival the sophistication and importance of transcriptional control. Mistakes at any regulatory step can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation, contributing to the complexity of cancer. Integration of data covering different aspects of gene expression related to the cell cycle, acquired under controlled conditions in a model organism, will help to fully understand gene expression programs, including the complex re-programming accompanying carcinogenesis. We pursue an integrated functional-genomic approach to analyse gene expression control throughout the fission yeast cell cycle. We plan: 1) functional studies of cell cycle-regulated transcription, addressing the roles, binding sites, and complex formation of transcription factors; 2) genome-wide mapping of histone-modification patterns; 3) global analyses of posttranscriptional regulation, measuring RNA decay and translational control, and identifying targets of RNA-binding proteins; 4) cell-cycle interference using genetic and external perturbations to reveal the plasticity of regulatory mechanisms; and 5) integration of data sets from several regulatory levels (chromatin to translation) to acquire a system-wide understanding of coordinated strategies for gene expression and cell-cycle control.

5	Dr Bycroft	Mrc Centre For Protein Engineering	None	2000-04-01	2010-09-30	Protein Structure and Function	Cells regulate the amount of a given protein in response to many different stimuli. Two processes govern this gene expression and protein turnover. One of the main aims of this research program is to gain a detailed molecular understanding of these processes. In the field of gene expression we are focusing on two areas in particular. Firstly we are interested how posttranslational modification modulates transcription. The modification of histones plays a key role in chromatin structure and function. We are studying protein modules that recognise methylated amino acids in the tails of histones and direct the assembly of large multiprotein complexes that regulate transcription. The importance of this field is highlighted by the fact that several of the proteins involved are mutated in development disorders and cancer. Chromatin structure can also be modulated by the incorporation of variant histones. We have been studying a protein module present in macroH2A, a variant histone enriched in inactive X chromosomes. We are also studying protein modules that bind to the carboxyl-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase. This domain is phosphorylated during the elongation phase of transcription. This acts as a marker for the binding of proteins involved in RNA modification, enabling the coordination of transcription and RNA processing. The second area we are interested in is dsRNA. The past five years have seen dsRNA emerge as a key regulator of gene expression. We are investigating how proteins recognise dsRNA and how dsRNA binding proteins influence mRNA stability, translation and transcription. We are also examining the mechanisms that control the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, the main system that regulates protein turnover. We are studying the assembly and function of a variety of E3 ligases, the enzymes that attach ubiquitin to proteins. One of these ligases is mutated in kidney cancers and another is encoded by the virus that causes Kaposis sarcoma. We are also studying a family of proteins that can remove ubiquitin from proteins. Finally, we are also interested in the relationship between protein quality control and the ubiquitin-proteasome system. We are also engaged in a number of programs, in collaboration with clinical research groups, in which structural and biophysical methods are used to elucidate the molecular basis of disease. We have, for example, been working on autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease one of the most common genetic disorders.	Medical Research Council	Unit	None	None

A number of genes in the mouse are imprinted, resulting in only one copy being active, either the paternal or the maternal one. Many of these imprinted genes are located clustered together in specific region of the chromosome . We are interested in understanding how these genes clusters are regulated, and particularly, the role of chromatin modification and RNA. We are also interested in testing the hypothesis that `looping of gene clusters brings distant DNA elements together and regulates gene expression.

Recent studies have demonstrated that MND is characterized by the translocation of the protein TDP-43 from the nucleus, associated with ubiquitylation and accumulated in cytoplasmic inclusions. The hypothesis that loss of normal nuclear activity of TDP-43 is important in the pathogenesis of MND will be investigated. TDP-43 is known to bind (UG)n repeat sequences in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance receptor (CTFR) gene resulting in skipping of exon 9 through alternative RNA splicing as part of the regulation of gene function. CTFR is expressed in human lower motor neurones (LMN). UG(n) sequences are also present in other genes expressed in spinal cord including those for the human cardiac Na+/Ca++ exchanger 1 (NCX1) and molecules potentially implicated in MND: AMPA glutamate receptor subunit GluR2; brain derived neurotrophic factor. I will use these genes as candidates to explore the hypothesis that reduced nuclear TDP-43 results in altered RNA splicing causing exon skipping. To do this, immunolabelled neurones with and without nuclear TDP-43 expression will be isolated by laser capture microdissection. Two-step linear amplification of RNA followed by quantitative PCR will be used to compare the proportion of spliced and unspliced transcripts. In addition, a TDP-43 knockdown model will be generated in the NSC34 cell line using a lentiviral vector. RNA splicing will be compared with NSC34 cells with normal TDP-43 expression. Positive findings from this component of the study will determine whether a change in subcellular TDP-43 localisation has demonstrable functional consequences. Whether this has pathogenic significance depends on which genes are affected. Whilst three genes are included with possible implications for MND, a wider survey of aberrant splicing would also be informative. In the second phase I will use Affymetrix GeneChips to investigate gene expression and splicing across the genome using the same comparison of neurones and cell lines with normal and abnormal nuclear TDP-43. This second component will generate additional molecular candidates of potential importance in MND. There is evidence that TDP-43 is less important in SOD1-related familial MND. The host laboratory has autopsy material from SOD1 patients, and transfected cell lines, which will allow me to include this material as an additional comparison group in both phases. The project will enable me to acquire first hand knowledge of these modern techniques for investigating human nervous system disease with applicability across the neurodegenerative disorders.

Our aim will be to dissect how RNA metabolism drives chromatin changes, an important question in many areas of biology. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments will be used to explore the relationship between RNA processing and recruitment of FCA to FLC. We will characterize in an unbiased way all the FLC sense and antisense transcripts in different genotypes and define the RNA species to which FCA binds in vivo. In order to establish the generality of our findings we will also explore the genome-wide RNA features recognized by FCA and work collaboratively with Dr H. Chang (Stanford University) who is exploring how non-coding RNAs drive chromatin changes at mammalian HOX loci. Chromatin immunoprecipitation will be used to explore the requirements for FLD association to FLC chromatin and determine if the association of the chromatin regulator, FLD, to its target FLC is dependent on the RNA metabolic activities of FCA and FY. Working collaboratively with Prof. Y.

10	Dr Scadden	University of Cambridge	None	None	2012-07-30	Tudor Staphylococcal Nuclease and cleavage of inosine-containing dsRNA	Long dsRNA in cells may undergo hyper-editing by adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs), whereby up to 50 percent of adenosine (A) residues are converted to inosine (I). Such extensive modification results in localized distortions of the RNA helix, as IU and UI pairs have a different geometry to Watson-Crick AU and UA base pairs. Hyper-editing by ADARs therefore effectively 'tags' the dsRNA for subsequent recognition by various proteins. Inosine-containing dsRNA (I-dsRNA) is specifically cleaved in various cytoplasmic extracts. In contrast, dsRNAs containing isosteric GU or UG pairs (G-dsRNA) is not cleaved. We propose that cleavage of I-dsRNA is important for disposal of hyper-edited viral dsRNA, or for other inappropriately edited cellular dsRNAs. Moreover, cleavage of I-dsRNA may be important for turning off the pathway whereby I-dsRNA acts to reduce gene expression. Previously we have shown that Tudor Staphylococcal Nuclease (TSN), a component of RISC in the RNAi pathway, specifically binds to and enhances cleavage of I-dsRNA. Conversely, a specific inhibitor of staphylococcal nucleases (pdTp) inhibits cleavage. However, TSN alone is insufficient for cleavage of I-dsRNA. It is therefore likely that additional proteins are required; these may stabilize the binding of TSN to I-dsRNA, or regulate its activity. Alternatively, while the cleavage of I-dsRNA is consistent with TSN playing a direct role, we cannot rule out the possibility that TSN recruits another nuclease that specifically cleaves I-dsRNA. We aim to identify the co- factors of TSN that may be required for specific cleavage of I-dsRNA. We will subsequently characterize their interactions with both TSN and I-dsRNA, and to investigate their potential role in cleaving I-dsRNA. We will also carry out experiments to elucidate the structures of both I- and G-dsRNA, in order to determine why I-dsRNA is uniquely susceptible to cleavage.

11	Professor David Lilley	University of Dundee	None	2008-10-01	2011-09-30	Studies of nucleic acid structure and interactions with proteins	Work in this laboratory is focussed on the structure, folding and dynamics of nucleic acids, both DNA and RNA. It also includes the interaction of proteins with branchpoints in nucleic acids. In principle projects in a number of these areas are possible, depending upon the interest of the person. These projects would suit someone with training in biochemistry/molecular biology plus a strong background in physical science. The work would cover molecular biology (mutagenesis and expression of recombinant proteins) and biophysical studies such as fluorescence (including single-molecule studies), X-ray scattering, electron paramagnetic resonance and possibly crystallography. Interaction between enzymes and DNA Holliday junctions. We have made a detailed study of the interactions of Holliday junction-resolving enzymes with four-way junctions in DNA. Four-way DNA junctions are central intermediates in genetic recombination, a key process in mediating the repair and rearrangement of cellular DNA. Defects in these processes are associated with human cancer. Junction-resolving enzymes recognise the structure of DNA junctions, and bring about their cleavage to duplex products - the resolution process. Binding is fundamentally dependent on the branched structure of the junction, yet the enzymes also manipulate the structure. This distortion is intimately associated with catalysis. We have had particular success with endonuclease I, including solving the first crystal structure of a junction-resolving enzymes bound to four-way junction. We now propose to exploit this progress to study the yeast resolving enzyme Cce1. This makes the largest distortion of a junction on binding, including breaking basepairs. We have a number of spectroscopic signals to follow (eg 2-aminopurine) and this is well-suited to single-molecule FRET analysis of binding, distortion and cleavage processes. We also intend to perform crystallisation trials for the complex with a DNA junction, building on our success with endonuclease I. Interaction between proteins and kink-turns in RNA The kink-turn (k-turn) is a new structural motif that is widespread in natural RNA species, playing a key role in folding into the functional form. It generates a tightly-kinked structure in the RNA that can facilitate long-range tertiary contacts and hence organise RNA structure on a large scale. K-turns frequently serve as protein binding sites. These structures were first identified at several locations in crystal structures of ribosomal subunits, but have also been found in mRNA, box C/D and H/ACA guide RNAs and spliceosomal RNA. They are thus important in translation, RNA modification, spliceosome assembly and the control of gene expression. We have made a detailed study of the H-bonding interactions that stabilize the k-turn, and now propose to examine a number of functionally-important structures that are non-standard sequences, especially in the two key AoG pairs that flank the bulge. A case of particular interest is the box C/D snoRNA that guides site-specific methylation in the nucleolus. This has two potential k-turns; one is standard, the other deviant. The first event in the formation of the nucleoprotein assembly is the binding of the L7Ae protein, stabilising the C/D k-turn in its kinked form. The protein binds to such a standard k-turn with an affinity of 30 pM - such a high affinity can only be measured by stopped-flow kinetic measurements of on and off rates. However, the second k-turn (so-called C'/D') is very non-standard, and it is far from clear how this participates in the assembly of the snoRNP. We will therefore isolate this sequence and study its folding properties, induces by Mg ions and by L7Ae protein. We will then work back to the full assembly. For this we plan to use a combination of single-molecule FRET, EPR using spin-labelled RNA molecules, and SAXS. We will also collaborate with Dr Hong Li (Florida State) to examining the assembly of the snoRNP following the binding of the L7Ae protein. Some relevant references. A.-C. Déclais and D.M.J.

12	Dr Michal Minczuk	Medical Research Council	None	2009-04-01	2017-02-28	Mitochondrial Genetics	Human mitochondria have their own genome (mtDNA) that is two hundred thousand times smaller that the nuclear genome (nDNA) and encodes only thirteen essential subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) machinery. Given the relatively small size of the mitochondrial genome our detailed understanding of the molecular mechanism that govern mitochondrial gene maintenance and expression is still surprisingly sketchy. Defects of mtDNA and nDNA are well-recognised cause of genetic disorders that have diverse clinical manifestations ranging from progressive muscle weakness to fatal infantile disease. Much of our understanding of mitochondrial molecular genetics has come from studying rare mitochondrial disorders. Currently there are no effective treatments for these diseases and there are very few animal models for them. The slow progress in gathering more data on how mitochondrial genome is regulated is, in large part, owing to our current inability to edit mtDNA. Genome engineering techniques, analogous to the ones routinely used to modify the nuclear DNA, are not in hand, so we are unable to interrogate the role of cis-acting elements for RNA expression as well as transcription or replication. Furthermore, we are still unable to introduce pathogenic mtDNA mutations at will so their effect could be studied in animal models. In particular, the programme focuses on: (i) Studying the basic mechanisms of mitochondrial genome regulation with the main focus on the novel proteins responsible for nuclolytic processing of precursor mitochondrial RNA, polyadenylation of mitochondrial messenger RNA, post-transcriptional nucleotide modification of mitochondrial RNA and mitoribosome biogenesis. (ii) The analysis of the key aspects of mitochondrial genome regulation in samples derived from patients affected with mitochondrial disease. This analysis is a source of valuable insights into the pathomechanisms of human disease, and also into basic mitochondrial molecular genetics. Importantly. They provide patients with a molecular diagnosis for prevention (prenatal genetic diagnosis) and counselling. (iii) Developing new approaches for the genetic modification of mitochondria of living cells. The key long-term aim is to establish routine methods of genetic modification of mammalian mitochondria. Enzymatic methods are being developed to modify the mitochondrial genome e.g. engineered zinc finger nucleases are delivered to mitochondria in order to deplete cells selectively of specific mtDNA variants.

13	Dr Elizabeth Bayne	University of Edinburgh	Sch of Biological Sciences	2011-01-01	2016-09-30	Mechanism and regulation of RNA-directed chromatin modification.	An understanding of genome regulation is essential for understanding disease. Recent studies have revealed that non-coding (nc)RNAs have widespread roles in genome regulation, including transcriptional silencing via chromatin modification. Despite this, the molecular mechanisms underlying such RNA-directed chromatin modification (RdCM) remain poorly understood. My aim is to understand the mechanism, regulation and roles of RdCM, using the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a model system. Heterochromatin formation at fission yeast centromeres is an excellent paradigm for RdCM in general. Chromatin modification is known to require non-coding centromeric RNAs, processed by the RNAi intereference (RNAi) pathway. However, the mechanism by which RNAi recruits chromatin modifiers has remained obscure. My first objective is to elucidate the mechanism of RdCM by determining the functions of four novel proteins I have identified as being involved in RdCM. One of these proteins, Stc1, plays a key role in linking RNAi to chromatin modification; I will characterise the functions of Stc1 to determine the molecular mechanism by which Stc1 mediates RNAi-dependent chromatin modification. I will also determine the roles of the other three proteins in facilitating RdCM. My second objective is to identify and characterise negative regulators of RdCM. Ectopic chromatin modification can down-regulate essential genes, a cause of cancer. Proper regulation is therefore critical, but despite this, little is known about regulators of RdCM. I will perform genetic screens to identify proteins that negatively regulate RdCM, and determine their mode of action. My third objective is to characterise alternative roles of RdCM. Thus far studies in fission yeast have focussed on the role of RdCM in maintaining constitutive heterochromatin. However, preliminary data suggests that, as in higher eukaryotes, RNAi/RdCM also regulates retroelements and certain genes. I will determine the mechanisms and roles of ncRNA-mediated regulation at these loci, and examine how these pathways may contribute to stress responses. These studies will address specific questions about the mechanism and regulation of RdCM, and broaden the scope of fission yeast as a model for ncRNA-mediated genome regulation. The characterisation of these pathways in yeast and identification of homologous components in other species will form a basis for future studies aimed at understanding analogous pathways in humans. Changes in ncRNAs and defects in RdCM have been linked to numerous diseases, so understanding the mechanisms and regulation of RdCM will help us to understand many diseases associated with mis-regulation of gene expression in humans.

Tumour hypoxia drives cancer treatment resistance and reduces the efficacy of radiotherapy. There is evidence hypoxia-modification strategies improve outcome in head and neck cancer (HNSCC) patients, where those with hypoxic versus oxygenated tumours are most likely to benefit. Background Microarray gene expression profiling of 59 HNSCC produced a hypoxia-associated 99-gene signature that was prognostic in both a publicly available HNSCC dataset and a widely studied breast cancer series. A reduced/refined 30-gene hypoxia signature was subsequently developed with greater prognostic significance. Aims 1) Test whether our 99-gene signature can identify patients who will benefit from hypoxia-modifying treatment. 2) Explore the predictive significance of our reduced 30-gene signature. 3) Explore whether the signature can be further refined by contributing to either a hypoxia meta-signature (tumour-type independent) or a tumour-specific signature. Research Plan The BCON trial randomised bladder cancer patients to radiotherapy with/without hypoxia modification. RNA extracted from archived BCON tumour samples will be used for expression profiling to determine the ability of the 99- and 30-gene hypoxia signatures to predict benefit from hypoxia modification.

We will identify candidate targets in triplicate by utilising the foremost iTRAQ LC-MS and gel free 2D fractionation technologies of our Centre for Excellence in Mass Spectroscopy (http://www.york.ac.uk/mass-spectrometry). This strategy is up the fifty times more sensitive than standard methods. We will compare results with those previously isolated (Ferreira et al., 2014). Biochemical analysis of PRMT7 enzyme function: We will conduct in vitro methyltransferase assays using [3H]AdoMet and recombinant PRMT7 and target candidates and high resolution cation exchange chromatography will be used to verify monomethyl arginine formation by PRMT7. We have created distinct variants of tagged PRMT7 proteins with targeted mutations in the putative catalytic centre, necessary for enzymatic function, which are in process of being confirmed. Through in vitro pull down and directed methylation assays, we seek to test the functional integrity of PRMT7 mutants versus wild type proteins on candidate targets. Characterisation of RBP target function in presence/absence of PRMT7: We will isolate associating transcriptomes of two confirmed, prioritised RNA binding protein targets of PRMT7 and test whether RNA interactions are changed in PRMT7 knockout parasites. Associating RNAs will be identified in triplicate via RNA Hi Seq at the MRC Centre for Genomic Research, Liverpool. The Mass spectroscopy and RNA Sequencing results will require substantial bioinformatics analyses for interpretation and prioritisation.

It is crucial for all cellular functions and widely disrupted in disease rendering its full understanding an essential biological goal. mRNA maturation is coordinated with transcription via phosphorylation ofthe C-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (Pol II). CTD modification is thought to constitute a code that orchestrates transcriptional and mRNA maturation eventsand we will investigate how this is formed and interpreted using human cells as our model.Specifically, we will: 1. Delineate how CTD kinase activity is co-transcriptionally controlled and how this impacts on mRNA processing. 2. Use new genome-editing approaches to dissect catalytic and physical functions of three important CTD kinases: Cdk9, Cdk12 and Cdk13. 3. Employ novel proteomics to reveal the full CTD interactome and how it is remodelled by kinase activity.	Wellcome Trust	Investigator Award in Science	911621.0	GBP

Previously, we demonstrated that PRMT7 levels are inversely proportional to Leishmania parasite virulence (Ferreira et al., 2014). We will first dissect exactly how PRMT7 levels impact parasite virulence in mammalian cells. We will do this by genetically increasing and decreasing levels of PRMT7 enzyme and tracking parasite differentiation capacity to metacyclic (mammalian transmissive) versus amastigote (mammalian-infective) lifecycle stage parasites using stage-specific markers including RNA and protein expression, human serum sensitivity and proliferation. We will further examine whether levels of PRMT7 impact the disease-causing amastigotes' ability to infect and proliferate within human immune cells to discriminate differentiation capacity from virulence. We will verify candidate trans-regulatory RNA binding protein (RBP) targets of PRMT7 by in vitro biochemical methylation analyses and genetically manipulate target RBP levels to examine their potential role in parasite virulence. Preliminary in vitro data supports a direct interaction in which E.coli-derived PRMT7 modifies target RBPs in an arginine glycine (RGG-motif) dependent manner. If a candidate trans-regulator is confirmed to be both a target of PRMT7 and implicit in parasite differentiation and/or virulence, we will isolate associating transcripts and examine whether PRMT7 and RBP levels regulate these RNAs. Lastly, we will examine the structure/function relationship of target RBP trans-regulators in the presence/absence of PRMT7, methylation, protein binding partners, and associating RNAs using a variety of complementary biochemical, biophysical and structural techniques. We have already established protocols for production of recombinant RBPs which we can methylate in vitro using recombinant PRMT7.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	269468.0	GBP
19	Dr Elli Papaemmanuil	University of Cambridge	None	2015-01-01	2020-12-31	Interpret: Clinical and biological implications of acquired somatic mutations in myeloid neoplasms	Background Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a prevalent group of chronic haematological malignancies characterised by dysplasia, ineffective haematopoiesis and a risk of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia. Systematic screens of MDS genomes have identified recurrent mutations in genes implicated in RNA splicing, DNA modification, chromatin regulation and cell signaling. Whilst these findings improve our understanding in the molecular etiology of this disease little is known about the direct biological consequences of these mutations. Coupled with extensive morphological and molecular heterogeneity in MDS, both diagnosis and patient risk stratification remains challenging. Aims To translate novel molecular discoveries into clinical practice, this proposals aims to: characterise the direct biological consequences of gene mutations in MDS; study genotype correlations with diagnostic and morphological variables; evaluate recent genomic technologies for utility in front-line diagnosis of MDS; correlate gene mutations with patient outcome and therapeutic response and assess the prognostic relevance of genetic variables; identify novel avenues for therapeutic intervention in high risk MDS patients. Methods A large cohort of patients with MDS and closely related neoplasms will be ascertained retrospectively from established clinical trials as well as prospectively in collaboration with regional haemato-oncology laboratories. A targeted sequencing protocol containing selected genes will be performed on diagnostic as well as where available, sequential samples acquired at treatment stages, disease progression and relapse. Gene-gene interactions will be studied to ascertain patterns of co-mutation, mutual exclusivity and clonal complexity. To study the direct consequences of gene mutations in gene regulation and transcriptional control, samples from patients with representative genotypes will be selected for detailed genomic profiling studies including transcriptome and methylation profiling of single cells or single cell-derived colonies and sequential samples. Methodologies will be developed to study the relative and combined contributions of genetic variables in dictating clinical phenotype, therapeutic response and patient outcome. Samples in which no mutations are identified or with outlier clinical course will be included in further genome characterisation studies to support the identification of novel mechanisms of leukaemogenesis. How the results of this research will be used The proposed study will deliver a detailed characterisation of the molecular architecture that underpins MDS. Methodologies to assess complex interactions and correlations amongst large-scale genomic variables and clinical outcome, relevant to all cancer studies, will be developed. Most importantly, findings from this study will provide an evidence-based resource that will inform design of biomarker led clinical trials and shape future clinical practices in haemato-oncology.

20	Prof Adrian Whitehouse	Leeds University	None	2017-01-01	2019-12-31	Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus modulation of a RNA modification pathway: a novel antiviral strategy	This proposal will investigate how and why the oncogenic herpesvirus, Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), manipulates the host cell pseudouridylation pathway. Pseudouridylation is a RNA modification which has recently been shown to occur in mRNAs. Although remarkably, its biological significance remains poorly defined. Intriguingly, however recent findings suggest that pseudouridylation is a dynamic mRNA modification, varying in response to stress states in both yeast and human cells. Therefore pseudouridylation may have a critical role in regulating gene expression, analogous to dynamically regulated DNA and protein modifications. As such, understanding how and why KSHV manipulates this dynamic RNA modification may provide novel insights into the fundamental regulatory aspects of pseudouridylation in KSHV gene expression and highlight a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of this important human tumour virus. Our exciting preliminary data shows that KSHV infection leads to the subcellular redistribution of pseudouridine synthetases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that KSHV mRNAs contain functional pseudouridylation sites and inhibition of pseudouridine synthetases significantly reduce KSHV lytic replication and infectious virion production. Therefore, the aim of this project is to determine what implications KSHV-mediated manipulation of the pseudouridylation pathway has for the fate and function of viral and cellular mRNAs during infection and assess the potential of pseudouridylation has a novel antiviral strategy. To this end, we will firstly identify the transcriptome-wide changes in the pseudouridylation status of cellular and KSHV mRNAs during the course of infection. Secondly, the effect of pseudouridylation on the fate and function of viral mRNAs will be examined. Thirdly, the impact of KSHV-mediated manipulation of pseudouridine synthetases on cellular mRNAs will be assessed. Finally we will assess the potential of inhibiting the pseudouridylation pathway as a novel antiviral strategy for KSHV-associated malignancies.	Worldwide Cancer Research	Project Grant	199737.0	GBP

For example, microRNA (miRNA) expression can be influenced at various steps of biosynthesis. Furthermore, it has been reported that direct RNA methylation events can also affect gene expression in many different organisms and systems. The aim of this project is to identify and characterize factors that affect the maturation of miRNAs. We will employ biochemical pull down assays to isolate specific binding partners of different miRNA species. We will analyze the physiological role of these factors using molecular or cell biological approaches. Molecular details of pre-miRNA-protein interactions will be investigated by x-ray crystallography. In addition, we will decipher the role of the m6A methylation pathway on the regulation of coding and non-coding RNAs. Writers, readers and erasers of this modification have been identified. However, not much is known about the composition of specific protein complexes as well as the atomic structure of these factors. Thus, we will functionally and structurally characterize known and putative novel factors of the m6A methylation pathway in human cells. Furthermore, using our biochemical pull down approach employed for the identification of pre-miRNA processing factors, we will identify reader proteins of several types of RNA modification that have not been investigated so far. The proposed project will elucidate the regulation of gene expression by small RNAs or direct RNA methylation and will add so far unknown components to these important regulatory pathways.

22	Prof Adrian Whitehouse	University of Leeds	None	2015-09-01	2018-08-31	Viral control of the m6A methylome	m6A methylation is a common base modification present in eukaryotic mRNA. However, its biological significance is still poorly understood. Recent technological advances have shown that m6A methylation occurs in >7000 transcripts and has also led to the identification of enzymes which make this RNA modification dynamic and reversible. As such, reversible m6A methylation may have critical roles in gene regulation analogous to dynamically regulated DNA and protein modifications. Thus, dynamically reversible RNA modifications, such as m6A methylation, represent an emerging layer of gene regulation at the RNA level, termed RNA epigenetics or epitranscriptomics. We have exciting preliminary data to suggest Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) manipulates pathways which regulate m6A methylation. As such, this provides an excellent model to study the fundamental regulatory aspects of m6A methylation at an RNA epigenetic level. Our preliminary data shows that the KSHV ORF57 protein redistributes the recently identified RNA m6A demethylase, human fat mass and obesity (FTO)-associated protein, from nuclear speckles into the nucleolus. Moreover, this redistribution results in alterations within the m6A methylation status of viral and cellular mRNAs. Specifically, FTO redistribution dramatically reverses viral mRNA m6A methylation while increasing cellular mRNA m6A methylation status. The aim of this project is to determine what implications virus-mediated FTO redistribution and manipulation of the m6A methylation pathway has upon cellular and viral m6A methylomes. We will examine what effect altering the m6A methylation status has upon the fate and function of viral and cellular mRNAs. In addition, we will test the requirement of FTO redistribution and alterations in the m6A methylome for virus replication and assess the therapeutic potential of inhibiting this virus-based manipulation of the m6A methylation pathway as a novel antiviral strategy.

While an appropriate function of MDA5 is important for effective immune defense against viral infection, my recent study showed that its dysregulated activity via gain-of-function (GOF) mutations can lead to an inflammatory disease, Aicardi-Goutière Syndrome (AGS) (Nat. Genetics, 2014). While this work has highlighted the importance of regulated innate immune sensing of nucleic acids, it also raised several questions as to the molecular mechanisms by which these mutations cause chronic inflammation. The goal of this proposal is to further elucidate the mechanisms of AGS pathogenesis, in particular the potential relationship between MDA5 and a dsRNA modifying enzyme, ADAR1, of which loss-of-function (LOF) mutation has been previously shown to also cause AGS. I hypothesize that MDA5 and ADAR1 represent two balancing arms of the immune-tolerance relationship. Modification of cellular dsRNA, such as inverted repeats of retrotransposon elements by ADAR1 may prevent their recognition by wild-type MDA5, whereas GOF mutations in MDA5 allows stimulation by ADAR1-modified dsRNAs as endogenous agonist. I plan to test these hypotheses using a combination of biochemical and cellular assays in conjunction with computational modeling to obtain structural insights. This project builds upon previous work from our laboratory on the structural and biochemical mechanisms of MDA5 and related innate immune systems, as well as a close collaboration with Dr. Luigi Notarangelo’s lab at Boston Children’s Hospital, who has been investigating the disease mechanism of several immune disorders. I believe that the proposed research may not only provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of AGS, but would also help us define a new paradigm of the complex interplays between the pathogen sensing mechanism and cellular RNA modification.

Many of the cancer cell properties that have been detected or proposed decades ago, including their heterogeneity despite clonal origin and their capacity to subvert the host tissue stroma, have yet to be fully understood and metastasis, the main cause of cancer-related death, remains virtually unscathed by the therapeutic arsenal currently at hand. To complicate issues further, it is becoming increasingly clear that epigenetic changes may play a key role in tumor progression and resistance to therapy and even override the influence of genetic mutations themselves. The long term goal of this project is to acquire a better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie cancer initiation, development and progression with the hope that such understanding will help identify new therapeutic targets and lead to rationally designed, effective therapeutic strategies. We have chosen to work on sarcomas, which include some of the most aggressive tumors, often arising in children and young adults and associated with a somber prognosis despite multimodal therapy. Because these malignancies have not been investigated as intensely as the more common carcinomas, they are still poorly understood from a biological standpoint. The short term goal is to determine the nature of tumor cell heterogeneity in sarcomas, the properties that distinguish sarcoma stem/initiator cells (CSC/CIC) from the bulk of tumor cells, including their chromatin modifications and bioenergetics, the possibilities to distinctly target CSC/CIC therapeutically and the mechanisms that render mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSC/MPC) permissive for specific oncogene expression and action and thereby elucidate how sarcomas are generated. These issues will be addressed using Ewing sarcoma family tumors (ESFT) as a model, but other sarcoma types, and possibly other malignancies will be investigated as the project unfolds. The specific aims are as follows:Specific Aim 1: Assessment of the effect of targeted therapy, alone or in combination with standard of care treatment, on ESFT CSC/CIC and tumor growth. This section will include:1.1. Analysis of the effect of fluoroquinolones alone on primary ESFT growth in vivo ; 1.2. Analysis of the effect of combined standard of care and fluoroquinolone treatment on primary ESFT growth in vivo;1.3. Assessment of the properties of residual tumors following single and combined therapy in terms of tumor initiation, clonogenicity and resistance to therapy ;1.4. Assessment of the broader applicability of fluoroquinolones in CSC targeting: investigation of their effect alone or in combination with conventional therapy in glioblastomas;Specific Aim 2: Determination of epigenetic mechanisms that regulate ESFT CSC properties. This section will include:2.1. Determination of chromatin modification in spherogenic versus adherent cells;2.2. Determination of chromatin modification in CD133+ versus CD133- cells;2.3 RNA-seq analysis of CD133+ versus CD133- cells and assessment of 3’UTR length;Specific Aim 3: Assessment of the epigenetic changes in MSC grown under different culture conditions. This section will include:3.1. Assessment of chromatin modifications in MSC grown in KO versus normal medium;3.2. Assessment of chromatin modifications of MSC grown as spheres versus adherent cells;3.3. Assessment of chromatin modifications of MSC expressing EWS-FLI1; Specific Aim 4: Assessment of ESFT CSC bioenergetics as viewed through the function of Imp2 and the requirement or not for oxidative phosphorylation. This section will include:4.1. Assessment of mRNA binding by Imp2 in ESFT CSC versus bulk cells;4.2.

Disease course is usually aggressive and still only a minority of patients can be cured despite improvements in long-term survival rates over the past decades. With the advent of massively parallel (next-generation) sequencing the mutational landscape of adult de novo AML has been elucidated and this has led to a paradigm shift in the understanding of leukemia development. In contrast to the previous model of leukemogenesis that was based on the concept that mutations in signaling pathways (class 1 mutations) leading to uncontrolled proliferation must co-occur with mutations in transcription factors (class 2 mutations) leading to blocked normal myeloid differentiation, current data suggest a more complex molecular pathogenesis. Although the number of recurrently mutated genes in AML is relatively small and adult de novo AML genomes contain only 3-4 driver mutations on average, recurrent mutations affect genes with multiple cellular functions including transcription factors, epigenetic modification and RNA splicing. Mutations in TP53 which encodes the fundamental tumor suppressor p53 can be found in approximately 5% of de novo and up to 30% of therapy-related AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients and are associated with a particularly dismal prognosis with very poor long-term survival even in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.Thus, better pre-clinical in vitro and animal models are urgently needed to both study the molecular mechanisms of TP53-mutant leukemia as well as to identify synthetic lethal interactions that may represent potential therapeutic targets.To achieve this goal, I will combine several experimental strategies. In a first step, I will generate an isogenic cell culture-based model of TP53-mutant AML. In a second step, I will use various complementary experimental approaches including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, IP-MS and a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 in vitro loss-of-function genetic screen to identify potentially 'druggable' synthetic lethal interactions using the TP53-mutant isogenic AML cell lines. Last, I will use mouse models of TP53-mutant AML to validate putative therapeutic targets in vivo. The findings will not only be informative on basic principles of the pathogenesis of TP53-mutant AML, but importantly, may hold the promise to improve therapies for patients suffering from TP53-mutant leukemia.

26	Stéphane Thore	University of Geneva	Département de Biologie Moléculaire Faculté des Sciences Université de Genève	2012-10-01	2014-09-30	RNA modification: From editing to polyuridylation.	Adenine and Uridine (A/U) nucleotides within RNA sequences drive critical processes in RNA biology (RNA transcription, RNA translation, RNA degradation). My laboratory uses X-ray crystallography to study several types of nucleic acid modification/maturation machinery specific for A/U residues including Adenosine-to-Inosine (A-to-I) and Cytidine-to-Uridine (C-to-U) deamination, polyuridylation reaction, tRNA thiolation and pseudouridine formation. The present proposal has three aims covering the two following goals: Understand the basis of protein selectivity toward RNA targets and elucidate enzymatic mechanisms.•Aim 1: Identify the 'PPR code'. The pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR)-containing proteins are specific RNA-binding proteins with multiple functions (RNA editing, RNA processing, RNA translation...). Individual PPR motifs are suggested to recognize individual nucleotides within the RNA binding sequences. The research field is expecting an atomic model to proceed further with the PPR code hypothesis. We focused our attention on the Maize protein PPR10 with 17 PPR motifs which specifically recognizes a 17 nucleotide long RNA site. We will then generate point mutations followed by in vitro characterization to verify the proposed code.•Aim 2: Understand the poly(U) polymerase processivity. Polyuridylation is the most recently discovered mechanism by which RNA stability is regulated. Multiple proteins have been shown to add one or several uridine nucleotides at the 3'-end of RNA. The molecular basis behind the selection of the RNA to be modified, its movement after UMP addition and the signal to control the length of the poly(U) stretch are currently unclear. This last point is central to the functional differences existing between the members of this protein family. The Cid1 protein is the founding member of the poly(U) polymerase protein family. We have diffracting crystals of this protein. Our Cid1 structure will give us the necessary tools to test the RNA channeling hypothesis.•Aim 3: Establish tRNA binding specificity and thiolation reaction mechanism. In eukaryote, the last step of the tRNA thiolation reaction is performed by the heterodimeric protein complex CTU1/CTU2. This complex transfers a sulfur atom at the tRNA position 34 (the so-called 'wobble' position). This modification is only found in three tRNAs. No molecular information is available regarding the reaction mechanism or concerning the specific selection of these three tRNAs. We have produced the CTU1/CTU2 complex, alone and with the substrate carrier, the URM1 protein. Crystallization screens are ongoing. We have an active collaboration with the group of S. Leidel to characterize the CTU function in vivo coincidently and upon availability of the atomic model(s).Diffraction data or preliminary crystallisation screens are already ongoing. Atomic models and crystals are expected within the time frame of the proposal. Additional biochemical studies will be performed to expand our structural understanding of these critical RNA maturation/modification players simultaneously and once molecular models will be available.

Project summaryBackground: Coronaviruses are RNA viruses of both veterinary and medical importance. In humans, coronavirus infections manifest usually as mild upper respiratory tract disease (common cold), however, the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), exemplified the zoonotic potential of coronaviruses and their ability to seriously impact also on human health. Therefore, we have to extend our knowledge on critical coronavirus-host interactions and basic mechanisms of viral RNA synthesis in order to develop novel and efficacious coronavirus vaccines and inhibitors.During our previous SNF-funded projects we have identified a number of coronaviral domains and functions that critically impact on pathogenicity. The identification of the replicase-encoded non-structural protein (nsp) 1 as a major pathogenicity factor led to the development of a novel type of live attenuated vaccines based on a modified coronavirus replicase gene. Furthermore, we discovered that the inactivation of replicase gene-encoded RNA-modifying enzymes by reverse genetics resulted in highly attenuated virus mutants in vivo, whereas virus replication in cell culture was only marginally affected. These functions include the nsp14-encoded N7-methyltransferase activity, the nsp15-encoded endonuclease activity, and the nsp16-encoded 2’O-methyltransferase activity. Our preliminary data suggest that these RNA-modifying enzymes are involved in host innate immune responses and therefore represent attractive targets for antiviral intervention and for the generation of rationally designed coronavirus vaccines.Working hypothesis: We hypothesize that modification of viral mRNA, such as N7- and 2’O-methylation, impact on two fundamental cellular processes, namely (mRNA 5’-cap-dependent) protein synthesis and the detection of molecular signatures for non-self RNA recognition. The reverse genetic system for the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in combination with a murine model for coronavirus infection allows for the use of genetically modified virus and host strains to assess the biological consequences of RNA methylation. Furthermore, it will be important to analyze the spatial-temporal molecular interactions within infected primary target cells with a particular focus on imaging interactions between pathogen recognition receptors, antiviral effector proteins, viral RNA, and the viral replicase-transcriptase complex. These studies will increase our understanding on foreign RNA recognition by the innate arm of the immune system and control of mRNA translation under cellular stress conditions, such as virus infection.Specific aims: The first aim of the project is to perform detailed phenotypic analyses of recombinant MHV mutants that are deficient in particular RNA-modifying enzymes. These studies will be complemented by high resolution imaging analyses (aim 2) of infected cells using confocal laser and electron microscopy.Expected significance: The proposed studies on the function of viral RNA-modifying enzymes and the nature of viral RNA modifications will provide general insights into the biology of RNA sensing. Furthermore, viruses rely on the host cell’s translational machinery for protein synthesis, and thus control of mRNA translation represents an important focus for virus-host interactions. Therefore, a better understanding of viral RNA-modifying enzymes will facilitate the development of novel antiviral drugs and as well as the rational design of live attenuated viral vaccines.

Infektionskrankheiten und Pathologie Universität Bern	None	2014-04-01	2017-08-31	Host innate immune responses to viral RNA	"Host innate immune responses to viral RNA"1. Project summaryBackground: Coronaviruses are RNA viruses of both veterinary and medical importance. The SARS-CoV epidemic 2002/2003, and the recent emergence of the novel human coronavirus EMC, exemplified the zoonotic potential of coronaviruses and their ability to seriously impact on human health. Notably, in most cell types neither high nor low pathogenic coronaviruses elicit pronounced innate immune responses, such as type-I interferons (IFNs), during the early phase of viral infection, suggesting that coronaviruses counteract sensing of viral nucleic acid. During our previous SNF-funded projects we have uncovered a link between Mda5-mediated sensing of coronaviral RNA and ribose 2’O-methylation, suggesting that RNA modifications such as 2’O-methylation provide a molecular signature for discrimination of self and non-self mRNA. More recently, by assessing a coronaviral inhibitor targeting membrane-bound RNA synthesis, we found that inhibitor-resistant viruses can efficiently replicate without inducing double-membrane vesicles (DMVs). These DMVs are a hallmark of coronavirus replication and harbor dsRNA. Therefore, these inhibitor-resistant viruses represent an excellent tool to study sensing of viral RNA and antiviral effector mechanisms under conditions where dsRNA is not shielded by DMVs but accessible to binding by host cell cytosolic RNA sensors.Working hypothesis and aims: We hypothesize that induction of innate immune responses to viral RNA and restriction of RNA virus replication is dependent on (i) modification of viral mRNA, such as 2’O-methylation, and (ii) localization of viral RNA in the host cell. Furthermore, innate immune responses and restriction of RNA virus replication appears to be very different in particular cell types, depending on which particular innate immune pathways and antiviral mechanisms dominate. The reverse genetic systems for the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) in combination with murine and human models of infection that are amenable to genetic modification will allow us to dissect key steps and key molecules involved in host innate immune responses on the molecular level. It will be important to analyze the molecular interactions within infected primary target cells with a particular focus on interactions between pathogen recognition receptors, antiviral effector proteins, dsRNA, and the viral replicase-transcriptase complex. To do this we will generate a number of recombinant murine and human coronaviruses that are deficient in 2’O-methylation, contain inhibitor-resistant mutations and combinations thereof. Using these novel tools we will then assess innate immune responses in primary human and murine cells in order to obtain a detailed view on kinetics and quality of innate immune responses under well-defined conditions. These studies will provide spatial and temporal view of basic principles of RNA recognition and antiviral innate immune mechanisms in different primary cell types following virus infection. Expected significance: The proposed studies will provide general insights into the biology of viral RNA sensing and antiviral effector mechanisms that are highly relevant also beyond coronavirus infections. We expect to identify key mediators of viral RNA sensing and the “antiviral state” that are apparently counteracted by many RNA viruses through methylation of viral mRNA and shielding of dsRNA by host cell membranes. Therefore, a better understanding of these fundamental aspects of innate immune responses to RNA virus infection will facilitate the development of novel strategies to interfere with viral RNA replication during the early phase of infections.

G4-forming sequences are strikingly rare in the AT-rich P. falciparum genome, and are concentrated around the major family of virulence genes, called var genes. Our recent work has showed that G4 motifs may affect the expression and recombination of var genes, thus contributing to antigenic variation and diversification. Special classes of helicases are required to unwind G4s and we have knocked out two of these helicases in P. falciparum, revealing phenotypes in var gene expression, rates of genomic recombination, and telomere maintenance. We now propose to use genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation to establish the distribution of G4 motifs and their cognate helicases throughout the P. falciparum genome. At the RNA level, we will examine the G4 content of the transcriptome via RNA base modification and structure-specific sequencing. In a second arm of experiments, we will follow up our work on the two 'RecQ' G4 helicases by making and characterising a double RecQ knockout, and also a knockout of the second class of putative G4 helicase termed FANCJ. Finally, we will characterise these knockouts not only in terms of G4-specific phenotypes, but also in their effects on DNA replication dynamics throughout the genome, using DNA fibre analysis. Together, these experiments will provide multiple lines of evidence for the presence and roles of G4s and their cognate helicases in P. falciparum, thus improving our understanding of a novel aspect of malaria biology that is highly relevant to virulence.

Given the relatively small size of the mitochondrial genome our detailed understanding of the molecular mechanism that govern mitochondrial gene maintenance and expression is still surprisingly sketchy. Defects of mtDNA and nDNA are well-recognised cause of genetic disorders that have diverse clinical manifestations ranging from progressive muscle weakness to fatal infantile disease. Much of our understanding of mitochondrial molecular genetics has come from studying rare mitochondrial disorders. Currently there are no effective treatments for these diseases and there are very few animal models for them. The slow progress in gathering more data on how mitochondrial genome is regulated is, in large part, owing to our current inability to edit mtDNA. Genome engineering techniques, analogous to the ones routinely used to modify the nuclear DNA, are not in hand, so we are unable to interrogate the role of cis-acting elements for RNA expression as well as transcription or replication. Furthermore, we are still unable to introduce pathogenic mtDNA mutations at will so their effect could be studied in animal models. In particular, the programme focuses on: (i) Studying the basic mechanisms of mitochondrial genome regulation with the main focus on the novel proteins responsible for nuclolytic processing of precursor mitochondrial RNA, polyadenylation of mitochondrial messenger RNA, post-transcriptional nucleotide modification of mitochondrial RNA and mitoribosome biogenesis. (ii) The analysis of the key aspects of mitochondrial genome regulation in samples derived from patients affected with mitochondrial disease. This analysis is a source of valuable insights into the pathomechanisms of human disease, and also into basic mitochondrial molecular genetics. Importantly. They provide patients with a molecular diagnosis for prevention (prenatal genetic diagnosis) and counselling. (iii) Developing new approaches for the genetic modification of mitochondria of living cells. The key long-term aim is to establish routine methods of genetic modification of mammalian mitochondria. Enzymatic methods are being developed to modify the mitochondrial genome e.g. engineered zinc finger nucleases are delivered to mitochondria in order to deplete cells selectively of specific mtDNA variants.

During a particular cellular process, they act by base-pairing with the 3'UTR of hundred of mRNA targets to repress their protein translation. Notably, it has been elegantly demonstrated that in Caenorhabditis elegans, the let-7 miRNA does not function to reduce gene expression noise broadly but to directs vulva development through regulation of a single target. Whether this mode of miRNA regulation also occurs in other systems, such as human, remains largely unclear. Prediction of miRNA targets, experimental validation and rescue experiments have suggested that this could be the case, but this has never been addressed systematically. Considering that a single miRNA can regulate thousands of transcripts, using this method to precisely address this question, for any single putative target, would be very time consuming. Herein, we aim to develop CRISPR-CAS9 pooled screening technologies that specifically and rapidly address this important biological question. The discovery of key targets of important miRNAs in cancer or other diseases can reveal new therapeutic targets/biomarkers. This proposed work follows from our recent study pending revision, in Nature Communication, where we discovered that two miRNAs, miR-100 and miR-125b, are induced by TGFb in advanced PDAC and are important effectors of the tumourigenic TGFb response. We developed a novel method to identify all the targets of these miRNAs, that we called RIP-USE, which indicated that these two miRNAs co-regulate hundreds of transcripts after TGFb induction, but could not identify the key targets of such miRNAs. Therefore, we now want to develop a series of CRISPR/CAS9 screening methods that would permit to identify the crucial miRNA targets. We will focus on the oncogenic miR-100 and miR125b as well the tumour suppressor miR-205 and miR-203 to develop methods that can be used to discover key miRNA targets for any miRNA of choice.

34	Dr Lee Wong	Monash University	None	2018-01-01	2019-12-31	Understanding the Role of Histone Variants in Tumorigenesis.	Chromatin regulatory framework is frequently disrupted in cancers, driving aberrant processes including transcription. Recent studies show that point mutations in histone variant H3.3 and its chaperone ATRX are initiating events in cancers including brain and bone cancers. ATRX mutations are also linked to an Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) phenotype- an aberrant telomere DNA elongation mechanism found in 15% of cancers. ATRX has been identified as a key contributor to this enigmatic process. We have recently identified H3.3 serine31 phosphorylation (H3.3S31Ph), an H3.3-specific modification that is severely disrupted in ATRX-null ALT cancers. This is the only chromatin modification that is known to distinguish ALT cancers from normal cells. This aberrant H3.3S31Ph pattern is essential for ALT cell survival. Aim: Using embryonic stem and neuroprogenitor cell models with ATRX/H3.3 mutations, we will determine the normal function of H3.3S31Ph in chromatin maintenance, and how abnormalities in this modification promotes tumorigenesis. Plan: We propose to uncover the role of H3.3S31Ph in normal and ATRX mutated cells. First, a series of ChIP sequencing experiments to identify genomic regions enriched in H3.3S31Ph and to characterise the chromatin which surrounds this modification. This will be cross-referenced against RNA sequencing data to determine how H3.3S31Ph controls gene expression. All experiments will be performed in normal cells and mutant cells genetically engineered to carry precise mutations in H3.3S31 or ATRX. Second, we will create ATRX mutants carrying additional mutations (including genes involved in chromatin assembly, DNA checkpoint, telomere protection, DNA repair) to determine the role of H3.3S31Ph in ALT activation and maintenance. Third, H3.3S31Ph modified histones will be pulled down and subjected to mass spectrometry to identify factors that bind H3.3S31Ph. These studies will define the normal function of H3.3S31Ph and reveal how disruptions in this modification contributes to the pathology of ALT tumours.

41	Dr Alper Akay	University of East Anglia	Biological Sciences	2020-01-01	2023-12-31	The function of the RNA methylome in animals	Our DNA contains the core genetic information that is inherited by our children. This genetic information programs how and when genes will be expressed within the diverse number of cells of an organism. Epigenetic mechanisms such as chromatin and DNA modifications give rise to heritable gene expression changes without affecting the DNA code. Research in epigenetics led to the discoveries of novel gene regulatory mechanisms with heritable features. A similar paradigm has now emerged with RNA. RNA carries the message encoded in the DNA. Yet this message itself can also be altered by chemical modifications. There are currently more than 150 diverse modifications found on RNA and a greater number of proteins are required for their biogenesis and recognition. Recent discoveries have shown that RNA modifications can be dynamically regulated and they have been implicated in embryonic development, longevity, neurological diseases and cancers in humans and in animal models. The heritable nature of epigenetic mechanisms requires gene expression changes within the germ cells, which give rise to the offspring. Germline development, germ cell proliferation and identity are essential for the survival of organisms. Epigenetic mechanisms play key roles in genome defence by targeting foreign elements and they also prevent somatic gene expression in the germ cells. Still, in some animals, it is possible to reprogram the epigenetic pathways to establish heritable gene expression changes that can last many generations. The biological role of most RNA modifications remains unclear in multicellular organisms and their role in heritable gene expression regulation is not explored. Research using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as an animal model made pioneering contributions to the discovery and understanding of epigenetic gene regulatory pathways in animal germlines. Up until recently, the RNA modification landscape of C. elegans was not know. In order to establish C. elegans as a model system to study the role of RNA modifications, I developed mass spectrometry methods that enable the identification and quantification of modified RNAs. Using these methods, I showed that several RNA modifications found in C. elegans show changes upon stress such as dietary restriction or high temperatures. In some instances, these changes in RNA modifications can be reversed. My research aims to uncover the role of a specific group of RNA modifications that contain a methyl group. By understanding how RNA methylations contribute to gene expression changes in germ cells, I aim to discover their epigenetic functions. Using a combination of biochemical and genetic methods, I will (i) develop an enzyme specific sequencing method for methylated RNAs (ii) study the role of RNA methylations in animal germ cells (iii) investigate how RNA methylome itself is regulated by dietary metabolism This research is important because, first the proposed sequencing method will benefit a large research community and enable the profiling of RNA methylations in multicellular organisms. Second, understanding the role of RNA modifications in germ cells will reveal their role in cell proliferation and differentiation that will benefit research in human diseases such as cancer and fertility. And finally, my research has the potential to pioneer a new research direction on how our diet can affect gene expression through RNA modifications.	Medical Research Council	Fellowship	1224902.0	GBP
42	Dr Leeanne McGurk	University of Dundee	None	2020-03-01	2022-02-28	Defining novel therapeutic targets for TDP-43-associated neurodegenerative disease.	My goal is to understand the mechanism by which the 5-methylcytosine (5mC)-RNA methyltransferases regulate TDP-43 aggregation and associated disease, as I hypothesize that understanding this pathway will lay the foundation for potential therapeutic strategies. The methylation of cytosine (C) to 5mC in RNA and the impact that this has on the cell and organism is poorly understood. It is known that the 5mC-modification in RNA is stress-induced and my preliminary data indicate that 5mC is enriched in cytoplasmic stress granules, which are membranelles organelles that sequester RNA and protein complexes. My previous studies indicate that stress granules sequester TDP-43 and with time the protein transitions into a disease-like aggregate. Thus, I hypothesize that the generation of 5mC in RNA promotes stress-granule formation providing the initial seed for TDP-43 disease-like aggregation. To test my hypothesis, I will take an interdisciplinary approach and combine the model organism Drosophila melanogaster (“the fly”) with mammalian cells and neurons together with in vitro biochemical approaches. I will elucidate if the six 5mC-RNA methyltransferases in the fly are important in the brain. To do this I will determine the 5mC-RNA methyltransferases regulates TDP-43 in the nervous system of the fly. Aiming for an understanding of the underlying mechanism I will use mammalian cells and in vitro protein preparations to determine if the 5mC-RNA methyltransferases regulate stress-induced TDP-43 aggregation and whether this is via stress-granule intermediate. These studies will launch into a research program that will investigate 5mC-RNA in greater mechanistic insight and identify therapeutic potential.

Like all viruses it critically relies on the reprogramming of the cellular metabolism and in particular on hijacking the translation machinery of its host. The goal of this proposal is to identify vulnerabilities of the virus during its usurpation of the host cell. Specifically, we will comprehensively test multiple aspects that SARS-CoV-2 may use to hijack host translation. This will be crucial to design attenuated viruses that can be used as vaccines not only for this virus but also for newly emerging zoonotic viruses in the future.Therefore, we will first, ask whether the virus hijacks the host RNA modifications machinery to modify its own RNA genome to avoid detection by the host cell innate immune defense systems. Second, we will identify the host RNA modification machinery that mediates the modification of the viral genome. Third, we will examine whether viral RNA modifications facilitate the recruitment of the host translation machinery. To this end we will use ribosome profiling and RNAseq in a high-resolution infection time course to quantitatively determine the translational response of the host cell. This will reveal how SARS-CoV-2 exploits the mRNA translation machinery of the host during its life cycle. Fourth, we will test whether the virus modulates the levels of tRNA and tRNA modifications to achieve efficient translation despite the diverging codon usage between its genome and the one of its host. Finally, we will apply the knowledge gained to develop synthetic attenuated viruses lacking RNA modifications or containing sequence elements that are difficult to translate during an infection. We will test select viruses by ribosome profiling and in infection experiments. By combining these approaches, we will identify how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with its host and in particular its translation and RNA modification machineries. This will identify drug targets & strategies to rationally design attenuated viruses that can be used for vaccine development.This proposal assembles an interdisciplinary team by joining the forces of three labs that combine expertise in diverse areas like molecular virology of coronaviruses, translation mechanisms (including that of viral RNAs) and of RNA modifications. Importantly, this will allow us to go beyond the current state of the art. In particular since this team has direct access to live virus samples and the ability to create recombinant SARS-CoV-2 for experimentation. We are confident that the combined knowledge generated on this new virus can rapidly facilitate vaccine development.Importantly, we will make our initial ribosome profiling data available immediately after its acquisition to speed up research during this ongoing crisis.

This will allow us to better understand the biological processes leading to disease development, thus enabling the development of potential therapies and cures. Identifying genes and their protein products which alter disease risk will point to potential new drug targets and allow opportunities for re-purposing of existing drugs. We will use measurements of genetic factors and potential intermediate processes like gene expression, DNA methylation and protein levels, available through long-standing collaborations with clinical colleagues. A key goal of our research is to develop methods that integrate these different data types with one another and with similar data from external sources. We will expand the data available through UK-PBC (SNP-genotypes and gene-expression profiling in 100 pre-treatment cases plus 50 controls), by adding CpG-methylation and serum proteomics, enhancing our ability to identify causal pathways in disease development/progression.This will inform disease biology, subsequent treatment response, and the extent to which it can be predicted from baseline measures.

The causative agent is named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2). There is no effective vaccine currently available for SARS-CoV-2. FDA hasapproved two anti-malaria drugs, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, for emergency use fortreatment of COVID-19. In addition, remdesivir, a nucleotide analog used for treatment of Ebolavirus disease, is now in clinical trials and clinical use for COVID-19 treatment. Understandingproperties of SARS-CoV-2 and revealing cellular components essential to its infection are criticalto development of effective therapies and vaccines in the near future.SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus. Its viral RNAs have been shown to be chemically modified.Previous studies from us and others have revealed crucial roles of viral RNA modifications in viralreplication and immune evasion. Our most recent data indicate that an RNA m5Cmethyltransferase NSUN2 plays a vital role in human coronavirus replication inside host cells. Inthis administrative supplement application we propose to apply quantitative sequencing methodsdeveloped by our CEGS to map N6-methyladenosine (m6A), 5-methylcytosine (m5C),pseudouridine (Ψ), 2’-O-methylation (Nm), N7-methylguanosine (m7G) and N1-methyladenosine(m1A) in SARS-CoV-2 RNA. We will also assign modification enzymes and test their effects onviral infection using established infection models of SARS-CoV-2. We will specifically examinedNSUN2 and its effect on viral RNA m5C methylation, and test known inhibitors for inhibition of viralinfection. We will also examine potential roles of m6A and related modifications in protecting viralRNA from host innate immune responses.	National Institutes of Health	Research Grant	388014.0	USD

Like all viruses, SARS-CoV-2 also depends crucially on the reprogramming of cellular metabolism, especially when it takes over the translation machinery of its host. The aim of this application is to identify weak points in the virus during replication in the host cell. In particular, we will extensively investigate several aspects of SARS-CoV-2 in the "occupation" of the host cell. We will then use this knowledge to design newly encoded coronavirus genomes to develop novel attenuated coronaviruses as possible live attenuated vaccines. This strategy is comprehensive and applies not only to SARS-CoV-2 but may also be used for other emerging zoonotic viruses in the future. We will first examine whether the virus has the machinery to modify the host's RNA to modify its own RNA genome takes over to avoid recognition by the cell's innate immune system. Second, we will detect and analyze the cellular machinery for modification of the host RNA that mediates the modification of the viral genome. Third, we will investigate whether viral RNA modifications facilitate the recruitment of cellular translation machinery. For this purpose, we will create ribosome profiles in the course of the infection and use RNAseq in high resolution for the quantitative determination of the translation reaction of the host cells. This will show how SARS-CoV-2 uses the cell's mRNA translation machinery during its life cycle. Fourth, we will test whether the virus changes the proportion of tRNA and tRNA modifications in order to achieve efficient translation despite the divergence in codon usage. We will finally use this knowledge to develop a number of synthetically produced, attenuated viruses which, for example, lack RNA modifications or which contain new sequence elements that are difficult to translate during infection. We will examine the generated virus constructs more closely and carry out selected viruses, for example Analyze ribosome profiling as well as in animal models. On the one hand, this defines new virus variants as attenuated vaccine candidates as well as new targets for drugs, whereby the basic principle could then also be transferred to other viruses.
