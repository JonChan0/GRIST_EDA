0	Professor Stephen Brown	MRC Mammalian Genetics Unit	None	1997-10-01	2100-12-31	Disease Model Discovery	The aim of the Disease Model Discovery programme is to generate novel mouse models of disease providing a key resource for the elucidation and characterisation of new genes and pathways involved with diverse disease systems. The programme delivers a critical underpinning to our intramural research programmes at MRC Harwell, as well as furnishing a wider platform for gene and pathway discovery for the biomedical sciences community within the UK and abroad. Currently, large-scale mutagenesis and phenotyping platforms at MRC Harwell focus on the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) pipeline for the generation and identification of mouse models. The IMPC mutagenesis and phenotyping pipeline is a key ongoing programme for the discovery of novel genes associated with both early-onset and late-onset disease phenotypes. However, there is an increasing focus on the delivery of late-onset phenotypes. Diseases associated with ageing pose an increasing social and financial burden on society and represent a vital imperative for research in the biomedical sciences. There have been considerable advances, for example through GWAS studies, in identifying putative loci and pathways involved in diseases of ageing. Nevertheless, our knowledge of the genes and pathways involved with late-onset disease is neither comprehensive nor complete. As part of MRC funding to Programme 1 over the next five years we plan to introduce over 100 genes into the IMPC pipeline encompassing both early-onset and late-onset phenotyping platforms. This effort will be supplemented by additional funding from the NIH which will enable us to feed a further ~200 genes into the IMPC pipeline for the determination of both early and late-onset phenotypes. Proposals for genes to enter late-onset phenotyping will be sought via the regular calls to the UK community for gene nominations as part of the wider IMPC effort at MRC Harwell. In line with the wider IMPC programme, all data is freely available and deposited in the IMPC database – see www.mousephenotype.org. For the future the bulk of null mutations that enter the IMPC pipeline will be generated by CRISPR/Cas9. In addition, with funding from Strategy Board, the MRC has established the new GEMM (Genome Editing Mice for Medicine) programme at MRC Harwell, utilising the CRISPR/Cas9 route to introduce additional types of alleles, such as point mutations, enabling for example investigators to introduce and analyse human point mutations. This programme underpins the high demand across the human and clinical genetics communities for access to models of rare and Mendelian disorders. Moreover, it is an important pillar in the Genomics England and Precision Medicine Initiative in the US. MRC Harwell has established a collaboration with Genomics England and it is expected that many of the mutants generated in the GEMM programme will be pivotal in the validation and analysis of loci identified through the 100,000 genomes project. In summary, Programme 1 at MGU Harwell is at the forefront of delivering mutants, disease models and data that are a critical pillar for functional genomics studies across the biomedical sciences spectrum and provide key resources for understanding the genetic bases for disease and an important tool for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

1	Professor Iain McInnes	University of Glasgow	College of Medical, Veterinary, Life Sci	2017-09-29	2021-03-28	MICA: Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Disease Biobanks in the UK (IMIDBio-UK)	Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) are phenotypically diverse, but share genetic & environmental susceptibility factors & common inflammatory mechanisms. Therapeutics of IMIDs have been revolutionised by specific biologic immune modifiers and immune receptor kinase inhibitors. Discrete responses emerging to given agents across IMIDs suggest the existence of both common and disease restricted pathways. Current immune therapies are prescribed without precision medicine principles. Incomplete response is not uncommon, depending on disease and drug and risk of serious toxicities remain problematic. Collectively these issues, combined with high costs have limited biologic use in the NHS, particularly in rarer IMIDs where disease aetiology and mechanism are not well understood. This is a key area of unmet need. We propose a systems approach to address these challenges that will rely heavily on the presence of large well characterized clinical biobanks informing across IMIDs. This will require significant new bridging infrastructures, including more robust biorepositories that link human tissue to phenotype and outcome. IMID-BIO-UK will address these challenges directly. We will unite several disease biobanks together to create a unique IMID tissue and data repository, unparalleled in scale and scope, to (1) examine disease specific and common endotype concepts across IMIDs beyond those facilitated by existing disease specific cohorts using advanced classification on multi-omic data, and by leveraging clinical cohort databases; (2) focus particularly on blood / tissue biopsy comparisons across IMIDs; (3) integrate multiomic data across tissue compartments including blood and understand the disease specific and common endotype inter-relationship across IMIDs; and (4) use such knowledge to enable rapid repositioning and stratification of therapeutics across IMIDs and enable access for POC studies.

To do this we will harness the special population structures in our population cohorts, together with the unparalleled capacity in Scotland to achieve extensive linkage to eHealth records, the creation of uniquely high dimensional phenotype datasets, and the effective multidisciplinary team. We will capitalise upon the special features of our study populations together with data from Generation Scotland, UK Biobank and collaborators to dissect trait genetic architecture and identify genetic variants associated with a broad range of quantitative traits of biomedical importance. We will develop and apply computational approaches to provide understanding of the genetic and environmental sources of biomedical trait variation together with their interactions. In order to exploit the “jackpot effect” of otherwise rare variants with increased frequencies in population isolates, we focus our research on Scottish (Orkney and Shetland) and Croatian (Vis and Korcula) cohorts, increasing both the size and power of our cohorts and the depth of their phenotyping. High kinship within our isolate populations facilitates imputation of variants into all genotyped individuals, with an increase in sample size enhancing detection power for both rare and common variants, using association and gene-based mapping methods. Biobanked samples (plasma, serum and urine) allow expansion of deep phenotyping (including proteomics, metabolomics, glycomics, urine traits), enabling more detailed exploration of the biology underlying associations. We will use these rich intermediate phenotype and other data to identify pathways from the genome and epigenome, through the proteome and metabolome, and to assess their impact on human health and disease using multivariate genome-wide association studies (GWAS), phenomics, two-sample Mendelian Randomisation and other integrative approaches. We also continue to functionally characterise a number of the associations, taking findings further along the translational pathway and illuminating mechanisms. The programme will contribute to our understanding of the relationships between genetic variation, gene function and health, integrates computational and experimental approaches and strengthens population cohorts towards development of precision medicine. This research programme will complement resources such as UK Biobank, which do not focus on related individuals and have limited molecular phenotyping, identifying low frequency variants and familial environmental contributions that are opaque to such studies, and leveraging the multi-omics data to suggest causality and mechanisms through, e.g. MR approaches. In the near future as long-read DNA sequencing becomes sufficiently affordable and many thousands of proteins can be assayed inexpensively, our resources will be ideal for exploring the role of novel genomic variation and further characterisation of the protein architecture of disease.

7	Professor Lucy Wedderburn	University College London	Institute of Child Health	2014-08-18	2019-06-30	MICA: Childhood Arthritis Response to Treatment consortium - partnership to define stratified medicine tools for childhood inflammatory arthritis	The primary goal of this partnership is to create the Childhood Arthritis Response to Treatment consortium (CHART), which aims to improve directly the clinical care of children with Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), by bringing together the major ongoing UK studies of JIA treatment response, and includes patients/families affected by JIA, as well as clinicians and researchers from across the UK, in order to develop a robust platform that will enable a stratified approach to treatment interventions in JIA. Predictors of response to medication to inform treatment stratification are much needed in JIA. Unopposed joint inflammation in non-responsive patients is associated with increased disability, and creates personal / economic burden for many years into adult life. Currently no validated biomarkers exist that can identify children who will fail to respond, or whose disease is resistant to either methotrexate or biologic agents. CHART will bring together existing large JIA cohort studies, key stakeholders (scientists, clinicians, patients and families), and their collaborative infrastructure and networks, to work together. The specific objectives of the CHART consortium, during this partnership are to: 1. Evaluate the clinical data and sample protocols in the currently available JIA cohort studies 2. Collate and align the data available within a common platform 3. Define and agree standardised 'core' clinical dataset, response outcome measures, sample protocols and IT for going forward 4. Expand and extend the existing cohorts by inclusion of cases from existing and new centres, using the agreed common standardised core data set and protocols The creation of the Consortium, generation of the large combined JIA dataset in a single platform, and agreement of harmonised data and sample collection protocols, will ensure that the Consortium is ideally placed to obtain future funding to achieve our longterm goals of stratified medicine for JIA.

8	Dr Amanda Swain	Institute of Cancer Research	None	2019-03-18	2022-03-17	Preclinical genetic modelling of advanced prostate cancer in response to therapy	Advanced metastatic prostate cancer is a major therapeutic challenge and is frequently lethal. Precision medicine therapies that target specific pathways are being developed, such as the anti androgens, abiraterone and enzalutamide, and PARP inhibitors, which affect tumours with BRCA1/2 mutations. Few clinically relevant models exist of advanced prostate cancer, particularly for tumours that have undergone targeted therapies. To understand the functional effect of genetic aberrations found in advanced disease on cancer progression, therapy response and mechanisms of resistance we aim to develop a series of genetically modified models for rapid analysis. We will use 3D mouse prostate organoids to generate multiple genetic changes that are specific to advanced prostate cancer using lentiviral constructs and CRISPR/CAS9 technology. Our objectives are: - To develop a work flow to perform genetic modifications found in advance prostate cancer in mouse prostate organoids. - To study the effect of genetic modifications on tumour progression and drug response in 3D cultures, including combination therapies. - To implant genetic 3D models into mice for in vivo phenotypic validation and to assess the effect of drug therapies including immunotherapies. The focus of the project will be on aberrations in genes associated with DNA repair and their sensitivity and resistance to platinum based drugs and PARP inhibitors. This pathway has been linked to advanced prostate cancer and ongoing PARP inhibitor clinical trials show response in some patients. We will model these tumours by generating prostate organoids with clinically relevant mutations in DNA repair genes. Our goal is to identify which aberrations drive tumour progression and respond to PARP inhibitors and to study mechanisms of resistance and identify therapies to overcome them. The ultimate aim is to generate information that will aid patient selection for targeted treatments and help develop more effective therapies involving this pathway.

The cause of the underlying pathology is poorly understood and there is no proven treatment. A limitation in human SVD research is that current MRI brain imaging technology has millimetre resolution while the vessels where SVD start are microscopic. However, retinal and cerebral microvasculature are developmentally related, and the former can be fully resolved in routinely acquired optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) retinal imaging. In this project, we will use Data Science to deeply phenotype retinal images in two ongoing clinical SVD studies. First, we will develop convolutional neural network approaches for OCTA image segmentation and Graph Theory approaches for structural phenotyping. Second, we will use computational fluid dynamics and high performance computing to carry out haemodynamic characterisation of the retinal vascular networks beyond what is observable clinically. Finally, we will uncover associations between structural and functional retinal phenotypes and SVD-related compromised brain haemodynamics. We expect this work to be an important step towards delivering Precision Medicine for SVD.	British Heart Foundation	Special Project	66000.0	GBP
10	Professor Daniel Hochhauser	University College London	None	2016-11-01	2021-10-31	A national post-mortem tissue collection protocol - the PEACE (Posthumous tissuE donAtion in CancEr) study	Background: The study of tumour evolution, immune-surveillance, metastatic disease and therapeutic resistance is essential for the development of precision medicine. Thus far this has generally been supported by access to tissue and blood samples, surplus to diagnostics requirements, which have been donated by living patients. However, the general lack of sufficient primary and metastatic tumour samples has often restricted cancer research to either established tumour cell lines or archival material. Aims: The aim of the centre accelerator award is to fund the infrastructure required to facilitate the collection of post-mortem tissue in patients with known metastatic cancer or primary brain tumours across several UK sites, establishing a national post-mortem tissue collection protocol. This will be based on the PEACE (Posthumous tissuE donAtion in CancEr) (REC 13/L0/0972, UCLH R&D 13/0165, UKCRN 18422) study, which is a multi-centre prospective observational study involving the collection of both tumour and normal tissue at post-mortem, blood samples for germ line DNA, circulating free DNA (cfDNA) and circulating tumour cells (CTCs). Methods: Patients with solid tumour types eligible for the study will be consented when alive, at which point blood samples will be collected. A post-mortem will be performed within 48hrs after death guided by prior imaging and post-mortem findings. Sampling will entail the excision of small amounts of tumour and normal tissue from each site of disease for snap freezing as fresh tissue as well as histopathological assessment. Where possible, multiple tumour regions will be collected. Clinical data will be collected and samples tracked using databases created by the CRUK and UCL Cancer Trials Centre. How the results of this research will be used: A study governance board will review both internal and external applications for the use of collected tissue and blood supported by independant funding. The aim is to link in with existing CRUK and non-CRUK funded studies, as well as national sequencing initiatives. Having created an unprecendented resource of tissue from highly annotated patient cohorts, this award will enable future research investigating various projects such as those investigating intratumour heterogeneity, polygenic and convergent mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies, tumour immunological landscape and neo-antigenic repertoire, the origins and evolution of metastatic subclones, tumour organoid models that efficiently represent the genetic diversity of late stage disease, and the use of cfDNA and CTCs in the context of metastatic cancer and primary brain tumours.

11	Professor Ewan Pearson	University of Dundee	Population Health and Genomics	2020-04-01	2023-03-31	Precision medicine in diabetes: Pharmacogenetic studies of large randomised controlled trials of diabetes therapies	There are now many treatment options in type 2 diabetes, with an increasing trend to using newer agents earlier due to their added cardiovascular benefit. This will greatly increase treatment costs, yet we know that some drugs are ineffective or cause adverse effects in some patients. We have established that glycaemic response to metformin is moderately heritable and it is likely that other response traits to other diabetes drugs are also heritable. We now propose that understanding this genetic variation will provide insights into drug mechanisms and the potential to select patient groups who will benefit most to specific treatment options. To date, pharmacogenomics in diabetes has been limited to older drugs and to observational data. We have published the first metformin GWAS on just 1000 patients. In the present proposal we have assembled over 30,000 patients from randomised trials of the newer diabetes drugs (SGLT2i, GLP1RA and DPP4i) with completed genome-wide data. Both SGLT2i and GLP1RA have shown reduction in cardiovascular (CV) risk, yet the mechanism for this remains uncertain. We propose to use genomic data for SGLT2i, GLP-1RA and DPP4i to: 1) run GWAS of 9 response traits (endophenotypes), 5 safety outcomes and 5 CV outcomes. 2) To use partitioned polygenic scores of diabetes risk to investigate what genetically defined aetiological processes alter response to these drugs. 3) To investigate tissue site of action using PrediXcan and pathways associated with response traits from Aim 1. 4) To investigate shared genetic aetiology between response endophenotypes and CV outcomes within and between different drugs using bivariate GREML, and to investigate causal associations between endophenotypes and CV and renal outcome. The identification of genetic variants that predict response and outcomes with SGLT2i, DPP-4i and GLP-1RA drugs will provide a major advance in personalized treatments for diabetes.

12	Dr Jonathan Daniel Rohrer	University College London	Institute of Neurology	2020-03-01	2023-02-28	JPND - Defining measures of proximity to symptom onset in the GENetic Frontotemporal dementia Initiative	Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a highly heritable neurodegenerative disorder with the majority of that heritability accounted for by autosomal dominant mutations in three genes: progranulin (GRN), microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) and chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72). The Genetic FTD Initiative (GENFI) is a European and Canadian multicentre natural history study of genetic FTD with detailed phenotyping of both presymptomatic and symptomatic mutation carriers. With trials imminent, it will be critically important to identify biomarkers of proximity to symptom onset, identifying on an individual basis those who are likely to progress to clinical FTD over the next 5 to 10 years. The aim of this study is therefore to characterize the prodromal period of genetic FTD, establishing cognitive, imaging and fluid biomarker measures that allow i) stratification of individual presymptomatic carriers into a stage proximal to symptom onset, and ii) measurement of subsequent disease progression during that proximal period. In particular, the work will extend the results found on a group basis in the prior GENFI studies to identify measures and patterns of change on an individual basis, thus paving the way for a precision medicine approach to FTD. It will make use of data from at least 950 participants already in the current GENFI studies with biomarker data acquired longitudinally (>2000 visits so far). It will focus on those likely to be in proximity to symptom onset, following 500 participants over time, with cognitive, neuroimaging, and fluid biomarker assessment as well as genomic, proteomic and transcriptomic profiling of participants. Integration of these approaches will allow stratification of genetic FTD, delineating an individualized disease profile that identifies those in proximity to symptom onset and their subsequent progression.

13	Professor Sylvia Richardson	University of Cambridge	None	2016-12-01	2023-03-31	Statistical Genomics and the Analysis of High Dimensional Data	Motivated by important biomedical collaborations, the broad aim of this programme is to enrich the statistical toolkit that is commonly used in genomics analyses by developing and implementing new analytical strategies for integrative and translational `omics’ as well as for the analysis of single cell data. The core of the proposed models and inference will be embedded within state of the art statistical developments in Bayesian modelling and computations, although analogous penalised approaches will also be investigated and compared to Bayesian implementations. We will focus on modelling and computational strategies where the multidimensional (e.g. complex multiple-phenotype) and multivariate aspects (many explanatory features) of complex data sets are investigated and exploited at key steps of the analysis strategy. The analysis of complex `omics’ phenotypes will be investigated through the extension of sparse regression approaches to large number of responses, as well as by the use of graphical modelling approaches, which target estimation of the network structure and direct associations between the omics features of interest. Both approaches deal with the large p (large number of features) small n (number of samples) context by using sparse formulations or shrinkage. One important focus will be to use context specific (e.g. clinical, epidemiological or biological) information to build hierarchical relationships between different sources of data and informative priors based on substantive knowledge. Model uncertainty will be taken into account as part of the Bayesian modelling process. In complement, a programme of work tackling stratification in precision medicine will be developed. The approach chosen is focussed on formulating semi supervised (outcome guided) integrative clustering models and algorithms to uncover subpopulations of patients that have diagnostic, prognostic or theranostic meaning, using a collection of high dimensional biomarkers We will use the methods to search for new associations and structures in a range of exemplar case studies demonstrating multiple facets of the applicability of the novel methods that will be developed. In particular, we will investigate gene expression profiling and eQTLs for autoimmune diseases, integrative clustering for subtyping breast cancer in link with survival, and integrative genomics of cardiovascular diseases. Scalability of the algorithms developed will be a focus of attention. The computer programmes implemented will be open source and made publicly available.	Medical Research Council	Unit	None	None

16	Professor Siobhan Quenby	University of Warwick	Warwick Medical School	2017-09-29	2021-03-28	Tommy's Reproductive Health Biobank	The Tommy's Reproductive Health Biobank aims to facilitate researchers in reproductive health to move the field from one of excellent science and excellent pragmatic trials to a precision medicine focused field, where women at high risk of complications can be given appropriate care and new effective interventions can be developed. Tommy's four centres of excellence include research teams from Edinburgh, Manchester, King College London, Imperial, Birmingham and Warwick who all have the ability to obtain detailed mechanistic information from tissue samples using techniques including sequencing of DNA, RNA in whole tissues, RNA sequencing in single cells, DNA methylation gene reads, and proteomics. Clinical phenotyping in-terms of past history and importantly future pregnancy, neonatal and infant outcomes is needed to facilitate translation of this scientific excellence to patient benefit. Across the four Tommy's centres, a wide-ranging variety of samples are/will be collected including pre-conceptual endometrium, sperm, serum, plasma, serial samples in high and low risk pregnancy of plasma, serum, vaginal, dental microbiome, then at delivery adipose tissue, myometrium, placenta, membranes, cord blood, and after delivery neonatal brain. Currently these tissues are stored in six separate biobanks, all striving to achieve the same ideal situation. By combing these six into one virtual entity, it will allow us to ensure 1) quality and consistency of sampling and outcome ascertainment through unified SOPs for sample collection, 2) processing and tracking, 3) working with software engineers to link relevant clinical data and the development of a searchable database. The resulting biobank will have details of large numbers of women with diverse pregnancy problems, with high quality data collection and outcome follow up. This will ensure that samples are of maximum benefit to Tommy's researchers, as well as for others in the field and the wider research community.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	1156059.0	GBP
17	Professor Richard Marais	University of Manchester	None	2016-07-01	2021-06-30	Molecular Oncology Group	Background: Over the last 10 years, our Group has made important contributions to our understanding of the fundamental processes underlying melanoma development and progression. Our studies have had significant impact on melanoma patient care. We have developed tractable models of melanoma that have allowed us to study gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. With our move to Manchester, we have established excellent connections to clinical colleagues at the Christie NHS Foundation Trust, and developed a translational programme that aims to inform patient stratification and the clinical management of melanoma and other cancers. Aims: Our aims are: • To investigate how ultraviolet light drives melanoma development. • To develop new treatments for uveal melanoma. • To develop new drugs for melanoma and other cancers. • To develop new treatments for prostate cancer. • To develop a precision medicine platform for melanoma and other cancers. Methods: Underpinning all of our studies are the models of disease we have developed and refined over the past ten years, including genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) and patient-derived models (cell lines, PDX, CDX) models. We have extensive expertise in next generation sequencing (NGS) approaches and functional analysis of cancer biology. We will use our GEMMs to dissect the gene-gene and gene-environment interactions on melanoma development and progression, and to study responses to immunotherapies to guide optimisation of these drugs in the clinic. We will develop and study GEMMs of uveal melanoma and prostate cancer, which, coupled with analysis of patient samples, will allow us to identify novel targets and develop or optimise much-needed new therapeutic approaches for these cancers. Using patient-derived models, we will identify new therapeutic targets for melanoma and other cancers, and investigate mechanisms of resistance, allowing us to develop precision medicine approaches for melanoma and other cancers, and to develop new anti-cancer drugs. Impact: Our philosophy is that patient care should be based on improved knowledge of cancer biology. Our overarching aim is to understand the processes of cancer to develop better approaches to prevention, to develop new drugs, and to improve the clinical management of cancer patients.

In on-going studies to explore the basis of variability in the human population of patients’ platelets to activators, inhibitors and anti-platelet drugs, we have developed a new multi-parameter analytical system incorporating machine learning techniques to characterise platelet function in depth and have compelling evidence that this may be used to stratify cardiovascular disease patients. In this study we will incorporate analysis of platelets from patients that have previously suffered a thrombotic event, to determine the ability of this system to be used diagnostically, and to predict likely efficacy to specific anti-platelet medication. This, and studies to understand the basis of phenotypic differences between patients will allow us to evaluate the potential use of this system for precision medicine approaches to improve patient outcomes through targeted use of existing drugs and clinical testing of new anti-platelet medication.

19	Dr Laura Shallcross	University College London	None	2017-02-01	2022-01-31	Precision antibiotic prescribing for urinary tract infection in hospital	Many infections do not need to be treated with antibiotics, yet doctors still prescribe antibiotics for patients who are unlikely to need them. This causes antibiotic resistance, and it makes antibiotics that we rely on for many medical treatments potentially useless. My goal is to use "big data" to make it easier for doctors to work out which patients really need an antibiotic and which antibiotics to prescribe. This will benefit patients by reducing the number of people who get side effects from unnecessary antibiotics. It will also benefit society by reducing antibiotic resistance. To test whether my approach works, I am focusing on patients with urinary tract infection (UTI). This is a common reason for patients to be admitted to hospital. Most patients in hospital with possible UTI are treated with antibiotics, but many do not need them because UTI is actually frequently mis-diagnosed. My first step is to analyse detailed computerised medical records from more than 9000 patients with possible urinary tract infection at University Hospital Birmingham (UHB). I am using data from Birmingham hospital because they have very detailed and high quality electronic medical records. I will learn about what happens to patients with possible urinary tract infection in hospital and estimate how often antibiotics are prescribed when they are not needed. Next I will develop computer simulations to predict who really needs an antibiotic when they come into hospital, and which antibiotic to choose. Because we don't know the best way to create this model I will use two different approaches side-by-side: a conventional approach (statistics) and a new approach (machine learning). I will then compare the two approaches. Machine learning lets the computer identify patterns in the data to make predictions and this means it can be really useful for complicated datasets like electronic medical records. In the NHS we are moving towards "personalised medicine" where patients can receive tailor-made treatments that are based not only on their medical history but also on their genes. This can be done by collecting genetic measurements, like DNA from patient blood samples. Incorporating these genetic measurements could improve my risk prediction models. To test this idea, I will collect blood samples from 300 patients with possible urinary tract infection and look for gene “signatures” or patterns that help identify which patients need antibiotics. Patients with bacterial infection that needs antibiotic treatment would be expected to “express” (or activate) different genes to patients without bacterial infection. So this could provide a potential means to identify patients who do not require antibiotics. For patients who do not have a bacterial infection antibiotic treatment does more harm than good. However, doctors are understandably reluctant to delay antibiotic treatment in the emergency department, in case they fail to treat a sick patient. An alternative approach is to stop antibiotics as soon as possible after they have been started in patients who do not need them. Provided my research can identify patients who are unlikely to need antibiotics, I will test whether patients and doctors think it is safe and acceptable to stop antibiotics early in these patients. To design this “feasibility” study I will work with a group of patients and healthcare staff. Patients who have been started on antibiotics (but are unlikely to need them) will be selected by chance to either a) stop or to b) continue antibiotics. We will then measure what happens to all of these patients over the following 48 hours in hospital. If there is no difference between the two groups it means that it is likely to be safe to stop antibiotics early. If this is the case, we will apply for more research funding to test this approach in a large clinical trial. This work will develop new ways to diagnose infection and to reduce antibiotic resistance. This will help to preserve our existing and future antibiotics benefitting or patients and society.

In 400 severe asthma patients, we will determine phenotype according to the biomarker/biomarker signatures obtained from U-BIOPRED (Unbiased Biomarkers for the Prediction of Respiratory Diseases Outcomes) cohort and expression of mechanistic pathways over 3 visits over one year. We will collect blood, exhaled breath condensate and sputum samples for multi-omics platforms, and in Korea, bronchial brushings. We will define the trajectory of molecular phenotypes and pathways using the transcriptomic-associated clusters in sputum transcriptome, and gene set variation analysis. In those receiving T2-targeted biologic therapies, we will find the best molecular signatures that predicting response to individual therapies. We will use model-based mixture models, or hierarchical/k-means clustering and trajectory classification to define phenotypic clusters grouping together patients sharing similar clinical traits.

The commensal bacterium Neisseria lactamica (Nlac) does not have a polysaccharide capsule , so any adaptive immune response to this bacterium after colonisation of the nasopharynx must be directed at non-capsular antigens, providing a good platform for assessing non-anti-polysaccharide immunity against colonising bacteria in the upper respiratory tract. A wild-type strain of Nlac Y92-1009 (Nlac), will be chromosomally modified to express the strongly immunogenic meningococcal antigen PorA (GM-Nlac). GM-Nlac will be fully characterised, in particular with respect to enhanced antimicrobial or serum resistance, and altered genome stability cf Nlac. An application will then be made to DEFRA and the National Research Ethics Service to perform a controlled infection study in which non-smoking male participants aged 18-45 will be infected intranasally at a dose of 10,000 colony forming units (selected because we previously have infected >350 volunteers with Nlac at this dose) and then permitted to re-enter the community after challenge and followed up for 4 weeks. In a comprehensive serological and cellular immunological study we will define the nature and kinetics of the PorA-specific immune response to colonising GM-Nlac and measure recombination in carried isolates over the ensuing period of carriage. PorA is phase variable so we will determine the effect of phase variation in a second challenge experiment by comparing the serological and cellular responses to GM-Nlac expressing PorA under a phase variable promoter with one that is constitutively highly expressed. We will also compare the immune response to Nlac antigens between GM-Nlac and Nlac infected participants, to understand the effect of immunodominant antigens on immunity.

29	Dr James Ware	MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences	None	2015-10-01	2021-03-31	Cardiovascular Genomics and Precision Medicine	The group’s overarching research aims are to understand the impact of genetic variation on the heart and circulation, and to use genome information to improve patient care. Several research themes contribute to these aims: Gene discovery in rare cardiovascular disease – we are using exome and genome sequencing approaches in humans to find genes that cause rare Mendelian disease, particularly severe childhood cardiomyopathies (heart muscle diseases), both to provide answers to the families affected, and also to find new therapeutic targets for the treatment of these conditions. Having identified candidate disease genes through sequencing in humans, we are using genome engineering in stem-cell derived cardiomyocytes to further characterise the role of these genes in the heart, to determine mechanisms of pathogenicity, and to identify targets for therapeutic modulation. Variant interpretation – all of us carry rare variants that alter important genes. Distinguishing between those that cause disease and those that are innocent bystanders is a key challenge in contemporary clinical genetics. We are developing and applying new methods to address this challenge, and collaborating globally to refine our understanding of variation in genes associated with heart disease. We are aggregating large cohorts of subjects with inherited cardiac conditions (mainly cardiomyopathies) and reference samples both locally and through collaboration (e.g. the NIHR Royal Brompton Cardiovascular BRU BioBank, the Exome Aggregation Consortium, the Clinical Genome Resource, Genomics England, Oxford Molecular Genetics Laboratory, Laboratory for Molecular Medicine at Partners Healthcare, the SHaRe Cardiomyopathy Registry, the NIHR Rare Diseases Translational Research Collaboration) to develop and evaluate new computational methods. Precision medicine – we are evaluating the use of genetics and biomarkers to stratify patients and predict their response to therapy and long-term outcomes. Ultimately, we are working to interpret genome information so that it can be used to optimise treatment choice for our patients. We are particularly focusing on genetic stratification of cohorts with hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies. We integrate genetics, biomarkers, and precision phenotyping with electronic medical records and clinical outcome data to identify determinants of prognosis and treatment response. Titin – we have a particular focus on the Titin gene, which encodes the largest human protein, a key component of muscles throughout the body. Recently identified as the most important cause of inherited dilated cardiomyopathy, we are working to understand the effects of Titin variants on the heart, their mechanisms of action, and their clinical significance. Our group focuses on computational approaches and statistical genetics in human subjects, and we integrate these data with genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and physiological data from model organisms and cellular models through collaboration within and without the MRC Clinical Sciences Centre.

(http://www.cancercentre.ox.ac.uk) The vision of the Centre spans the research spectrum – from fundamental sciences through the translational pipeline and into clinical care with outputs feeding back into a cycle of discovery. To deliver this vision, we have focused our activity in key themes with our investments emphasising support for translational activity. We seek to partner with other funding bodies to continue to develop our fundamental sciences and deliver our clinical trials portfolio. We also pursue collaborative opportunities with other institutions across the UK and internationally to support our research objectives. As a CRUK-funded Centre we are committed to complimenting the priorities of CRUK’s new research strategy; looking for new opportunities to support their vision to beat cancer sooner. Research Strategy The Centre focuses on its strengths in radiotherapy and early phase trials in small cohorts of molecularly stratified patients, seeking novel combinations of treatments and utilisation of cutting edge technologies. We are expanding the definition of ‘personalisation of treatment’: interlinking specific molecular and genetic patient data with functional imaging to select the most effective experimental combination of surgical, radiotherapy and systemic interventions. We are committed to delivering this vision of precision medicine, through the Precision Cancer Medicine Institute (PCMI). To achieve this bold ambition we must draw from the broad range of expertise Oxford provides; from mathematicians to surgeons, chemists to epidemiologists, biologists to medical oncologists. We will work with scientists and clinicians from a variety of disciplines and not allow traditional boundaries to prevent new collaborations. We also foster networking in the Centre creating an ongoing dialogue across our wide ranging membership, leading to collaborations with help research realise its clinical impact. Scientific Areas of Interest Our disease sites of interest reflect the breadth and depth of activity here in Oxford. We have well established programmes in breast, melanoma, colorectal, urological, sarcoma, ovarian and blood cancers, where our work integrates internal research activity from across a range of disciplines to engage or lead in national and international networks. We aim to further expand our programmes in oesophageal, pancreas, brain and lung cancers through further investment in recruitment, support of our strategic working groups and engagement with national research networks. We see these as critical areas of focus for the future; to apply our world leading research to areas which can have significant impact for patients and to support CRUK’s ambition of addressing areas of unmet need. We are also expanding our scientific focus to include emerging areas of interest including tumour immunology, clinical informatics and proton beam therapy. Other Areas of Activity We invest in underpinning platforms of support which span the breadth of our cancer research community. Schemes such as the Development Fund, our networking events and working groups, and the Centre’s Annual Symposium provide the springboard for new ideas and innovations to be launched. All members across the Centre have access to these activities, which offer the opportunity for new connections, deeper collaborations and research innovation. We also foster a culture of engagement to enable Oxford’s science and CRUK’s investment to reach a wider audience. We believe that inspiring people with our research can bring hope that beating cancer is within reach. Finally, our training programme for the Centre’s clinical and non-clinical students takes full advantage of the enriched training environment that Oxford provides and enables us to recruit the best trainees, who we hope will go on to become our future leaders. For the future, we aim to continue to raising Oxford’s national and international reputation for cancer research; driving the research agenda and delivering world-class research which will be of benefit to patients.

33	Professor Dame Anna Dominiczak	University of Glasgow	College of Medical, Veterinary, Life Sci	2015-02-01	2016-10-31	Construction of an Imaging Centre of Excellence (ICE) at the new South Glasgow University Hospital	The synergy between imaging and genomics technologies has been recognised by the Technology Strategy Board as being an important driver to the future development of Stratified or Precision Medicine. The benefits of stratified medicine are now globally recognised, and Scotland is uniquely placed to capitalise on this potential, owing to its strong academic research base, advanced electronic health records within the NHS, and a strong industry presence in genomics, bioinformatics and diagnostics. The University of Glasgow led the development of the Scotland-wide £20M Stratified Medicine Scotland Innovation Centre (SMS-IC), which will also based at the South Glasgow University Hospital campus. The focus of SMS-IC is on bringing together genome sequencing technology and the complex bioinformatics required to link genomic data with NHS clinical data to allow stratification of patients based on genetic profiles. The co-location of ICE and SMS-IC will therefore provide significant added value to both centres. By linking clinical academics, NHS and industry together, the Imaging Centre of Excellence (ICE) will maximise and facilitate the economic impact from the clinical research excellence at the new South Glasgow University Hospital, and ensure the hospital site becomes a UK exemplar of a Life Sciences cluster. As such, the proposal fully aligns with the Scottish Life Sciences Strategy and the facility would add significant value to existing assets in Scotland.

36	Dr Robert Falconer	University of Bradford	None	2019-01-07	2021-07-06	Development of a novel, targeted cytotoxic treatment for breast cancer	Despite advances in detection and adjuvant therapies, treatment of metastatic breast cancer (mBC) remains palliative, claiming the lives of 500,000 women worldwide each year, emphasising the magnitude of the unmet clinical need. While targeted therapies exist for individual patient subtypes, cytotoxic chemotherapy remains important for all subgroups. The success of chemotherapy is limited by drug resistance and toxicities. The duocarmycins are ultrapotent cytotoxins, which evade multidrug resistance and DNA repair mechanisms, but proved too toxic for human use. Targeted delivery of duocarmycins has the potential to increase therapeutic index. Aims We will apply the principles of precision medicine to the delivery of a novel, dual-targeted duocarmycin cytotoxic prodrug activated by tumour membrane-type matrix metalloproteinases, and demonstrate pre-clinical proof-of-concept to underpin early clinical trials in women with mBC. Techniques and Methodology We will employ an iterative approach to compound synthesis, informed by detailed LC-MS-based ex vivo metabolism studies developed in our laboratory. These assays will assess prodrug activation in tumour tissues and stability in normal tissues (plasma, liver, kidney, lung) at the bench, and will predict in vivo pharmacokinetics. Two prodrugs will be identified for in vivo evaluation of the maximum-tolerated dose and pharmacokinetics, prior to selecting one candidate for efficacy studies in relevant murine models. Impact on breast cancer research If successful this will be a first-in-class, novel potential therapeutic, and provide a rationale for a clinical trial. This project has significant potential to improve the quantity and quality of life for countless mBC patients, regardless of molecular subtype.	Breast Cancer Now	Project	None	None
37	Professor Martin Landray	University of Oxford	None	2019-02-01	2019-11-30	ISCF HDRUK DIH Sprint Exemplar: Using Routine NHS Data to Accelerate Clinical Trial Recruitment	This project will deliver a secure, web-based service that uses data assets managed by NHS Digital to facilitate recruitment into large clinical trials and other research projects. There will be two components: a) A metadata catalogue to facilitate use of HES data adapted from the NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre catalogue toolkit. This will support annotation and computable representation of source data, trial eligibility criteria, and data extraction requests. b) A web-enabled system to facilitate clinical trial recruitment based on the NWEH FARSITE system originally designed for primary care. This will allow authorised users to configure eligibility selection criteria (e.g. age-range, diagnosis), filter search results (e.g. by hospital), and generate lists of eligible individuals. The work will be co-designed by experts in clinical trial design, data engineering, information governance, and NHS Digital systems and data assets. The work will be evaluated using contemporary and hypothetical trial protocols, and demonstrated to potential users, including industry representatives. The project is time-limited but will inform the design and implementation of future systems to facilitate data-enabled clinical trials, prospective cohorts, and precision medicine studies. It will also provide an important component for an upgraded NIHR Health Data Finder.	Medical Research Council	P&Cs	294037.0	GBP
38	Martin Jinek	University of Zurich	Biochemisches Institut Universität Zürich	2018-01-10	2022-09-30	Molecular mechanisms of CRISPR-associated genome editor nucleases	Over the last five years, RNA-guided endonucleases originating from prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas systems have emerged as powerful and versatile molecular tools for precision genome editing applications in basic research, biotechnology and molecular medicine. The nucleases Cas9 and Cas12a (Cpf1) can be readily programmed using short RNA molecules to generate targeted double-strand DNA breaks in the genome, whose subsequent repair is then exploited to engineer genetic modifications. Despite extensive studies, several aspects of the molecular mechanisms of Cas9 and Cas12a, such as initial target DNA binding and final DNA cleavage, are not fully understood. At the same time, CRISPR-Cas genome editing suffers from limitations such as off-target activity, necessitating on-going technological development to improve the specificity of genome editor nucleases for gene therapeutic applications.Building on our pioneering work in the field, the proposed research will examine the molecular interactions underpinning the activities of Cas9 and Cas12a nucleases, specifically aiming to (i) dissect the mechanisms of Cas9- mediated DNA binding and catalytic activation in Cas9, (ii) determine the structural basis of Cas9âs off-target activity, and (iii) elucidate the DNA cleavage mechanism of Cas12a. To address key steps in the molecular mechanism of Cas9, X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy will be used to determine the structures of Cas9 bound to a partially unwound DNA target and an activated-state Cas9-DNA complex trapped using engineered disulphide cross- links. Off-target activity of Cas9 will be investigated by determining a series of crystal structures of Cas9 bound to bona fide off-target DNAs in order to systematically document off-target interactions such as single-nucleotide mismatches and bulges tolerated by the nuclease. The resulting structural insights will be used to derive a comprehensive off- targeting model with improved predictive power that will subsequently be validated using DNA binding and cleavage assays in vitro and genome editing experiments in vivo. Biochemical investigations of Cas12a will initially define the order and interdependence of strand cleavage events in the canonical cis-cleavage mechanism acting on double-stranded DNA substrates. In turn, X-ray crystallographic analysis of Cas12a in complex with a crRNA guide and a single- stranded DNA target will reveal the conformational activation mechanism responsible for its recently described trans- cleavage activity. Together, these studies will pave the way for subsequent investigations of the catalytic mechanism of target DNA cleavage using time-resolved crystallography.Taking a multidisciplinary approach combining structural studies with biochemical, biophysical and genome editing experiments, the proposed studies will shed light on critical steps in the molecular mechanisms of Cas9 and Cas12a. In doing so, they will not only advance our understanding of their functions but will also provide a mechanistic framework for future structure-guided engineering of these enzymes to improve their efficiency and specificity. In particular, structural analysis of Cas9 off-target activity will be pivotal for developing new off-target prediction and diagnostic tools, as well as engineered high-fidelity Cas9 variants to address the safety of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in genetic and cellular therapies. Taken together, the proposed research will make a substantial impact on the CRISPR field and a timely contribution to harnessing the potential of CRISPR-Cas genome editing for medical applications.

39	Dr Robert Jones	University of Glasgow	None	2015-08-01	2017-07-31	A clinical research fellowship in cancer clinical trials	Background. Clinical research in cancer in general, and clinical trials research in particular, is essential for the translation of new scientific findings into clinical practice. Whilst clinical research remains part of the day-to-day activity of many practising oncologists, there is a need for a cadre of highly trained clinical trials research specialists to lead the development of clinical trials in the future. Aims. To provide an opportunity for a highly able cancer physician in training to become a clinical trials research specialist. To enable delivery of umbrella precision-medicine phase II trials in urothelial and pancreatic cancers. Methods. The fellow will spend 2 years working in the CRUK Glasgow Clinical Trials Unit learning the skills involved in clinical trial initiation, design, delivery, analysis and publication. This will be achieved by working across a small portfolio of trials with the common theme of employing precision medicine to deliver new therapeutic concepts to improve outcomes for patients with cancer. By cross-portfolio working, the fellow will gain experience at all stages in clinical trial development. In addition, the fellow will develop a number of studies exploring aspects of delivery of precision medicine trials in these groups of patients. How the results will be used. Although the fellow will be engaged in project work around specific clinical trials, it is not the intention of this specific fellowship award to generate final trial results. Moreover, the primary output of this project will be the successful training of a high-calibre clinical trials specialist. This individual will go on to become a leading chief investigator in their own area of cancer research and practice and will ultimately become a leader of clinical cancer research.

40	Dr Manju Kurian	University College London	None	2017-12-01	2022-11-30	Understanding Genetic Causes of Cerebral Palsy: A Patient-Centric Approach to Improve Diagnosis and Develop New Treatments	BackgroundCerebral palsy (CP) is an early-onset life-long motor disorder occurring in the developing fetal or infant brain. It is one of the most commonly encountered neurological disorders of childhood, with an estimated UK incidence of 2.5/1000. A number of different motor patterns are described in CP, including spastic, hemiplegic, dystonic, dyskinetic, ataxic and hypotonic forms. CP is commonly associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The rising economic burden of CP is of significant global medical and socioeconomic concern. CP has been traditionally attributed to acquired brain injury and recognised risk factors include birth asphyxia, prematurity and low birth weight. Over time, it has become apparent that acquired injury accounts for only a proportion of patients with CP. In the current genomic era, an underlying genetic aetiology is identified in a significant number of children labelled as having CP. Indeed, in my pilot study of 95 cases, I established a genetic aetiology in 49 children, just over 50% of the cohort. For certain neurogenetic disorders, I have been able to instigate a personalized medicine approach leading to striking improvements in some patients. Gene identification can therefore have significant implications for accurate diagnosis, therapy, future prognostication, genetic counselling and medicolegal matters. Aims In this proposed NIHR Research Professorship, I aim to improve quality of life for patients with CP phenotypes. I willEstablish genetic diagnoses for patients with CP phenotypes of suspected genetic originInitiate gene-specific precision medicine strategiesDevelop guidelines to help clinicians both diagnose genetic forms of CP and manage these conditionsDevelop patient-derived neuronal models of disease to evaluate gene therapy and novel drug discovery Summary of Plan of InvestigationAt Great Ormond Street Hospital, I run a quaternary movement disorder service for children with complex motor disorders of undetermined aetiology. To date, I have recruited over 300 patients labelled as having CP but in whom I suspect an underlying genetic disorder. Following on from my successful pilot study, I plan to:Undertake genetic investigations in children with CP phenotypes in order to identify causative genes and new human diseases that mimic CPConfirm mutation pathogenicity where necessary through an established functional pipeline in my research laboratoryRapidly translate research findings into clinical practice by prompt addition of validated genes to NHS multigene panels and diagnostic exomesDevelop consensus guidelines for investigating CP and managing genetic forms of CPDevelop human induced pluripotent stem cells from patient fibroblasts for differentiation into neurons. These neuronal cell models of genetic CP will be ideal for drug discovery and evaluation of gene therapy strategies Summary of Potential Benefits to Patients and NHSMy proposed fellowship will have clear rapid benefit to NHS patients. Gene discovery will aid accurate diagnosis, which can provide enormous relief for families, who have often had a difficult and tortuous diagnostic path. It can give families a sense of closure, allow prognostication and inform genetic counselling for future pregnancies. My research functional pipeline will further aid diagnostic certainty by determining the pathogenicity of novel, previously unreported variants. My work will also improve NHS diagnostic genetic testing as research genes will be rapidly translated into clinical practice by prompt addition to multigene panels and diagnostic exomes. My plan to develop consensus guidelines for genetic forms of CP will no doubt optimise patient diagnosis and treatment. Finally, gene discovery will facilitate a precision medicine approach for NHS patients, either through currently available therapies or through novel drug development. Using patient-derived neuronal cell models of genetic CP will be the perfect research platform to develop treatments for these neurological disorders.

41	Professor Richard Kaplan	University College London	None	2015-03-01	2021-12-31	CANCER: Stratified medicine and translational science within large scale RCTs	This topic encompasses biomarker-stratified trials and trial designs specifically developed to progress implementation of the stratified/precision clinical medicine of the future, as well as the necessary underpinning translational research in the context of large multicentre RCTs. Where translational/correlative science and late-phase trials fit together synergistically is in the discovery, confirmation, validation, and testing for clinical utility of predictors of response (or non-response) to new treatments or approaches. Without an RCT of appropriate design it may not be possible to ascertain whether a putative biomarker is prognostic, predictive of the effect of a specific treatment, or both. Translational research is more complicated than simply collecting specimens and correlating with clinical trial data; it also requires planning an array of complementary studies and fully integrating correlative research into large-scale national trials. This includes managing specimen banks; maintaining and managing systems for access to specimens by the broad oncology research community; regulatory and Intellectual Property (IP) management; specimen cross-collaboration for trials that recruit internationally; marker cross-validation between laboratories; and more. This project includes the collection of specimens and data from multiple or sequential trials in a various disease settings, which can be critical in confirming biomarkers identifying relatively rare cohorts. In some tumour types, where we have a history of leading many trials (for example colorectal, gastro-oesophageal and gynaecological cancers), the correlative science involves several dozen different projects, each of which contributes to the value of the growing annotated data set. Our capabilities in this sphere have been critical to developing the FOCUS4 stratified trial design, dual funded by the MRC/NIHR Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation (EME) Programme and Cancer Research UK. A further award from the MRC Stratified Medicine initiative will support our collaboration in, and coordination of, the S-CORT consortium, a stratification programme in colorectal cancer. Within this programme we will build and manage a comprehensive database that fully integrates large scale genomic expression and methylation data, as well as data on circulating tumour DNA, development of drug resistance, ex-vivo tumour lines and heterogeneity, and the more classical single biomarker, pathway, signature, and clinical data.

42	Professor Deborah Mackay	University of Southampton	None	2016-03-01	2018-02-28	Maths, Engineering and Life Sciences: making connections for precision medicine	A multitude of biological and environmental factors interact to mediate human development, health and disease. It follows that a number of data types are required to describe these factors; one-dimensional viewpoints – even omic datasets – are one-dimensional oversimplifications of extraordinarily complex multi-cellular systems. To power precision medicine, we must build a multi-dimensional picture, by integrating data from multiple viewpoints from the single-cell level upwards. Our overarching aim is to develop a step change in research capability towards precision medicine at the University of Southampton. We request funding for a microfluidic engineer, a systems biologist, to promote collaboration between mathematical, computational, engineering, biology and medical specialisms in a new interdisciplinary laboratory. We request equipment to develop new quantal microfluidic processes to increase information depth and resolution down to the single cell level, novel analytical methods will then model the complexity of human disease. This investment will produce new technology and methods to capture unique cross-cutting datasets in disease systems, and new multi-dimensional analytical strategies in molecular systems biology. It will not only uncover the spatiotemporal architecture of development in single cells and cell populations; it will promote an imaginative, systems-biological mind-set, and a common vocabulary of research and enquiry in microfluidics, data science, and medical research across rare, infectious, acquired and non-communicable disease. The lasting impact of this investment will be new tools and concepts for human development and disease, and resultant advances towards the personalised therapeutic and preventative strategies that are the vision of precision medicine.

43	Dr Manel Esteller Badosa	Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (Idibell)	None	2015-01-01	2017-12-31	Investigating Drug Resistance Through Epigenetic Aberrations in Melanoma	In melanomas, the frequent mutation of the mitogenic cell signaling component BRAF provides of valuable biomarker for the treatment with specific therapies using BRAF or MEK inhibitors. However, the persisting poor prognosis of melanoma patients, due to drug resistance and early relapse, underscores the need for additional biomarkers that complement currently applied stratification strategies. In this respect, recent translational research suggests a clinical value of regulatory events; and in particular DNA methylation, which has been recognized as common hallmark of human cancers. Although DNA methylation represents a promising biomarker for clinical diagnosis, prognosis and with a plethora of alterations displaying predictive potential for drug response, the potential of DNA methylation alterations in individualized cancer medicine has yet been poorly recognized. Consequently, we comprehensively screen epigenetic alterations in metastatic melanoma specimens and model systems for their translational value as biomarkers for drug resistance, in order to suggest novel therapeutic strategies overcoming drug resistance. Specifically, we profile a unique set of samples, consisting of drug resistant melanoma cell lines and donor-matched metastatic tumours at genome-scale for differentially DNA methylated loci. Furthermore, we integrate comprehensive DNA methylation and drug sensitivity data to BRAF and MEK inhibitors, to determine predictive models of the efficiency of drug application in melanoma patients. Following the epigenetic association study combining DNA methylation and drug sensitivity, the functional implications of candidate loci and genes are experimentally confirmed using in vitro and in vivo melanoma model systems. Once we confirm the reliability of the candidates in multiple biological and clinical validation steps, we present epigenetic biomarkers, mechanistically incorporated in drug resistance of melanoma cells to currently applied targeted drugs, which provide a rich source for novel therapeutic strategies applicable as precision medicine for melanoma patients.

44	Dr. Marco Helmut GERLINGER	Institute of Cancer Research	None	2014-10-01	2018-09-30	Genetic profiling and targeting of heterogeneous and evolving colorectal and renal cancers	Background Solid tumours can be composed of multiple genetically and functionally distinct subclones (Gerlinger et al, NEJM 2012 and Nature Genetics 2014). This intra-tumour heterogeneity (ITH) can foster adaptation to changing environments through Darwinian evolution and is likely to play an important role in the development of drug resistance. ITH is also a major hurdle for treatment personalisation as current molecular profiling methods are poorly suited for the assessment of heterogeneous tumours. Aims Anti-angiogenic therapy and combination chemotherapy are the most effective treatments for patients with metastatic clear cell renal cancers (ccRCC) and colorectal cancers (CRC), respectively. Resistance to these agents invariably occurs but the mechanisms of resistance remain poorly understood, precluding the development of more effective therapies. ITH and the evolution of subclones which are undetectable before treatment may have hampered the comprehensive identification of drug resistance drivers to date. Our aim is to characterize clonal evolution processes during therapy in ccRCC and CRC in order to identify: • recurrently selected drivers and mechanisms of drug resistance. • blood based biomarkers which can predict treatment outcomes in heterogeneous cancers. • new therapeutic approaches to prevent the evolution of drug resistance. Methods We will develop novel sequencing technologies which can reveal the subclonal composition of heterogeneous tumours in the cell-free DNA (cfDNA) extracted from blood samples. Analysis of longitudinally collected samples from patients with metastatic ccRCC during first-line anti-angiogenic therapy will reveal clonal dynamics and recurrent evolutionary trajectories. Modelling approaches will be applied to scrutinize whether drug resistance evolution can be predicted based on cfDNA profiles. The evolution of drug resistance in metastatic CRC during first-line combination chemotherapy will be studied through paired biopsies taken at diagnosis and at radiological progression. Whole-genome sequencing of these biopsies will be used to reconstruct the evolutionary histories of resistant clones and to identify drivers of resistance. Biopsy-derived primary cell cultures will be used to identify new therapeutic targets which can reverse or delay the evolution of chemotherapy resistance. How the results will be used: This project addresses a major need in translational oncology by delivering precision medicine technologies to comprehensively profile the genetics of heterogeneous cancers through minimally invasive blood tests. This should foster the development of novel treatment personalisation approaches. The identification of chemotherapy resistance mechanism and of therapeutic vulnerabilities of drug resistant CRC cells should lead to improved therapeutic strategies which will ultimately increase patient survival.

45	Prof. Ines THIELE	University of Luxembourg	None	2018-04-01	2023-03-31	Predicting the effects of gut microbiota and diet on an individual’s drug response and safety	Precision medicine is an emerging paradigm that aims at maximizing the benefits and minimizing the harm of drugs. Realistic mechanistic models are needed to understand and limit heterogeneity in drug responses. Consequently, novel approaches are required that explicitly account for individual variations in response to environmental influences, in addition to genetic variation. The human gut microbiota metabolizes drugs and is modulated by diet, and it exhibits significant variation among individuals. However, the influence of the gut microbiota on drug failure or drug side effects is under-researched. In this study, I will combine whole-body, genome-scale molecular resolution modeling of human metabolism and human gut microbial metabolism, which represents a network of genes, proteins, and biochemical reactions, with physiological, clinically relevant modeling of drug responses. I will perform two pilot studies on human subjects to illustrate that this innovative, versatile computational modeling framework can be used to stratify patients prior to drug prescription and to optimize drug bioavailability through personalized dietary intervention. With these studies, BugTheDrug will advance mechanistic understanding of drug-microbiota-diet interactions and their contribution to individual drug responses. I will perform the first integration of cutting-edge approaches and novel insights from four distinct research areas: systems biology, quantitative systems pharmacology, microbiology, and nutrition. BugTheDrug conceptually and technologically addresses the demand for novel approaches to the study of individual variability, thereby providing breakthrough support for progress in precision medicine.

46	Professor Christopher Gale	Leeds, University of	Leeds Institute of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Medicine	None	2023-03-31	Predicting patient-level new onset atrial fibrillation from population-based nationwide electronic health records: A precision medicine investigation using artificial intelligence	Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major cardiovascular health problem: it is common, chronic and incurs substantial health-care expenditure as a result of stroke, sudden death, heart failure and unplanned hospitalisation. There is a compelling argument for the early diagnosis of AF, before the first complication occurs, but population-based screening is not recommended. Strategies to identify individuals at higher risk of new onset AF are required. Previous risk scores have been limited by data and methodology. This PhD will use routinely collected hospital-linked primary care data and focus on the use of artificial intelligence methods to develop and validate a model for the prediction of incident AF. Specifically, the studentship will investigate how population-based data may be used for precision medicine using a deep neural networks learning model. Using clinical factors readily accessible in primary care, the studentship will provide a method for the identification of individuals in the community who are at risk of AF, as well as when incident AF will occur in those at risk, thus accelerating research assessing technologies for the improvement of risk prediction, and the targeting of high-risk individuals for preventive measures	British Heart Foundation	Fellowship	188229.0	GBP
47	Ms. Laura Linnea Maria Elo-Uhlgren	University of Turku	None	2016-06-01	2021-05-31	From longitudinal proteomics to dynamic individualized diagnostics	Longitudinal omics data hold great promise to improve biomarker detection and enable dynamic individualized predictions. Recent technological advances have made proteomics an increasingly attractive option but clinical longitudinal proteomic datasets are still rare and computational tools for their analysis underdeveloped. The objective of this proposal is to create a roadmap to detect clinically feasible protein markers using longitudinal data and effective computational tools. A biomedical focus is on early detection of Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Specific objectives are: 1) Novel biomarker detector using longitudinal data. DynaOmics introduces novel types of multi-level dynamic markers that are undetectable in conventional single-time cross-sectional studies (e.g. within-individual changes in abundance or associations), develops optimization methods for their robust and reproducible detection within and across individuals, and validates their utility in well-defined samples. 2) Individualized disease risk prediction dynamically. DynaOmics develops dynamic individualized predictive models using the multi-level longitudinal proteome features and novel statistical and machine learning methods that have previously not been used in this context, including joint models of longitudinal and time-to-event data, and one-class classification type techniques. 3) Dynamic prediction of T1D. DynaOmics builds a predictive model of dynamic T1D risk to assist early detection of the disease, which is crucial for developing future therapeutic and preventive strategies. T1D typically involves a relatively long symptom-free period before clinical diagnosis but current tools to predict early T1D risk have restricted power. The objectives involve innovative and unconventional approaches and address major unmet challenges in the field, having high potential to open new avenues for diagnosis and treatment of complex diseases and fundamentally novel insights towards precision medicine.

The objective of this proposal is to create a roadmap to detect clinically feasible protein markers using longitudinal data and effective computational tools. A biomedical focus is on early detection of Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Specific objectives are: 1) Novel biomarker detector using longitudinal data. DynaOmics introduces novel types of multi-level dynamic markers that are undetectable in conventional single-time cross-sectional studies (e.g. within-individual changes in abundance or associations), develops optimization methods for their robust and reproducible detection within and across individuals, and validates their utility in well-defined samples. 2) Individualized disease risk prediction dynamically. DynaOmics develops dynamic individualized predictive models using the multi-level longitudinal proteome features and novel statistical and machine learning methods that have previously not been used in this context, including joint models of longitudinal and time-to-event data, and one-class classification type techniques. 3) Dynamic prediction of T1D. DynaOmics builds a predictive model of dynamic T1D risk to assist early detection of the disease, which is crucial for developing future therapeutic and preventive strategies. T1D typically involves a relatively long symptom-free period before clinical diagnosis but current tools to predict early T1D risk have restricted power. The objectives involve innovative and unconventional approaches and address major unmet challenges in the field, having high potential to open new avenues for diagnosis and treatment of complex diseases and fundamentally novel insights towards precision medicine.

The development of high-throughput, low-cost technologies for studying the human and pathogen genomes, along with the epigenome, transcriptome and proteome have resulted in an exponential growth in available data. The current standard analytical approaches rely on single-level analyses of these datasets. However, complex systems, such as the host-pathogen interaction within an individual patient, can only be understood thoroughly if considered as a whole. I aim to integrate and then explore the complex genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic and clinical data of unique cohorts of infectious disease patients using advanced bioinformatics techniques. I will identify the host response that is common across different diseases, as well as the response that is unique to each disease, while unravelling relationships between the different data layers. The integrative analysis will lead to a better understanding of the key biological processes involved in the host response to infection, to the discovery of robust biomarkers, as well as disease subtypes. The results will be crucial for the identification of patient-specific interventions, and thus providing a stepping stone for bringing precision medicine closer to clinical practice.

Harmful grandiose delusions: developing a translational treatment Background: Grandiose delusions are unfounded beliefs held by patients that they have exceptional abilities, wealth or fame. They become harmful when detrimental actions ensue, such as believing one is invincible and therefore stepping into traffic or attacking a perceived assailant. Social isolation is a common consequence. Grandiose delusions occur in 25-50% of people with schizophrenia and in 35- 60% of bipolar manic episodes. They are an important treatment target but have not been subject to a systematic programme of research and there is no specific targeted treatment. This is because researchers have traditionally adopted a diagnostic approach (focusing broadly on ‘schizophrenia’), but this has yielded medical and psychological treatments with only modest effects. This is a major problem. The human costs are high (increased suicidality, isolation, physical morbidity and hospital admissions), and the annual cost to the public sector of schizophrenia alone is £7.2 billion in England. Factor analytic studies indicate that grandiose delusions are an independent psychotic experience and the adoption of a precision-medicine paradigm to develop a targeted psychological treatment is warranted. This fits with the priority for evidence-based psychological treatments demonstrated by major NHS developments: the Improving Access to Psychological Treatments – Severe Mental Illness programme, and the access and waiting time standards for Early Intervention in Psychosis services. The applicant has developed a theoretical maintenance model of grandiose delusions. This proposes that such beliefs are developed in the context of genetic and environmental risk, and maintained by factors including: repetitive thinking; disregard of feedback from others; attentional, memory, and reasoning biases; anomalous experiences (such as hearing voices); and dysregulated affect. This model needs to be refined, tested, and translated into an evidence-based, effective psychological treatment. Research aims: The primary aim is to develop the first, evidence-based, translational, psychological treatment specifically for harmful grandiose delusions. A secondary aim is to increase understanding of harmful outcomes associated with grandiose delusions. Research questions:1) What and how often do harmful outcomes occur in association with grandiose delusions?2) What factors predict maintenance of grandiose delusions?3) Is it feasible to deliver the manualised treatment, based on the maintenance model, to patients with grandiose delusions? Plan of investigation: Five studies will be undertaken. A systematic literature review will investigate harm associated with grandiose delusions, and review psychological processes implicated in their maintenance. A secondary analysis of existing large longitudinal databases , using multilevel and structural equation modelling, will test the association between grandiose delusions and harmful outcomes, and the extent to which hypothesised maintenance factors, predict persistence of grandiose delusions. A qualitative study, using thematic analysis methodology, will provide a valuable patient perspective on the experience and treatment of grandiose delusions. A longitudinal, observational study will test the ability of factors identified in the model to predict the temporal maintenance of grandiose delusions. Finally, based on these data, the model will be refined, a translational treatment protocol developed, and a feasibility study conducted. The applicant will work within the Oxford Cognitive Approaches to Psychosis (O-CAP) research team, adopting their general approach which has already significantly improved treatments for persecutory delusions. Potential benefits to patients and the NHS: This research will be a key step towards substantially improving treatments and outcomes for people with psychotic illness. It will deliver the first evidence-based, psychological treatment specifically for grandiose delusions. The intervention will be highly manualised so that mental health professionals can incorporate it within routine clinical care. After efficacy is demonstrated, the applicant’s part-time role as a CBT trainer and supervisor will provide an appropriate platform for dissemination.

Both insulin resistance in key target organs and beta cell dysfunction, the two key factors driving the disease, are thought to get progressively worse and patients with T2DM require sequential addition of therapies. Despite the therapy, cardiovascular, renal and other severe complications are common, and therefore represent an immense individual and public health cost. This is particularly true in Austria, where the number of T2DM diagnoses has almost tripled since the turn of the last century and the direct cost of treatment is relatively high. Recent studies have convincingly demonstrated that 4 out of 5 short-term diabetic patients can re-establish normoglycaemia with diet intervention. It remains enigmatic whether insulin sensitivity in key target organs or beta function has to be recovered to achieve remission. Our preliminary results support the idea that irreversible beta cell injury related to gluco- or lipotoxicity could be a key factor determining the responsiveness to the diet. The proposed project aims to use and further validate western-diet (WD)-induced mouse model of T2DM in both sexes, as well human islets, to explore the mechanism governing beta cell injury and its reversibility using acute pancreas slice approach in combination with electro-, optophysiological, as well as advanced computational and statistical methods. We will test the hypothesis that WD-induced T2DM in a mouse model primarily affects the function of the beta cells populations in islets of Langerhans. A battery of state-of-the art functional tests will enable us to discover the primary cellular pathway(s) of the beta cells injury, being nutrient sensing, excitation, Ca2+ dynamics, cell-to-cell communication or molecular events in the late steps of the insulin exocytosis process. The mouse experiments are planned in two waves that would enable us to adjust the dietary interventions period and expand the testing of diet-induced changes in non-pancreatic organs. With the proposed project we aim to develop an innovative concept to address the reversibility of pancreatic beta cell injury and success of diabetes mellitus remission after diet intervention. Such an approach will help us find new treatment strategies, better stratify patients to different treatments, and together with existing or novel pharmacological and precision medicine approaches finally cure the disease.

Currently, 300 million people (4.2%) suffer from asthma, 500 million (6.5%) from atopic dermatitis (AD), 900 million (12 %) from allergic rhinitis) and 700 million (9%) from food allergy worldwide. The prevalence of these four allergic diseases is approximately 1.7 million 22% in Switzerland. Atopic dermatitis is the most prevalent chronic disease in childhood. Asthma represents one of the highest costs to health care system. Allergic rhinitis is the number one disease for job absenteeism (missing work days) and presenteeism (being on the job, but not fully functioning because of disease). Approximately, 5-10% of all of these diseases present with severe forms and can cause deaths. It was recently shown by us and others that epithelial tight junction barrier defect plays an important role in the pathogenesis of these diseases.Epithelial barrier function: of asthmatic bronchial epithelial cells, sinus epithelial cells in chronic rhinosinusitis and skin keratinocytes in atopic dermatitis have been demonstrated to be defective and leaky. Allergens, bacterial toxins and other particles are able to penetrate the leaky epithelium, where they may activate the immune system cells leading to severe chronic inflammation. Epithelial tight junctions (TJ) are responsible for the regulation of paracellular flux and epithelial impermeability and can be considered as gatekeepers that could contribute both to aggravation of inflammation-related tissue damage or resolution of inflammation via drainage towards out side of the affected tissues. This study focuses on the regulation of particularly TJ barrier by epigenetic mechanisms and inflammasome.Planned experiments: According to our strong preliminary data, we hypothesize here that “epithelial tight junction barrier is epigenetically controlled” and “epithelial barrier leakiness is affected by inflammasome and both TJ barrier and inflammasome are epigenetically regulated”. We will perform this research in asthma and atopic dermatitis in parallel and particularly focus on in vivo relevant findings that will be obtained from direct human primary cells and biopsies as well as mouse models. We aim to demonstrate epigenetic mechanisms of bronchial and skin epithelial barrier leakiness in different endotypes and phenotypes of asthma and atopic dermatitis and bring a new perspective from bench to patient side. We will use several important and in vivo relevant stimulants to study the “barrier”, “epigenetics” and “inflammasome” triangle. They will be house dust mite, human rhinovirus, commercial detergents and their surfactants, and CpG oligonucleotides. In this way, we will be able to investigate barrier damaging and recovering as well as inflammasome-activating and -nonactivating stimulants.Impact and innovative potential: The ultimate aim of this research is to find out novel preventive and treatment ways for two major allergic diseases, asthma and atopic dermatitis to decrease the individual burden of the patients and their families, which affects almost half of the World’s population and extremely high health care costs. Our research includes disease endo and phenotyping concepts and opens a new window for a precision medicine approach to barrier leakiness, such as the establishment of leaky barrier endotype. Many aspects of this research will find broader impact in other disciplines of human and veterinary medicine, because similar mechanisms of epithelial barrier dysregulation play roles in other diseases such as chronic rhinosinusitis, COPD and inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, epigenetic regulation of inflammasome activation thresholds has a link to essentially all inflammatory diseases.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div.

Realistic mechanistic models are needed to understand and limit heterogeneity in drug responses. Consequently, novel approaches are required that explicitly account for individual variations in response to environmental influences, in addition to genetic variation. The human gut microbiota metabolizes drugs and is modulated by diet, and it exhibits significant variation among individuals. However, the influence of the gut microbiota on drug failure or drug side effects is under-researched. In this study, I will combine whole-body, genome-scale molecular resolution modeling of human metabolism and human gut microbial metabolism, which represents a network of genes, proteins, and biochemical reactions, with physiological, clinically relevant modeling of drug responses. I will perform two pilot studies on human subjects to illustrate that this innovative, versatile computational modeling framework can be used to stratify patients prior to drug prescription and to optimize drug bioavailability through personalized dietary intervention. With these studies, BugTheDrug will advance mechanistic understanding of drug-microbiota-diet interactions and their contribution to individual drug responses. I will perform the first integration of cutting-edge approaches and novel insights from four distinct research areas: systems biology, quantitative systems pharmacology, microbiology, and nutrition. BugTheDrug conceptually and technologically addresses the demand for novel approaches to the study of individual variability, thereby providing breakthrough support for progress in precision medicine.

Patients will be classified using data-driven phenotyping algorithm using their so-far-complete healthcare trajectory. Patients' linked electronic health records (EHR) including primary and secondary care data as well as socio-economic and mortality data will be utilised collected from diverse sources such as Barts Health Data Warehouse, NHS Discovery Project East London, CPRD and NCRAS. The PaC events (incidence, recurrence, death) and comparison of these to rates in matched controls will be estimated using appropriate statistical models. Association between various exposures and outcomes will be measured in terms of odds ratios, with length and dose of exposure to known risk factors as stratification categories. Objective 2: The -omics data available through cancer-specific initiatives (TCGA, GENIE) as well as molecular data repositories (GEO, ArrayExpress) will be analysed in combination with relevant literature mining to collate existing genomic characterisations of PaC in terms of gene/mutational signatures. The assessment of molecular characteristics of PaC associated to clinical history will be conducted on data derived from PCRF Tissue Bank. Consensus clustering algorithm will be applied to obtain new stratifications of PaC along the themes of disease onset, progression, survival and response to treatment. The association between the expression/mutational status of specific PaC genes and risk/prognostic factors, longitudinal data and response to treatment will be tested. All the data obtained through the project will be published in a mine-able web-based bioinformatics infrastructure.	Medical Research Council	Fellowship	290233.0	GBP
63	Dr Ailith Ewing	University of Edinburgh	MRC Human Genetics Unit	2018-02-01	2021-01-31	Precision medicine and the mutational landscape of high grade serous ovarian cancer	High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) makes up 75% of new diagnoses of ovarian cancer in Scotland and is almost always diagnosed after the disease has spread. As a result, the 5-year overall survival rate remains low at around 40%. HGSOC is characterised by ubiquitous somatic TP53 mutations and elevated rates of structural variants (SVs) which are thought to drive tumourigenesis. However, HGSOC is poorly understood at the genomic level and the number of available samples is modest. We will analyse high quality whole genome sequencing (WGS) data emerging from a large study of HGSOC (led by Prof. Gourley and co-funded by AstraZeneca) in 200 Scottish patients. Detailed histopathological and clinical data are available for these patients through the Edinburgh Ovarian Cancer Database (Gourley). Using this resource, we will examine the origins and consequences of the somatic mutational landscape of HGSOC. We will calculate mutational spectra in HGSOC WGS samples, as has been done for breast cancer (Nik-Zainal et al, Cell, 2012), and explore their utility in predicting clinical variables, including disease progression and therapeutic responses. We will investigate the role of germline genetic variation in determining mutational spectra and other tumour signatures, such as gene expression signatures, using association testing. The generalisability of our observations will be established by integrating our data with previously published HGSOC WGS data (Patch et al, Nature, 2015) and associated clinical data. We will explore the clinical utility of mutational spectra extracted from the larger cohort (N=450) of FFPE samples. Developing analyses for large collections of FFPE samples may have broader translational impact across oncology globally. We will investigate the utility of newly identified complex SVs in HGSOC in patient stratification as well as investigating the predictive power gained from including these variants in mutational spectra.

This proposal aims to harness the potential of large-scale integrated genetic and health data to spur innovation, and develop predictive algorithms to improve clinical decision making and patient health. Specifically, this will focus on the development and evaluation of ML and DL frameworks for GWAS, and clinical risk prediction using publicly available large-scale EHR and genomics biodata resources, including UK Biobank, Genomics England and INTERVAL studies. Transcriptomic and functional data will be integrated into these using predictive approaches, where this has not been directly measured. This will be implemented in three stages: 1) assessment of complex time-dependent statistical approaches for modelling of hazard; 2) optimisation and assessment of existing ML and DL approaches for modelling of clinical risk; 3) development of novel approaches, specifically using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to incorporate temporality and missingness in clinical data, including time varying covariates to accurately model complex hazard functions; the objective of this project will be to develop approaches that appropriately leverage the rich longitudinal and time-dependent data on individuals shown by us and others to substantially improve clinical risk prediction. In addition to risk prediction, this proposal will also focus on improving our understanding of genetic aetiology of disease. In addition to standard GWAS approaches, hybrid ML and GWAS approaches for prioritisation of candidate genes, and genetic variants associated with disease will also be applied, potentially improving the power to identify novel associations, with important implications for prioritisation of therapeutic targets.

Therefore, pathogen DNA enrichment is crucial and we are developing novel strategies to achieve this, removing the vast majority of the human DNA from blood and reducing the ratio of human:pathogen DNA < 10:1. This will enable us to develop sequencing based workflows for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of sepsis which will result in reduced patient morbidity and mortality. Objectives: (1) Further develop and optimise our current pathogen DNA enrichment strategy and to test two new enrichment strategies (2) Test a number of NGS technologies/platforms to determine the most suitable in terms of analysis time, flexibility, complexity of bioinformatics analysis, cost and comprehensiveness of sequencing results (3) Run a clinical diagnostics evaluation study of an optimised NGS based diagnostic method Objective 1: Method 1 (current method): We will continue to develop the current method and determine the limit of detection of this method. Method 2: We have devised a second novel approach to pathogen DNA enrichment involving the removal of human DNA using nucleic acid capture. Method 3: This approach is designed to ensure detection of both intracellular/phagocytosed pathogens and cell free pathogen DNA while readily removing human DNA. Objective 2: Short read (Illumina MiSeq) sequencing technology will be compared to nanopore (MinION and PromethION) sequencing technology to determine which is best suited to infectious diseases diagnostics. Objective 3: The performance of the optimised sepsis diagnostic workflow will be tested on 50 biobanked blood samples from sepsis patients and controls. The arising NGS results will be compared to blood culture, PCR (Septifast) and the clinical gold standard diagnosis.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	203551.0	GBP
67	Professor Aletta Schutte	North-West University	None	2016-10-05	2020-02-04	The African Prospective study on the Early Detection and Identification of Cardiovascular disease and Hypertension (African-PREDICT)	Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one cause of death world-wide. But Africa is known for its tremendous burden of infectious diseases. With the introduction of antiretroviral therapy, the scene is starting to change with indicators pointing that dramatic increases in the incidence of hypertension and subsequent CVD, will overtake infectious diseases in the near future. Economic progress in African countries, come at a significant cost to the health burden. Although antihypertensive medication is highly cost-effective, the weak health systems in Africa fail to ensure awareness, treatment and control. The status quo can thus not be maintained in Africa concerning current practices to manage hypertension. It may have significantly greater impact if tailored population- and individual targeted prevention strategies are employed in the whole population, but especially in young individuals to early detect, prevent or delay hypertension onset. Such strategies should be based on (a) a clear understanding of the pathophysiological development of hypertension over time in young black populations; (b) coupled with objectively measured health behaviours. The African-PREDICT study was designed to address both aspects by longitudinally tracking and monitoring hypertension development in 1200 healthy black and white individuals (aged 20-30 years). We include apparently healthy men and women of African and European descent from low/mid/high levels of socio-economic status; with brachial blood pressure (BP) < 140 and 90 mmHg; HIV uninfected; no previous diagnosis or medication for chronic disease; and not pregnant or breastfeeding. Within a Hypertension Clinic at the North-West University in South Africa, we perform a wide range of basic and advanced measurements at each visit. We obtain: (1) Questionnaire data including medical history, social status, traditional risk factors (age, sex, smoking, alcohol intake) and dietary intake (24 hour dietary recall on 3 days within a week), personality, psychological distress and psychosocial profile; (2) Biological samples for biomarker analyses (blood, spot & 24hr urine) are preserved at -80°C. The study was designed to assess a wide range of traditional and novel biomarkers, including (i) the RAS Fingerprint™ covering 10 peptides from the renin-angiotensin system; (ii) pro-inflammatory multiplex biomarker analyses and urinary proteomic profiles; (iii) urinary metabolomics, with targeted genomics to be performed at a later stage; (3) Anthropometric measurements, bio-electrical impedance – body fat% and lean mass, and 7-day accelerometric physical activity monitoring; (4) Blood Pressure: 24-hour BP, central BP, and cardiovascular stress reactivity tests; and (5) Assessments of early target organ damage include albuminuria, carotid wall thickness and distensibility, ECG, echocardiography, pulse wave velocity, and retinal microvasculature. Since the study sample comprises participants in their twenties, we anticipate few hard end points (e.g. stroke) in the 10 years of follow-up. The focus will be on ‘soft’ surrogate end points, including changes in biomarker profiles and early target organ damage. By employing also in Africa the latest cutting-edge research on biomarkers and polyomics proven to predict hypertension and cardiovascular outcome, precision medicine may have the potential to lead to novel strategies in preventing and treating hypertension in Africa.

68	Dr Bryony Sheaves	University of Oxford	None	2018-06-01	2021-05-31	Stopping abusive voices from distressing patients with schizophrenia	Background: The majority of patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia hear voices (70%). Around half report their voice(s) to be persistently abusive or violent. Hence it is unsurprising that voice hearers experience depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, suicidality and, when acute, hospital admission. Current treatments require substantial improvement: antipsychotic medication is only moderately effective and generic CBT results in only small improvements in voices. Evidence suggests that the diagnosis of schizophrenia is comprised of multiple independent psychotic experiences including hearing voices (as well as for example paranoid and grandiose beliefs). The heritability of these individual experiences differs and there are distinct genetic and environmental contributions to each. The most fruitful approach to improving outcomes will be to use a precision medicine paradigm, understanding the unique psychological mechanisms maintaining each psychotic experience and building a treatment which targets them. Within voices alone there are multiple differing presentations. One of the most successful existing treatments targets just one of these voice presentations: command hallucinations. The current application therefore adopts a similarly focused approach to understanding and treating a different voice presentation: engagement with abusive voices. The applicant has developed a cognitive framework for understanding why patients listen to and believe (i.e. engage with) abusive voices. This proposes that key cognitions (thoughts) drive engagement with voices (e.g. the voice has important information), despite the patient knowing that if they engage with the voices, this will leave them feeling distressed. This framework forms the foundations upon which a cognitive model will be developed, based on qualitative analysis of patient experiences. The components of the model will be empirically tested to inform the development of a targeted intervention. Research aims: There are three aims: i) to develop the first model of engagement with abusive voices ii) to refine the model and gather predictive data (ie. how well do key psychological variables in the model predict engagement with abusive voices?) and iii) develop the model into a targeted treatment which enables patients to disengage from abusive voices. Research questions: i) What psychological variables (i.e. cognitions, cognitive styles, attentional styles and affect) are described by people who have experience of engaging with abusive voices? ii) Which psychological variables predict engagement with voices over time? iii) Is it feasible and acceptable to deliver a CBT treatment protocol, based on the above model of engagement, to patients experiencing abusive voices? Plan of investigation: Study one will build a maintenance model of engagement with voices. This will involve a qualitative study with patients to identify psychological factors which promote engagement with abusive voices. From this a cognitive model of voice engagement will be developed. Study two will i) develop and validate a new measure of voice engagement and ii) test the association between model components and engagement with abusive voices over time, using a longitudinal observational design. The model will be refined in light of results and study three will develop a treatment which manipulates key variables to reduce engagement with distressing voices. Potential benefit to patients and the NHS: This programme of translational research will develop a novel targeted treatment, based on a thorough mechanistic understanding of psychological factors which predict engagement with voices. The targeted treatment for abusive voices can be further evaluated in a randomised controlled trial. Patient involvement will ensure that the treatment is highly acceptable to voice hearers. Manual style workbooks and training workshops delivered by the applicant will enable the treatment to be disseminated easily to NHS clinicians. The treatment could be offered as a stand-alone intervention, or added to treatments for other symptoms such as paranoia.

The nucleases Cas9 and Cas12a (Cpf1) can be readily programmed using short RNA molecules to generate targeted double-strand DNA breaks in the genome, whose subsequent repair is then exploited to engineer genetic modifications. Despite extensive studies, several aspects of the molecular mechanisms of Cas9 and Cas12a, such as initial target DNA binding and final DNA cleavage, are not fully understood. At the same time, CRISPR-Cas genome editing suffers from limitations such as off-target activity, necessitating on-going technological development to improve the specificity of genome editor nucleases for gene therapeutic applications.Building on our pioneering work in the field, the proposed research will examine the molecular interactions underpinning the activities of Cas9 and Cas12a nucleases, specifically aiming to (i) dissect the mechanisms of Cas9- mediated DNA binding and catalytic activation in Cas9, (ii) determine the structural basis of Cas9âs off-target activity, and (iii) elucidate the DNA cleavage mechanism of Cas12a. To address key steps in the molecular mechanism of Cas9, X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy will be used to determine the structures of Cas9 bound to a partially unwound DNA target and an activated-state Cas9-DNA complex trapped using engineered disulphide cross- links. Off-target activity of Cas9 will be investigated by determining a series of crystal structures of Cas9 bound to bona fide off-target DNAs in order to systematically document off-target interactions such as single-nucleotide mismatches and bulges tolerated by the nuclease. The resulting structural insights will be used to derive a comprehensive off- targeting model with improved predictive power that will subsequently be validated using DNA binding and cleavage assays in vitro and genome editing experiments in vivo. Biochemical investigations of Cas12a will initially define the order and interdependence of strand cleavage events in the canonical cis-cleavage mechanism acting on double-stranded DNA substrates. In turn, X-ray crystallographic analysis of Cas12a in complex with a crRNA guide and a single- stranded DNA target will reveal the conformational activation mechanism responsible for its recently described trans- cleavage activity. Together, these studies will pave the way for subsequent investigations of the catalytic mechanism of target DNA cleavage using time-resolved crystallography.Taking a multidisciplinary approach combining structural studies with biochemical, biophysical and genome editing experiments, the proposed studies will shed light on critical steps in the molecular mechanisms of Cas9 and Cas12a. In doing so, they will not only advance our understanding of their functions but will also provide a mechanistic framework for future structure-guided engineering of these enzymes to improve their efficiency and specificity. In particular, structural analysis of Cas9 off-target activity will be pivotal for developing new off-target prediction and diagnostic tools, as well as engineered high-fidelity Cas9 variants to address the safety of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in genetic and cellular therapies. Taken together, the proposed research will make a substantial impact on the CRISPR field and a timely contribution to harnessing the potential of CRISPR-Cas genome editing for medical applications.

Our framework will be a CRC-specific web platform that allows the integrated analysis of multi-omics data (e.g. DNA sequencing, transcriptomics and methylation) with clinical/pathological data through a RESTful Application programming interface (API) coupled with dynamic data visualisation functionalities. The framework will be polyglot persistent and facilitates the merging of both SQL and Non-SQL database management systems (DBMS). The frameworks core will implement a 'plug and play' architecture which is built to act as an umbrella for multiple loosely coupled and highly cohesive statistical application modules (apps), each of which can be built and customised to address different analytical needs using well established statistical programming languages (e.g. R, Python). The apps available within the framework will be wide ranging and consist of many of the gold standard techniques used for data processing, visualisation and feature selection. This pipeline will help identify molecular subtypes, robust gene expression signatures, map important biological pathways and perform in silico pathology characterisation within proprietary and publically available CRC patient data cohorts. The Stratification of ColoRecTal cancer (S:CORT) consortium has generated comprehensive datasets from large retrospective and clinical trial cohorts (e.g. - MRC FOCUS). In collaboration with partners, such as S:CORT, we will use our platform to interrogate these datasets in order to develop new tests that predict which patients will respond to different treatments, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery. Finally, our framework will maintain a highly flexible and scalable design structure to permit cancer-agnostic analysis in future projects.	Medical Research Council	Fellowship	279158.0	GBP

Traits to be analysed include smoking initiation, cessation, quantity (cigarettes per day) and dependence (combining smoking quantity and time to the first cigarette). The variables to be used in association testing will be derived and harmonised from the answers to the questionnaires used in each cohort. Individuals of European, Asian and African ancestry will be included in ancestry-specific and trans-ethnic genome-wide association studies. Methods from population genetics will be combined with association testing for the analysis of individuals of admixed ancestry. Discovery analyses will be carried out using the data made available by UK Biobank, a large longitudinal study which includes samples from 500,000 volunteers aged 40-69 years, where the three ancestries of interest are all represented. Replication analyses will be carried out in ancestry-specific cohorts. Linear mixed model association testing will be used under an additive genetic model for all phenotypes, including sex and age as covariates. On the associated variants, in silico functional follow-up analyses interrogating public databases will include eQTL analyses and variant annotation with the aim of identifying regions and genes of interest. On the genes identified, pathway and druggability analyses will be performed to understand the impact of the findings.	Medical Research Council	Fellowship	292991.0	GBP

This will provide deeper phenotyping and should allow more precise prediction algorithms to be developed. Advanced statistical modelling (logistic regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, Bayesian modelling) and machine learning approaches (neural nets, deep learning algorithms) will be used as part of this approach. The precision and incremental value of additional datasets will be assessed as will automated approaches to optimising algorithms. Existing research in the use of Bayesian hierarchical point-mass models, based around body-systems, to detect safety signals in clinical trials may be extended for use in observational studies. This approach is designed to use the additional information given by the relationships within and between body-systems in a statistical analysis. The outcomes of the project, in this case the prediction models, will be translated into Clinical Decision Support (CDS) tools which will promote learning health systems. User and usability experience data will be captured during CDS design and development. The output will be a prototype intervention suitable for evaluation through the MRC Complex Intervention Framework to support clinicians in making informed choices and highlighting the risks in the different possible prescribing choices.

This proposal aims to harness the potential of large-scale integrated genetic and health data to spur innovation, and develop predictive algorithms to improve clinical decision making and patient health. Specifically, this will focus on the development and evaluation of ML and DL frameworks for GWAS, and clinical risk prediction using publicly available large-scale EHR and genomics biodata resources, including UK Biobank, Genomics England and INTERVAL studies. Transcriptomic and functional data will be integrated into these using predictive approaches, where this has not been directly measured. This will be implemented in three stages: 1) assessment of complex time-dependent statistical approaches for modelling of hazard; 2) optimisation and assessment of existing ML and DL approaches for modelling of clinical risk; 3) development of novel approaches, specifically using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to incorporate temporality and missingness in clinical data, including time varying covariates to accurately model complex hazard functions; the objective of this project will be to develop approaches that appropriately leverage the rich longitudinal and time-dependent data on individuals shown by us and others to substantially improve clinical risk prediction. In addition to risk prediction, this proposal will also focus on improving our understanding of genetic aetiology of disease. In addition to standard GWAS approaches, hybrid ML and GWAS approaches for prioritisation of candidate genes, and genetic variants associated with disease will also be applied, potentially improving the power to identify novel associations, with important implications for prioritisation of therapeutic targets.

The objectives of the research are to improve the prediction of the onset of co-morbidities between mental and physical health conditions (such as major depressive disorder and diabetes) and related adverse outcomes (e.g. hospitalisation and mortality). A range of data sources will be used to test the utility of implementing a machine learning approach to prediction. For example, using the UK Biobank and Generation Scotland cohorts will allow the exploration of a range of biological, environmental and lifestyle factors. Linked administrative health data (including the Scottish Morbidity Records, disease registers, Prescribing Information System, mortality records and the census) will facilitate the exploration of patients' complex medical histories and social characteristics (e.g. occupations). Machine learning algorithms (e.g. deep neural networks and random forest) will be used to learn from patterns in a range of big data by splitting the data into training and test datasets, assessing the algorithm performance and comparing the results with other methodological approaches. By identifying factors that are highly predictive of physical and mental health comorbidities and adverse outcomes, there is great potential to develop new approaches to patient stratification and novel precision medicine interventions. Collecting these data within medical settings may facilitate the development of improved diagnostic, treatment and preventative measures in clinical and public health practice.

75	Dr Sach Mukherjee	MRC Biostatistics Unit	None	2014-03-01	2016-11-30	Statistics and machine learning for precision medicine	Our work focuses on the development and application of statistical and machine learning approaches that can exploit molecular and genomic data to assist in directing therapies to patients likely to benefit. Our efforts encompass both (i) direct prediction of therapeutic response and (ii) scalable estimation of molecular networks and dynamics that can shed light on disease mechanisms and heterogeneity, inform prediction of response and help in identifying promising therapeutic opportunities. We work on specific biomedical questions, addressed in collaboration with experimental groups, as well as methodological research in statistics and machine learning motivated by such questions. The potential of computational approaches in medicine is increasingly clear, but the challenges posed by noisy and incomplete data, biological and clinical heterogeneity and complex underlying processes and dynamics remain substantial. Our work is aimed at developing and exploiting statistical methods that can help to surmount some of these challenges. High-dimensional approaches, networks and graphical models and inference for dynamical systems are key methodological themes in much of our work. Two key ongoing projects are: Data-driven characterization of biological networks in cancer. How is the genomic heterogeneity of cancer manifested at the level of biological networks, such as those involved in cell signalling? Do cancers show altered “wiring” due to genomic aberrations? And if so, how? In close collaboration with experimental partners, we are working on both theoretical and applied aspects of these questions. We are also investigating whether protein signalling networks differ by cancer type and how networks can be used to help discover and define cancer subtypes. Finally, we are developing scalable methodologies by which to systematically assess causal network estimation approaches using interventional data. Statistical methods for personalized medicine. We are addressing statistical challenges that arise in the prediction of drug response from multiple high-throughput data types. These challenges include the large number of potential predictors (high-dimensionality), heterogeneity arising from known and unknown disease subtypes, limited number of samples and the need to integrate multiple data types.

Background: Molecular digital pathology (MDP) and quantitative tissue imaging are central to modern molecular pathology, biomarker discovery, clinical trials and precision medicine. Aims: This CRUK Accelerator award is aimed at establishing a MDP network of CRUK Centres, led by Belfast, to build resource and manpower, drive adoption of the technology in cancer research, integrate systems, establish technology standards and grow our reputation and leadership in this field. In tandem, this proposal aims to significantly improve UK training/education in molecular pathology, recognised as a major gap, through the establishment of an MSc-driven Fellowship Training Programme in molecular pathology. Methods: Belfast CRUK Centre will act as the lead, given its strong track record in digital pathology, molecular pathology and developing an integrated pipeline for discovery and diagnostics in cancer. The other CRUK Centres within the network have been selected where strong research programmes and collaborative opportunities will benefit from the accelerated development of DMP capacity. A number of key scientific themes will be pursued across Centres, focused on the genotyping of epithelia and immune cancer compartments in breast, lung, colorectal, prostate and CNS cancers, as well as automated tumour analysis for next generation sequencing. The over-arching goals are to provide a UK-digital hub for remote storage/sharing of tissue images, to standardise imaging methodologies, to integrate technologies and support data-exchange between Centres. Each centre is also committed to improving training and education in molecular and digital pathology training across the UK. By establishing 16 Clinical Fellowships through an MSc degree per year, over a 4 year period, delivered in Belfast with cross-centre projects, we will provide candidates with in depth experience in molecular pathology – further strengthening growth and leadership in these areas. This will establish a model for modern pathology training nationally in translational research. How results of this research will be used: The proposal will create a platform that will allow the systematic characterization of the epithelial and immune components of cancer. Initially, it will be applied to specific subgroups of breast and prostate cancers, to inform future immune therapy strategies. Furthermore, the share of technology and software licenses available to all Centres in the application will create a UK-MDP Hub, making MDP available to virtually all CR-UK driven projects. In addition, this proposal sets the basis for the systematic training of UK pathologists and scientists in molecular pathology to create a sustainable, national resource of talent.

Despite clear clinical and biological differences between individual patients with PAH the treatment is uniform, based on an algorithm that matches the number of vasodilator drugs to functional class. I aim to establish SMURF1 inhibition as a novel anti-proliferative therapy and pathway for precision medicine for patients with PAH. I have demonstrated that SMAD-specific ubiquitin ligase regulatory factor-1 (SMURF1) is critical to pulmonary vascular remodelling and experimental PAH, and that SMURF1 mRNA expression is detectable and increased in peripheral blood from patients with PAH. In November 2015 my collaborators (Novartis) patented a series of SMURF1 inhibitors. Through this Fellowship I will use cutting edge RNA and protein profling techniques to determine mechanism though which SMURF1 mediates disease pathology and, using samples and clinical data from the worlds largest and best genotyped-phenotyped cohort of patients with PAH (the UK National Cohort), investigate means of identifying patients with cellular abnormalities related to SMURF1 who may benefit from a SMURF1 targeted therapy.

The “cargo carriers,” or endosomes, of certain large bowel cancer cells contain overactive NHE9 proteins, which leak out too many protons and lowers their acidity. This slows down the “removal rate” of cancer-promoting cargo from the cell surface and thereby increases the capacity of cancer cells to form, grow and spread. The proposed research intends to examine the idea that targeting NHE9 could help successfully fight the deadly disease.	DBT/Wellcome Trust India Alliance	Early Career Fellowship	1.85196E+7	INR

As a clinician specialising in MDS and leading a diagnostics laboratory, I have seen how vital it is to obtain the correct diagnosis for patients. I have been in the field of haematology for over 10 years and this has been most striking to me in MDS. This diagnostic difficulty is largely due to cellular heterogeneity, which is masked using our current laboratory tests. Single cell genomic testing will overcome diagnostic difficulties resulting from cellular heterogeneity. Aim: To establish the feasibility and initial utility of introducing single cell genomics into a clinical laboratory, to improve precision diagnostics in MDS. Methods: 1.) Optimisation exercise introducing single cell genomic analysis into the diagnostic evaluation of MDS. I will set up a prospective study and recruit patients referred with suspected MDS, collecting genetic and clinical data. 2.) To correlate single cell genomics data with routine diagnostic modalities in a cohort of MDS patients. Routine laboratory investigations will be performed in parallel with a single cell genomics platform (CITE-seq), which will enable immunophenotyping and RNA-seq of individual bone marrow cells. We aim to benchmark this technology against current standards of diagnosis. The single cell work will be performed by the single cell facility at the WIMM, which is establishing a good clinical laboratory practice accredited laboratory. These data will determine whether CITE-seq correlates with and might ultimately replace current diagnostic modalities for MDS. We will refine these pipelines, to be transferred into a clinical setting.This grant will then enable a future study, powered to investigate the impact on long term patient outcomes. Outcomes: My goal is to address the unmet need for the accurate diagnosis and classification of MDS. Addressing this issue is essential for improved clinical decision making and personalised medicine. Our pipeline will also be of great value beyond MDS.

The phenotypic association between severe mental illness and cardio-metabolic traits is bidirectional. Recent advances in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have shown that common genetic loci play an important role in the aetiology of these complex traits. A growing body of evidence suggest that common loci associated with complex traits act through effects on gene regulation, such as epigenetic effects. The aim of the proposed research is to investigate the associations between severe mental illness and cardio-metabolic traits using a prediction modelling approach incorporating phenotypic, and (epi)genetic data. This will be achieved by considering the following aims: 1. Use a prediction modelling approach to examine which cardio-metabolic traits best predict clinical outcomes, prognosis and treatment response in severe mental illness. 2. I will use GWAS and methylation data to examine the shared genetic architecture between severe mental illness and cardio-metabolic traits. Following this I will use Mendelian randomization to examine the direction of effect. 3. I will utilise the information from objective 1 & 2 to combine polygenic risk scores, environmental factors and blood biomarkers for cardio-metabolic traits to predict clinical outcomes, prognosis and treatment response in severe mental illness. In all three objectives I will use data from population based cohorts such as UK Biobank, GS and ELSA, clinical disease ascertained samples and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, as well as data from electronic health records both here at Kings and at the University of Bristol. These objectives move forward precision medicine by combining genetic and environmental risk factors and blood biomarkers to detect those at high risk for cardio-metabolic traits early in the course of severe mental illness and would inform the choice of medication or preventive strategies, thereby reducing the burden of cardio-metabolic traits in severe mental illness.

The list of potential actionable genetic changes continues to grow. Crucial to the efficient testing of multiple biomarker/drug combinations is a screening platform designed to detect the genetic changes in samples typically obtained from patients with advanced NSCLC. CR-UK’s Stratified Medicine Programme 2 (SMP2) will undertake large volume national molecular pre-screening using an Illumina NGS platform, which will integrate with a national clinical trial to further test the principle of precision medicine in NSCLC and identify new bona fide targeted treatments. The National Lung Matrix Trial consists of a series of parallel, multi-centre, single-arm phase II trials, each arm testing an experimental targeted drug in a population stratified by multiple pre-specified target biomarkers. There are currently 8 targeted drugs and 21 different drug-biomarker combinations. The aim is to determine whether there is sufficient signal of activity in any drug-biomarker combination to warrant further investigation. The study will be open at all ECMCs and will be carried out under a single clinical trial protocol and regulatory submission. The study is adaptive allowing rapid incorporation of new biomarker/drug combinations via substantial amendment. All arms incorporate comprehensive ctDNA analysis, supplemented with pre-and post-therapy tissue biopsy, for detection of predictive biomarkers, early detection of resistance and determination of mechanisms of resistance. The National Lung Matrix Trial is the largest precision trial in NSCLC. Sustainability will be ensured by inclusion of formal phase Ib testing of novel combinations, the potential to assess biomarker specificity in biomarker negative patients and the introduction of new pharma partners to the SMP-2/National Lung Matrix Trial consortium.

Our studies have had significant impact on melanoma patient care. We have developed tractable models of melanoma that have allowed us to study gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. With our move to Manchester, we have established excellent connections to clinical colleagues at the Christie NHS Foundation Trust, and developed a translational programme that aims to inform patient stratification and the clinical management of melanoma and other cancers. Aims: Our aims are: • To investigate how ultraviolet light drives melanoma development. • To develop new treatments for uveal melanoma. • To develop new drugs for melanoma and other cancers. • To develop new treatments for prostate cancer. • To develop a precision medicine platform for melanoma and other cancers. Methods: Underpinning all of our studies are the models of disease we have developed and refined over the past ten years, including genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) and patient-derived models (cell lines, PDX, CDX) models. We have extensive expertise in next generation sequencing (NGS) approaches and functional analysis of cancer biology. We will use our GEMMs to dissect the gene-gene and gene-environment interactions on melanoma development and progression, and to study responses to immunotherapies to guide optimisation of these drugs in the clinic. We will develop and study GEMMs of uveal melanoma and prostate cancer, which, coupled with analysis of patient samples, will allow us to identify novel targets and develop or optimise much-needed new therapeutic approaches for these cancers. Using patient-derived models, we will identify new therapeutic targets for melanoma and other cancers, and investigate mechanisms of resistance, allowing us to develop precision medicine approaches for melanoma and other cancers, and to develop new anti-cancer drugs. Impact: Our philosophy is that patient care should be based on improved knowledge of cancer biology. Our overarching aim is to understand the processes of cancer to develop better approaches to prevention, to develop new drugs, and to improve the clinical management of cancer patients.

Lagging behind some of the more prevalent cancer types, mutations associated with T-cell lymphomas, including those with limited treatments, have only been described within the last two years. We now propose to extend structural insights into some of the key components mutated in these cancers (such as PLCgamma) using latest developments in cryoEM and methods for mapping molecular interactions (HDX-MS) as well as to establish the exact contribution of genetic alterations to pathogenesis. Our approaches will be based on the expertise and available clinical material for two related CD4+ T-cell malignancies with different aetiology, CTCL and ATL which is virally (HTLV-1) transformed. In addition to already acquired data for bioinformatics, we also have access to primary cells from individual patients from longitudinal studies of these malignances and we obtained cell lines from ATL patients with PLCG1 mutations; for comparison, we also have Btk-inhibitor resistant cell lines with PLCG2 mutations. In these systems, we plan to assess broader genetic changes and apply gene editing (CRISPR modification) and pharmacological inhibitors to a range of components involved in TCR signalling and establish those that are critical as well as their links in pathology. Overall, we aim to identify mechanisms that contribute to oncogenesis and maintenance of malignancy and key components that can be therapeutic targets. PLC and/or other components that we identify will guide new routes to treatment. Use of pharmacological inhibitors is important in assessing potential drug targets. However, there is no reliable inhibitor that specifically targets PLC enzymes. To address this limitation, we have established a collaboration with a GSK team that will provide us with relevant material.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	617512.0	GBP

Chemotherapy is standard treatment for MUC. Although MUC is initially sensitive to chemotherapy, patients usually relapse within 6 months of completion of therapy. The outcome once relapse has occurred is very poor (median overall survival 8 months). Therefore, maintaining response to chemotherapy is an attractive goal, and a good environment for testing active single agents in MUC. ATLANTIS is a multi-arm multi-stage signal searching study. Patients will be allocated to treatment (v.s. placebo) based on biomarker expression. Aims: The study will investigate whether maintenance targeted therapy after chemotherapy, based on biomarker expression, delays time to progression and overall survival for patients with MUC. Methods: This will be a double blind randomised multi-arm randomised control, multi-centre study with the potential for the addition of new arms. The intention is that positive arms will graduate from phase II to phase III testing; the phase II outcome data may be incorporated in the phase III study. Consent for biomarker testing will take place while patients are receiving first line chemotherapy for UC. Archival tumour tissue will be collected and analysed for biomarker expression. Biomarker expression will determine which sub-study the patient will enter if they are subsequently eligible for and consent to the main study. Patients who have clinical benefit after completing at least 4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy for MUC, will be assigned to cohort 1 or cohort 2 based upon the results of their biomarker analyses (AR +ve/AR –ve). Cohort 1 (Androgen Receptor (AR) +ve Patients will be randomised to receive either: Enzalutamide 160mg daily until progression or placebo daily until progression. Cohort 2 (Androgen Receptor (AR) -ve Patients will be randomised to receive either: Cabozantinib 40mg daily until progression or placebo daily until progression. Results/Analysis: All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Progression-free survival and overall survival will be compared between the study arms in the context of a Cox model incorporating the baseline minimisation factors. At the end of the study if the observed PFS difference in favour of the experimental arm is statistically significant at 10% this will be a clear signal that a subsequent phase III study is warranted.

However as we enter the era of precision medicine, poor representation of some cancer types, insufficient numbers to capture the genetic diversity of cancer, lack of clinical outcome data and lack of comparison to normal reference sample limit their use. Novel cell culturing methods such as organoid derivation have revolutionised our ability to derive cell line models from both healthy and diseased tissue, and have the potential to overcome these limitations. We intend to create new cancer organoid cell line models from multiple tumour types as an experimental tool. These cell lines will be characterised at the level of the genome and transcriptome, profiled for differential response to anti-cancer therapies, and made available to the research community. We anticipate that this highly annotated resource will have broad applications and serve to catalyse a new wave of discovery in fundamental cancer biology and therapeutics.

To tackle the increasing incidence and high mortality of breast cancer in Kenya, this pump-priming award would develop a new UK-Kenya partnership to investigate the molecular epidemiology of breast cancer. Building off a recently funded grant by the Kenya National Research Fund by co-investigator PI: F. Makhoka--Genomic Approaches for Understanding Breast Cancer Progression in Kenyan Patients--this proposal would enhance success of this work by providing key research staff and contemporary methodologies for molecular assays. Specific aims are: 1) Develop a new partnership between the University of Edinburgh and Mount Kenya University. PI: Dr. J. Figueroa has over a decade of experience in molecular epidemiology and pathology studies of breast cancer, including conduct of a large multidisciplinary study in Ghana, west Africa (Brinton...Figueroa International Journal Cancer 2017) . 2) Design data collection pipelines for molecular pathology studies of breast cancer and mortality outcomes--which are desperately needed to inform what the key barriers and challenges are for breast cancer surveillance, diagnosis and treatment. 3) Exchange knowledge of contemporary molecular subtyping methods for breast cancer, and perform a pilot study to assess whether we can collect and quantify cell free DNA (cfDNA) tumour fraction at the time of breast cancer diagnosis and the relationships with clinics-pathological characteristics of breast cancer tumours for (N=100 cases)-for potential earlier diagnosis of breast cancer. 4) Using pilot data collected in this study, engage key stakeholders (e.g. physicians, ministry of health, policy makers) to prioritise the key areas needed for long term planning to enhance capacity to tackle the increasing burden of breast cancer in Kenya	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	163567.0	GBP
92	Josefina Bastiaansen	University of Lausanne	Centre d'Imagerie BioMédicale (CIBM) CHUV	2017-09-01	2020-08-31	Translational hyperpolarized metabolic imaging of the heart for the quantification of metabolic changes in chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity	Cancer treatment containing doxorubicin can have irreversible side effects that lead to heart failure. Substantial evidence suggests that early-onset metabolic changes precede cardiac dysfunction, and that improving mitochondrial activity may better protect the heart against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (DC). Several food supplements are suspected to boost mitochondrial metabolic activity, but it is unknown whether they avert the chemotherapy-induced metabolic changes. Knowledge of such changes could lead to a better understanding of DC that might improve cancer treatment and outcome. However, no means have been available to detect such metabolic changes in vivo.Recently, hyperpolarized (HP) magnetic resonance (MR) technology demonstrated the measurement of real-time metabolic activity in vivo after the injection of HP 13C labeled metabolites. Using HP metabolic imaging, early onset metabolic changes were visualized in a diseased large animal model, and the technology was translated to image prostate cancer in patients in 2013. A significant hurdle in the clinical translation of HP MR is the presence of toxic free radicals that necessitates a time-consuming filtration process. However, exciting recent findings showed that HP metabolic imaging of pure, radical-free metabolite solutions is possible.In this proposal, the researcher will develop novel “radical-free” HP MR technology for metabolic imaging in vivo using advanced image reconstruction methods. She will establish a link between in vivo metabolic changes and the level of DC, and investigate whether this damage can be prevented with novel food supplements. HP MR enables the real-time measurement of biochemical processes, which has never been possible before. If heart failure progression in DC can be monitored with HP MR, and averted, this would improve the understanding of cardiotoxic mechanisms and support the design of precision medicine through strategies aimed at minimizing cardiotoxicity, knowledge that can be translated to patients or even allow for individualized therapy. The proposed study is novel because the hyperpolarization of metabolites without adding radicals is revolutionary, and the application of CS to metabolic imaging of the heart is innovative. This will be the first study to develop radical-free HP metabolic imaging for the heart, and the first to identify and quantify the in vivo metabolic biomarkers associated with DC. Furthermore we will establish the cardioprotective effect of NR.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Ambizione	597056.0	CHF
93	Peter Johannes Wild	University of Zurich	Institut für Klinische Pathologie Departement für Pathologie Universitätsspital Zürich	2017-02-01	2019-01-31	Digital Cancer Biobank - zBioLink	The recent dramatic success of immune checkpoint inhibitors has been a long awaited revolution in cancer treatment. Combined with the broad adoption of next-generation-sequencing (NGS) and functional drug screening techniques, the face of biomedical research is changing rapidly. In the future, routine molecular analysis and in vitro pharmacological testing will support patient-tailored therapies. But our understanding of how particular features in high-dimensional datasets contribute to or predict therapeutic response is still in its infancy. Thus, the current proposal is intended to link various biobanks at the University Hospital Zürich (USZ) to follow-up on an initial study by the group of Prof. Mitch Levesque (co-leader of this proposal) that identified a significant predictive biomarker of response to both currently available immune checkpoint inhibitors in melanoma (anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1).Clinical cancer specimens are unique and finite. They are also a critical foundation for precision medicine (PM). In general, clinical specimens such as blood, tissue or cell samples are annotated and stored in biospecimen banks (biobanks) that are typically associated with and maintained by a specific clinical center. In this interdisciplinary BioLink project, we propose to generate a digital biobank of melanoma specimens and living cells by linking the resources of at least two departments (Dept. of Dermatology & Pathology, and potentially Oncology and Hematology), where the genomic and pharmacological information is recorded and presented in searchable, digital files that are stored with the clinical metadata in a database. This pioneering project builds on a worldwide unique collection of tissue specimens and data acquisition techniques present in Zürich. It has the potential to transform PM by making data that represents the quantitative molecular and functional makeup of clinical samples accessible for research. This project will address the urgent clinical need of establishing a better stratification of metastatic melanoma patients for the most efficacious therapy. This will be based on the methods developed by the group of Prof. Levesque and recently presented at ASCO 2016. But in order to validate and expand their findings, it is necessary to gather the relevant data and samples from the USZ in three well-defined steps. The first is to establish the laboratory information system SLims (Genohm SA, Lausanne) by linking two established physical tissue and cell biobanks at the University Hospital Zürich (Dept. of Pathology and Dermatology), the second is to establish database capabilities, data analytics, and visualization tools (cBioPortal, The Hyve, Cambridge, USA) to support in silico research with the available genomic and clinical/phenotypic metadata, and the third is to define personalized, rationally chosen treatment regimens for each individual melanoma patient to prolong life after ex vivo pharmacologic testing of melanoma cells (precision medicine).We will meet these important challenges through the development and the implementation of a new, integrated strategy that is focused on the combined analysis of immune signatures and genetics as well as all available clinical parameters. Our two-year project will be initiated and made feasible by focusing on malignant melanoma and builds on the results and advances achieved by the project team. In the past, the applicants have successfully established facilities to convert physical specimens into digital files representing their genomic states. A pilot program of a carefully selected set of 150 specimens will be carried out, comparing features of tumors and matching living cells. Specifically, the unique technical capabilities and resources the project team will bring to bear on melanoma include 1) unique, annotated clinical tissue and cell resources including the two largest cancer tissue and cell biobanks in Switzerland, 2) technologies to generate genetic barcodes and drug response data of melanoma samples in a high-throughput manner, 3) a novel framework (Oracle Translational Research Center Platform) for linking metadata in the clinic, and 4) (bio-) informatics tools to define and visualize the networks perturbed in melanoma. Associated challenges will be solved by the development of a digital biobank application, using the cBioPortal software (The Hyve, Cambridge) that visualizes different biobanking initiatives. Another result and unique feature of the project will be the prospective generation of a digital biobank sui generis for all types of disease, called zBioLink. Besides conventional tissue and cell samples, sequencing results will be systematically collected and integrated with clinical outcome information and pharmacological in vitro data. The project will extend the current histopathological and genetic characterization of cancer tissue to the level of functional drug response data. In addition, the zBioLink project will establish a general framework for bringing basic research discoveries to the clinics for patients’ benefit and provide an environment for clinical and basic scientists to collaborate efficiently. The project team has already implemented a tumor-board in molecular-oncology and immuno-oncology at the University Hospital Zürich, where selected patients from the pilot study with metastatic disease can be discussed. Access to data will be provided by the Research Data Service Center, USZ. The project will democratize precision medicine research by linking these efforts and presenting the data of tissues and living cells in a graphical user interface (zBioLink). Linked biobank databases of this scale will facilitate the realization of systems medicine as a milestone on the way to an effective PM program that enables the identification of predictive biomarkers and potential drug targets across large cohorts of cancer patients. We anticipate that the project will be completed within two years. Alignment with national initiatives (Swiss Biobanking Platform, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics) is intended to allow for collaborations and harmonization of standards across Switzerland.

NASH is associated with obesity and intestinal dysbiosis, i.e., a change in the microbiota linked to disease, and translocation of bacterial products. Thus, the intestinal barrier has an important role in keeping bacteria at a distance to the host. Regenerating islet-derived protein (Reg) 3 lectins are antimicrobial molecules that are secreted by intestinal epithelial cells and Paneth cells as part of the innate immunity, and maintain sterility of the inner mucus layer. Reg3ß and Reg3? are almost exclusively expressed in the small intestine, but not in the liver or immune cells. Reg3 lectins are regulated by interleukin (IL)-22, which is mainly released by intestinal innate lymphoid cells (ILC3). The absence of Reg3 lectins promotes translocation of viable bacteria and alcoholic liver disease. In NASH, this interrelation has not yet been investigated. Hypotheses: Fast-food diet reduces expression of Reg3 lectins in the small intestine of mice by lower IL-22 expression. This promotes translocation of viable bacteria and hepatic features of NASH. Intestinal overexpression of Reg3? will prevent NASH. Humans with NASH are thought to have lower intestinal Reg3 expression than patients with NAFLD or normal weight controls. The proposed study will investigate the role of Reg3ß and ? on the pathogenesis of NASH. Molecular mechanisms were investigated in mouse models during an advanced postdoc mobility fellowship at the University of California San Diego. To test the relevance of Reg3 lectins in humans is part of a return phase fellowship in Switzerland. In patients with NASH and NAFLD the expression pattern of intestinal lectins along the small intestine will be investigated. Future directions/Outlook: Reg3 lectins can be regarded as endogenous antibiotics. If the project reveals that Reg3 expression is reduced in NASH, and this correlates to increased hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis, this would add significantly to the importance of the gut-liver axis. Moreover, strategies that aim at inducing IL-22/Reg3 lectins might become an integral part of precision medicine in liver disease.

Patients will be classified using data-driven phenotyping algorithm using their so-far-complete healthcare trajectory. Patients' linked electronic health records (EHR) including primary and secondary care data as well as socio-economic and mortality data will be utilised collected from diverse sources such as Barts Health Data Warehouse, NHS Discovery Project East London, CPRD and NCRAS. The PaC events (incidence, recurrence, death) and comparison of these to rates in matched controls will be estimated using appropriate statistical models. Association between various exposures and outcomes will be measured in terms of odds ratios, with length and dose of exposure to known risk factors as stratification categories. Objective 2: The -omics data available through cancer-specific initiatives (TCGA, GENIE) as well as molecular data repositories (GEO, ArrayExpress) will be analysed in combination with relevant literature mining to collate existing genomic characterisations of PaC in terms of gene/mutational signatures. The assessment of molecular characteristics of PaC associated to clinical history will be conducted on data derived from PCRF Tissue Bank. Consensus clustering algorithm will be applied to obtain new stratifications of PaC along the themes of disease onset, progression, survival and response to treatment. The association between the expression/mutational status of specific PaC genes and risk/prognostic factors, longitudinal data and response to treatment will be tested.

98	Dr Ailith Ewing	University of Edinburgh	MRC Human Genetics Unit	2018-02-01	2021-01-31	Precision medicine and the mutational landscape of high grade serous ovarian cancer	High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) makes up 75% of new diagnoses of ovarian cancer in Scotland and is almost always diagnosed after the disease has spread. As a result, the 5-year overall survival rate remains low at around 40%. HGSOC is characterised by ubiquitous somatic TP53 mutations and elevated rates of structural variants (SVs) which are thought to drive tumourigenesis. However, HGSOC is poorly understood at the genomic level and the number of available samples is modest. We will analyse high quality whole genome sequencing (WGS) data emerging from a large study of HGSOC (led by Prof. Gourley and co-funded by AstraZeneca) in 200 Scottish patients. Detailed histopathological and clinical data are available for these patients through the Edinburgh Ovarian Cancer Database (Gourley). Using this resource, we will examine the origins and consequences of the somatic mutational landscape of HGSOC. We will calculate mutational spectra in HGSOC WGS samples, as has been done for breast cancer (Nik-Zainal et al, Cell, 2012), and explore their utility in predicting clinical variables, including disease progression and therapeutic responses. We will investigate the role of germline genetic variation in determining mutational spectra and other tumour signatures, such as gene expression signatures, using association testing. The generalisability of our observations will be established by integrating our data with previously published HGSOC WGS data (Patch et al, Nature, 2015) and associated clinical data. We will explore the clinical utility of mutational spectra extracted from the larger cohort (N=450) of FFPE samples. Developing analyses for large collections of FFPE samples may have broader translational impact across oncology globally. We will investigate the utility of newly identified complex SVs in HGSOC in patient stratification as well as investigating the predictive power gained from including these variants in mutational spectra.

Metformin is the first-line drug in clinical guidelines, but choosing between the four second-line therapy options (sulfonylureas, SGLT2-inhibitors, DPP4-inhibitors and pioglitazone) is a major clinical dilemma. This project will build on recent work that has robustly demonstrated that routinely measured clinical characteristics such as sex and BMI are associated with differential glucose-lowering response to the four second-line drug options. We will use routine primary care data from the UK (Clinical Practice Research Datalink, n&gt;140,000) and existing clinical trial data (30 randomised trials, 45,000 participants) to develop and validate a treatment selection model to select the optimal glucose-lowering medication after metformin for an individual with type 2 diabetes based on their clinical characteristics. We will also modify the model, based on randomised clinical trial data suggesting SGLT2-inhibitors should be prescribed in all individuals with pre-existing vascular disease or albuminuria. We will use data science approaches to test the models in routine and trial data, and evaluate the impact of using the models on cardiovascular outcomes.

Specific objectives: 1) Characterisation of the cellular role of ATP13A3; 2) Functional assessment of domain-specific ATP13A3 mutations; 3) Identification and validation of novel interacting protein partners. Background: PAH is a devastating cardiovascular disease with genetic heterogeneity. Mutation of the TGF-beta receptor BMPR2 is the major heritable risk factor, yet next-generation sequencing has expanded the genetic landscape of idiopathic disease, highlighting novel pathways with potential for precision medicine intervention. Using whole-genome sequencing in 1,038 PAH subjects, we detected an enrichment of rare deleterious variation in ATP13A3, a poorly characterised P-type ATPase, hypothesized to play a role in polyamine transport. We demonstrated that ATP13A3 knock-down led to dysregulated endothelial cell apoptosis and proliferation, consistent with hallmark PAH cellular features. Hypothesis: ATP13A3 functions in the polyamine transport system and facilitates protein trafficking via the caveolin-dependent endocytic pathway. In PAH, identified ATP13A3 mutations clustered within the intracellular phosphorylation (P-) domain abrogate ATPase catalytic activity. Methodology: Using siRNA knock-down, metabolomics and enzyme-coupled ATPase assays, the metabolome and enzymatic activity of ATP13A3-deficient pulmonary vascular cells will be assessed relative to wild-type. To investigate the ATP13A3 protein interaction network, yeast two-hybrid assay will be performed using the P-domain as bait. Direct interactions will be validated by GST-pulldown, co-immunoprecipitation and intracellular co-localisation assays. Anticipated benefits: Delineation of the ATP13A3-related pathways regulating pulmonary vasculature maintenance will improve fundamental understanding of ATP13A3 biology and support the development of a model system for prospective drug discovery.

103	Dr Brian Halliday	Imperial College London	None	2019-08-01	2021-08-01	Using metabolomics as part of a precision medicine strategy to identify signatures of myocardial recovery	Aims (i) To characterise the metabolomic signature of patients with recovered dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) who: - were in remission and who relapsed after therapy withdrawal (20 pts with 3 serial samples). - had sustained recovery after therapy withdrawal (30 pts with 3 serial samples). - had sustained recovery on continued therapy (26 pts with 3 serial samples). (ii) To characterise the metabolomic signature of recovered DCM and compare this with healthy volunteers* and DCM with persistent dysfunction*. (data available from parallel projects) TRED-HF demonstrated that 40% of patients with recovered DCM, relapsed following heart failure therapy withdrawal. Techniques which distinguish recovery from remission are required. Systemic metabolic dysfunction is a common feature of heart failure, resulting from interactions between the myocardium and peripheral tissues. Profiling of circulating metabolites by 1H NMR and MS, known as metabolomics, demonstrates that insulin resistance, impaired oxidative metabolism and a shift towards catabolic rather than anabolic pathways are important features of heart failure. Heart failure patients who recover typically demonstrate improved metabolic function, however this is often incomplete. It is possible that the degree of recovery in metabolic function predicts the likelihood of relapse. Metabolomics may enable more accurate characterisation of remission and recovery. We will characterise the circulating metabolome of participants in TRED-HF at serial time points. By comparing the metabolome of patients who relapsed following therapy withdrawal with those who had sustained recovery, we hope to discover signatures of remission with subsequent relapse and sustained recovery.

104	Dr James Ware	MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences	None	2015-10-01	2021-03-31	Cardiovascular Genomics and Precision Medicine	The group’s overarching research aims are to understand the impact of genetic variation on the heart and circulation, and to use genome information to improve patient care. Several research themes contribute to these aims: Gene discovery in rare cardiovascular disease – we are using exome and genome sequencing approaches in humans to find genes that cause rare Mendelian disease, particularly severe childhood cardiomyopathies (heart muscle diseases), both to provide answers to the families affected, and also to find new therapeutic targets for the treatment of these conditions. Having identified candidate disease genes through sequencing in humans, we are using genome engineering in stem-cell derived cardiomyocytes to further characterise the role of these genes in the heart, to determine mechanisms of pathogenicity, and to identify targets for therapeutic modulation. Variant interpretation – all of us carry rare variants that alter important genes. Distinguishing between those that cause disease and those that are innocent bystanders is a key challenge in contemporary clinical genetics. We are developing and applying new methods to address this challenge, and collaborating globally to refine our understanding of variation in genes associated with heart disease. We are aggregating large cohorts of subjects with inherited cardiac conditions (mainly cardiomyopathies) and reference samples both locally and through collaboration (e.g. the NIHR Royal Brompton Cardiovascular BRU BioBank, the Exome Aggregation Consortium, the Clinical Genome Resource, Genomics England, Oxford Molecular Genetics Laboratory, Laboratory for Molecular Medicine at Partners Healthcare, the SHaRe Cardiomyopathy Registry, the NIHR Rare Diseases Translational Research Collaboration) to develop and evaluate new computational methods. Precision medicine – we are evaluating the use of genetics and biomarkers to stratify patients and predict their response to therapy and long-term outcomes. Ultimately, we are working to interpret genome information so that it can be used to optimise treatment choice for our patients. We are particularly focusing on genetic stratification of cohorts with hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies. We integrate genetics, biomarkers, and precision phenotyping with electronic medical records and clinical outcome data to identify determinants of prognosis and treatment response. Titin – we have a particular focus on the Titin gene, which encodes the largest human protein, a key component of muscles throughout the body. Recently identified as the most important cause of inherited dilated cardiomyopathy, we are working to understand the effects of Titin variants on the heart, their mechanisms of action, and their clinical significance. Our group focuses on computational approaches and statistical genetics in human subjects, and we integrate these data with genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and physiological data from model organisms and cellular models through collaboration within and without the MRC Clinical Sciences Centre.

Research Plan ICR-CTSU will work with key clinical and scientific opinion leaders to design, conduct and analyse clinical trials based on cutting edge research aiming to impact clinical practice worldwide. Strong quality management systems will underpin effective and efficient trial conduct. ICR-CTSU will deliver a cohesive programme of trials within focussed areas whilst developing new partnerships in others. Specific aims are: In systemic treatment of breast cancer ?Develop biomarker-driven trial platforms, incorporate surrogate endpoints for peri-operative/neoadjuvant trials and explore their potential for use in the adjuvant setting. ?Lead and/or collaborate within target-oriented and pragmatic national/international trials to further refine treatment. In systemic treatment of urological cancers ?Develop randomised phase II/III trials to define treatment strategies for metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer, incorporating biomarkers for patient selection and/or early assessment of response. ?Develop trials in the surgical urology setting, with a focus on non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. In radiotherapy, across portfolios (breast, urological and head & neck cancers) ?Deliver a coordinated programme of national trials optimising radiotherapy delivery and harnessing contemporary technologies. ?Explore relationships between efficacy and safety outcomes, aiming to personalise treatment by identifying factors predicting radiosensitivity and target radiotherapy to those with greatest clinical need. In other (rare) cancers ?Evaluate novel targeted therapies, with strategic involvement in international rare cancer initiatives, maximising opportunities for integrated translational research. How results will be used ICR-CTSU trials have changed clinical practice.

(http://www.cancercentre.ox.ac.uk) The vision of the Centre spans the research spectrum – from fundamental sciences through the translational pipeline and into clinical care with outputs feeding back into a cycle of discovery. To deliver this vision, we have focused our activity in key themes with our investments emphasising support for translational activity. We seek to partner with other funding bodies to continue to develop our fundamental sciences and deliver our clinical trials portfolio. We also pursue collaborative opportunities with other institutions across the UK and internationally to support our research objectives. As a CRUK-funded Centre we are committed to complimenting the priorities of CRUK’s new research strategy; looking for new opportunities to support their vision to beat cancer sooner. Research Strategy The Centre focuses on its strengths in radiotherapy and early phase trials in small cohorts of molecularly stratified patients, seeking novel combinations of treatments and utilisation of cutting edge technologies. We are expanding the definition of ‘personalisation of treatment’: interlinking specific molecular and genetic patient data with functional imaging to select the most effective experimental combination of surgical, radiotherapy and systemic interventions. We are committed to delivering this vision of precision medicine, through the Precision Cancer Medicine Institute (PCMI). To achieve this bold ambition we must draw from the broad range of expertise Oxford provides; from mathematicians to surgeons, chemists to epidemiologists, biologists to medical oncologists. We will work with scientists and clinicians from a variety of disciplines and not allow traditional boundaries to prevent new collaborations. We also foster networking in the Centre creating an ongoing dialogue across our wide ranging membership, leading to collaborations with help research realise its clinical impact. Scientific Areas of Interest Our disease sites of interest reflect the breadth and depth of activity here in Oxford. We have well established programmes in breast, melanoma, colorectal, urological, sarcoma, ovarian and blood cancers, where our work integrates internal research activity from across a range of disciplines to engage or lead in national and international networks. We aim to further expand our programmes in oesophageal, pancreas, brain and lung cancers through further investment in recruitment, support of our strategic working groups and engagement with national research networks. We see these as critical areas of focus for the future; to apply our world leading research to areas which can have significant impact for patients and to support CRUK’s ambition of addressing areas of unmet need. We are also expanding our scientific focus to include emerging areas of interest including tumour immunology, clinical informatics and proton beam therapy. Other Areas of Activity We invest in underpinning platforms of support which span the breadth of our cancer research community. Schemes such as the Development Fund, our networking events and working groups, and the Centre’s Annual Symposium provide the springboard for new ideas and innovations to be launched. All members across the Centre have access to these activities, which offer the opportunity for new connections, deeper collaborations and research innovation. We also foster a culture of engagement to enable Oxford’s science and CRUK’s investment to reach a wider audience. We believe that inspiring people with our research can bring hope that beating cancer is within reach. Finally, our training programme for the Centre’s clinical and non-clinical students takes full advantage of the enriched training environment that Oxford provides and enables us to recruit the best trainees, who we hope will go on to become our future leaders. For the future, we aim to continue to raising Oxford’s national and international reputation for cancer research; driving the research agenda and delivering world-class research which will be of benefit to patients.

As a consequence, HIV-infected individuals live longer and become older. Besides therapeutic effectiveness, drug tolerability and long term health impact become key issues for treatments to be taken indefinitely. Moroever, aging patients encounter chronic conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular problems, diabetes, neurocognitive impairement and malignancies, which lead to increasingly complex drugs associations with a high potential of drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Moreover, renal and hepatic functions become altered in a fraction of patients, necessitating appropriate treatment adjustments. Thus, HIV infection management becomes increasingly complex, not to mention metabolic complications and other cumulative deleterious effects of ARTs over decades. In addition, a significant percentage of HIV patients (up to 30% in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, SHCS) are co-infected with hepatitis C virus and are likely to receive the last wave of anti-HCV drugs. Still their drug interaction potential, notably with ARTs, and their long-term safety are incompletely characterized. More generally, most information from DDI databases used by healthcare providers is extrapolated from current knowledge of drug metabolic pathways identified in vitro, which poorly account for the complexity of multiple and opposing in vivo effects, not to mention induction or pharmacogenetic issues. In the growing movement of personalized medicine, research efforts must be pursued to improve the prescription of ARTs not only with regard to antiretroviral efficacy but also according to tolerability, long-term safety and potential DDIs, possibly modulated by patients’ pharmacogenetics traits. These issues will be best addressed by an integrated strategy of drug selection and dosage individualization based on relevant demographic/clinical factors, genetic markers (precision medicine) and measurement of circulating concentrations (Therapeutic Drug Monitoring, TDM). To this end, during the last funding period, we have:1.Developped mass spectrometry assays for the TDM of new anti-HIV and anti-HCV drugs, as well as metabolites profiles analysis in various body compartments. 2.Extended our modelling expertise from single-drug population pharmacokinetic analysis to drug-drug and drug-gene interactions studies and to the kinetics of biological markers in patients from the SHCS.3.Established a logistical framework for the prospective capture of TDM data for novel anti-HIV and anti-HCV agents. Building up on our population mass spectrometry facilities, modeling expertise and established frameworks, we intend to launch a systematic analysis of complex drug-drug interactions relevant to antiviral treatments and comedication in patients infected by HIV and/or HCV. Specifically, we propose in the present request for grant renewal: 1.Large-scale, cross-sectional capture, at the occasion of the bi-annual cohort visit of SHCS patients, of TDM samples along with relevant therapeutic information (date/time of last dose and blood sampling), not only for antiviral treatments but also for all other drugs part of their co-medication (i.e. statins, cardiovascular and psychotropic drugs, anticancer agents, etc.) 2. Multiplex mass spectrometry analyses of antiviral drugs and relevant comedication in TDM samples. 3.Population kinetic modeling of the exposure to antiviral drugs and to selected comedication in genotyped SHCS patients, which will culminate to:4. Nested case-control and network analyses of drugs-drug interactions observed in active SHCS individuals in real-life conditions, followed by model-based simulations and formal small-scale validation studies of problematic drug interactions. The major strength of this proposal is to address two key issues in current therapeutics of HIV- and/or HCV-infected patients: the complexity and the long-term consequences of treatments. This pharmacokinetic-pharmacoepidemiologic analysis will contribute to personalize drug treatment (via both pharmacogenetics and TDM) while addressing the problem of DDIs actually encountered in real-life conditions	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (special)	430500.0	CHF

NASH is associated with obesity and intestinal dysbiosis, i.e., a change in the microbiota linked to disease, and translocation of bacterial products. Activation of toll-like receptors by components of the outer bacterial membrane leads to release of tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) and activation of hepatic TNFa receptors (TNFR), which drives the pathogenesis of NASH. Thus, the intestinal barrier has an important role in keeping bacteria at a distance to the host. Regenerating islet-derived protein (Reg) 3 lectins are antimicrobial molecules that are secreted by intestinal epithelial cells and Paneth cells as part of the innate immunity, and maintain sterility of the inner mucus layer. Reg3b and Reg3g are almost exclusively expressed in the small intestine, but not in the liver or immune cells. Reg3 lectins are regulated by interleukin (IL)-22, which is mainly released by intestinal innate lymphoid cells (ILC3). The absence of Reg3 lectins promotes translocation of viable bacteria and alcoholic liver disease. In NASH, this interrelation has not yet been investigated. Preliminary data: Pilot experiments showed that after 20 weeks of high-cholesterol, high-fructose diet (also termed fast food diet, FFD) Reg3g expression in the duodenum of C57BL/6 mice was reduced. FFD induced liver fibrosis in wild-type (WT) mice, which appeared to be worse in the absence of Reg3b, i.e. in knock-out (KO) mice. Reg3b KO mice had higher ALT levels than WT mice. Hypotheses: Based on these pilot data we hypothesize that FFD reduces expression of Reg3b and Reg3g in the small intestine of mice by lower IL-22 expression. This promotes translocation of viable bacteria and hepatic features of NASH through activation of hepatic TNFR1. Intestinal overexpression of Reg3g and abrogated hepatic TNFR1 signaling will prevent NASH, thus proving that bacteria-mediated release of TNFa in the setting of downregulated Reg3 lectins contributes to NASH. Humans with NASH are thought to have lower intestinal Reg3 expression than patients with NAFLD or normal weight controls. Specific aims: The proposed study will investigate the role of Reg3b and g on the pathogenesis of NASH. In aim 1, the effect of feeding a FFD for 20 weeks on intestinal Reg3 expression in C57BL/6 WT mice will be assessed. The role of IL-22 secreting ILC3 will be investigated to explain the findings. In aim 2, the role of Reg3b and g on dysbiosis, bacterial translocation, endotoxemia, liver inflammation and fibrosis will be investigated in mice lacking intestinal Reg3b and g expression as well as mice overexpressing intestinal Reg3g. Aim 3 will confirm the role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of NASH using mice lacking both, intestinal Reg3 lectins and TNFR1 specifically in hepatocytes. Aim 4 will investigate the expression pattern of intestinal lectins, IL-22 and lymphocytes along the small intestine in patients with NASH and NAFLD to confirm relevance of findings from aim 1-3 in humans. Future directions/Outlook: Reg3 lectins can be regarded as endogenous antibiotics. If the project reveals that Reg3 expression is reduced in NASH, and this correlates to increased hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis, this would add significantly to the importance of the gut-liver axis. Moreover, strategies that aim at inducing IL-22/Reg3 lectins might become an integral part of precision medicine in liver disease.

Our lack of knowledge on the functional consequences of the vast majority of genetic variation is one of the fundamental problems impeding such endeavors. While naturally occurring variants have the most relevance for explaining phenotypic diversity, systematic genome perturbations have primarily been focused on large-effect alleles, such as gene deletions. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping have addressed the role of natural variation in conditioning complex traits, but these approaches are limited by the haplotypes present in the population and are poorly equipped to detect interactions between loci - situations where the effect of one variant is masked or enhanced by another variant. It has become clear that a comprehensive view of genetic variation and its role in shaping phenotypes requires systematic perturbation of each variant in different genetic and environmental contexts. Recent advances in genome engineering now make such an approach possible. Here I propose to systematically engineer and phenotype naturally occurring single nucleotide variants and small insertion-deletion polymorphisms in three distinct Saccharomyces cerevisiae backgrounds. The strains will be constructed by a high-throughput CRISPR approach that allows creation of thousands of barcoded and sequence-verified variant strains simultaneously. I will profile strain pools in multiple environments, identifying those variants that modulate fitness in a given environment and genetic background by next-generation sequencing of genomically integrated DNA barcodes. To map pairwise and higher-order interactions I will then directly engineer variant combinations and assay their impact on cellular processes and fitness. The work in this proposal will be an important contribution towards understanding the phenotypic landscape governed by natural variants and their interaction with each other and the environment. Due to the conservation of fundamental cellular processes, the here identified principles underlying allelic interactions will allow valuable insights into the organizing principles of cellular systems. By enabling the interpretation of genetic variation in specific biological and environmental contexts these insights lay the foundation for efforts to predict the phenotype of a cell based on its genotype and environment alone.

Early detection and preventive treatment of aneurysms fall short as we do not know who is it at risk and why, as we have insufficient insight in the contribution and interplay of genetic, environmental and intermediate phenotypic risk factors. Given the rarity of the disease, there is a paucity of large and rich cohorts to study risk factors separately with sufficient power. To add to the problem, my preliminary findings suggest disease heterogeneity with subgroup specific risk factors for aneurysms. The sex-related heterogeneity is most eminent in the disease with 2/3 of patients being women. I aim to advance disease understanding to allow early recognition of intracranial aneurysms to prevent ASAH. I have established a new conceptual approach that integrates genetic and environmental risk factors with imaging markers as intermediate phenotypes for genetic factors. With data reduction and machine-learning approaches I will for the first time address disease heterogeneity and aneurysm risk with adequate power. I will develop and validate a tool to automatically detect new imaging markers predicting aneurysm development applying feature-learning models. Next I will elucidate the genetic basis underlying differential imaging risk patterns (imaging genetic factors). I will apply a new hypothesis-free strategy to detect and validate yet unknown environmental risk factors predicting aneurysm presence. I will assess the contribution to disease of all factors detected according to sex. All risk factors will be combined in an aneurysm prediction risk model to understand relative contribution of different risk factors in different subgroups. It will advance disease understanding and individualized risk prediction of aneurysms leading to precision medicine in early aneurysm detection to reduce the burden of ASAH.

By embedding ratiometric fluorescent particle-based sensors within 3D scaffolds, the changes in target analyte concentrations can be monitored and used to study the interactions between tumour cells and stromal cells in 3D tumoroids/scaffolds and to monitor response of the cells to drug treatments. I first demonstrated successful fabrication of barcoded capsules for multiplex sensing of H+, K+, and Na+ ions. Next, I demonstrated the use of pH-sensing capsules as valid real time optical reporter tools to sense and monitor intracellular acidification in living cells. Thus, I can fabricate capsule sensors for investigating the role of key analytes that are involved in regulation of crucial physiological mechanisms. In addition, I successfully integrated pH-sensing capsules within 3D nanofibrous matrices and demonstrated their operation under pH switches. INTERCELLMED will engineer 3D scaffolds that do not only sense extracellular pH but are also able to sense K+ and O2 changes. To this aim, a novel set of anisotropic analyte-sensitive ratiometric capsules will be developed and applied for generating robust and flexible capsules-embedded sensing scaffolds. To validate the functions of the 3D sensing platform, cocoltures of tumour cells and stromal cells will be grown and their interaction and response to drug treatments will be studied by mapping the K+/H+/O2 gradients in and around the cell aggregates. Finally, the 3D sensing platform will be adapted for growing tumour tissue-derived cells that will be tested ex-vivo with anticancer dugs. Specific mathematical models of cellular interactions will be developed to represent the biological processes occurring within the 3D sensing platform.

Acquisition, analysis, and sharing of such data is a priority on the agenda of 2016 and beyond. In the US, a number of initiatives are taking place to coordinate and harmonize high quality collection and analysis of health data to enable precision medicine and to rationalize treatment of chronic diseases. The aim is to obtain comprehensive comparative data for evidence-based public health and health care. In order to advance smarter medicine, in the US a number of data collection initiatives exist where data from ambulatory or inpatient hospital care is collected routinely and helps to identify better measures and to answer critical questions in the clinical research agenda. Examples are the outpatient clinical registry called “Guideline Advantage (TGA)”, or the National Hospital Care Survey NHCS and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, NHAMCS. To improve evidence-based, smart health care, data from various hospitals, ambulatory care providers, researchers and insurance companies should be combined. Thus, the concept that collection and analysis of health data can remain the task of “a single investigator in a single laboratory for a single purpose” needs to be abandoned. Integrating such local and national data into a coherent network of resources and infrastructure that allows for the efficient and ethical sharing of data, as recommended by the NIH, is urgently needed in Switzerland. At present, data collecting entities tend to prefer using their own clinical or other indicators for success and outcome which is a clear weakness for the Swiss health care system. Efforts are urgently needed to improve (i.) standardization and comparability of data and indicators, (ii.) availability of data from different sources including insurance companies, (iii.) increased veracity and (iv.) completeness of data, comprising the routine collection of valid health and quality indicators. Within and across countries, collaborative acquisition and analysis of comparable health data (and biological samples) is hampered by a number of barriers. In comparison to other European countries and the US, Switzerland is lagging behind. While some barriers, such as the cantonal structure, are evident, others are yet unknown and need urgently to be assessed in more detail, in order to enable smarter health care in Switzerland. The present project will build on previous experience of the two main applicants. BE has worked on barriers to sharing concerning genetic databanks and TP is an expert in health care quality control and evaluation. The aim of this project is to provide urgently needed knowledge on how to overcome barriers to implement high quality, comparable health data collection in Switzerland. The study is at the same time an intervention towards the facilitation of smart data collection as it will not only obtain knowledge, but make key stakeholders and decision makers aware of the need for harmonized good quality data and involve them actively in the search for solutions to overcome barriers.Objectives, methods and study parts are the following:i.Identify success mechanisms, barriers and needs in Switzerland: using a literature search and theoretical analysis, we will describe factors that facilitated past success stories of harmonized health data collection in Switzerland (e.g. HIV-cohort, SAPALDIA, CHUV-biobank), analyse what is known about barriers, and identify needs in Switzerland, e.g. types of needed data, including harmonised tools and indicators used abroad and susceptible to be useful in Switzerland. This includes an assessment of legal and ethical barriers.ii.Explore success factors in other countries: semi-structured interviews will be conducted with approximately 15-25 decision makers and experts in institutions that developed efficient data collection tools in other countries, including those with health care systems comparable to Switzerland. iii.Understand decision makers and key stakeholders’ attitudes and knowledge to identify barriers and propose concrete solutions via a Delphi process: semi-structured interviews will be carried out with 20-30 hospital directors, hospital data managers, insurance company representatives and other stakeholders involved in or influencing collection of relevant data in Switzerland and 20-30 health data researchers and Swiss data experts. The Delphi approach will be concluded using a questionnaire and workshops that extend into part iv.iv.Inform and disseminate findings: this objective is already integrated in part iii. as experts and stakeholders will not only be asked about their experience and attitudes, but also informed about needs and facilitators identified in parts i. and ii. Study results will also be disseminated through the usual scientific vectors (conferences, publications etc.).v.Based on expert consensus, produce concrete, detailed and practically useful recommendations to inform policy makers how to reduce barriers and further good quality health data collection in Switzerland.

However as we enter the era of precision medicine, poor representation of some cancer types, insufficient numbers to capture the genetic diversity of cancer, lack of clinical outcome data and lack of comparison to normal reference sample limit their use. Novel cell culturing methods such as organoid derivation have revolutionised our ability to derive cell line models from both healthy and diseased tissue, and have the potential to overcome these limitations. We intend to create new cancer organoid cell line models from multiple tumour types as an experimental tool. These cell lines will be characterised at the level of the genome and transcriptome, profiled for differential response to anti-cancer therapies, and made available to the research community. We anticipate that this highly annotated resource will have broad applications and serve to catalyse a new wave of discovery in fundamental cancer biology and therapeutics.

Substantial evidence suggests that early-onset metabolic changes precede cardiac dysfunction, and that improving mitochondrial activity may better protect the heart against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (DC). Several food supplements are suspected to boost mitochondrial metabolic activity, but it is unknown whether they avert the chemotherapy-induced metabolic changes. Knowledge of such changes could lead to a better understanding of DC that might improve cancer treatment and outcome. However, no means have been available to detect such metabolic changes in vivo.Recently, hyperpolarized (HP) magnetic resonance (MR) technology demonstrated the measurement of real-time metabolic activity in vivo after the injection of HP 13C labeled metabolites. Using HP metabolic imaging, early onset metabolic changes were visualized in a diseased large animal model, and the technology was translated to image prostate cancer in patients in 2013. A significant hurdle in the clinical translation of HP MR is the presence of toxic free radicals that necessitates a time-consuming filtration process. However, exciting recent findings showed that HP metabolic imaging of pure, radical-free metabolite solutions is possible.In this proposal, the researcher will develop novel “radical-free” HP MR technology for metabolic imaging in vivo using advanced image reconstruction methods. She will establish a link between in vivo metabolic changes and the level of DC, and investigate whether this damage can be prevented with novel food supplements. HP MR enables the real-time measurement of biochemical processes, which has never been possible before. If heart failure progression in DC can be monitored with HP MR, and averted, this would improve the understanding of cardiotoxic mechanisms and support the design of precision medicine through strategies aimed at minimizing cardiotoxicity, knowledge that can be translated to patients or even allow for individualized therapy. The proposed study is novel because the hyperpolarization of metabolites without adding radicals is revolutionary, and the application of CS to metabolic imaging of the heart is innovative. This will be the first study to develop radical-free HP metabolic imaging for the heart, and the first to identify and quantify the in vivo metabolic biomarkers associated with DC. Furthermore we will establish the cardioprotective effect of NR.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Ambizione	597056.0	CHF
120	Peter Johannes Wild	University of Zurich	Institut für Klinische Pathologie Departement für Pathologie Universitätsspital Zürich	2017-02-01	2019-01-31	Digital Cancer Biobank - zBioLink	The recent dramatic success of immune checkpoint inhibitors has been a long awaited revolution in cancer treatment. Combined with the broad adoption of next-generation-sequencing (NGS) and functional drug screening techniques, the face of biomedical research is changing rapidly. In the future, routine molecular analysis and in vitro pharmacological testing will support patient-tailored therapies. But our understanding of how particular features in high-dimensional datasets contribute to or predict therapeutic response is still in its infancy. Thus, the current proposal is intended to link various biobanks at the University Hospital Zürich (USZ) to follow-up on an initial study by the group of Prof. Mitch Levesque (co-leader of this proposal) that identified a significant predictive biomarker of response to both currently available immune checkpoint inhibitors in melanoma (anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1).Clinical cancer specimens are unique and finite. They are also a critical foundation for precision medicine (PM). In general, clinical specimens such as blood, tissue or cell samples are annotated and stored in biospecimen banks (biobanks) that are typically associated with and maintained by a specific clinical center. In this interdisciplinary BioLink project, we propose to generate a digital biobank of melanoma specimens and living cells by linking the resources of at least two departments (Dept. of Dermatology & Pathology, and potentially Oncology and Hematology), where the genomic and pharmacological information is recorded and presented in searchable, digital files that are stored with the clinical metadata in a database. This pioneering project builds on a worldwide unique collection of tissue specimens and data acquisition techniques present in Zürich. It has the potential to transform PM by making data that represents the quantitative molecular and functional makeup of clinical samples accessible for research. This project will address the urgent clinical need of establishing a better stratification of metastatic melanoma patients for the most efficacious therapy. This will be based on the methods developed by the group of Prof. Levesque and recently presented at ASCO 2016. But in order to validate and expand their findings, it is necessary to gather the relevant data and samples from the USZ in three well-defined steps. The first is to establish the laboratory information system SLims (Genohm SA, Lausanne) by linking two established physical tissue and cell biobanks at the University Hospital Zürich (Dept. of Pathology and Dermatology), the second is to establish database capabilities, data analytics, and visualization tools (cBioPortal, The Hyve, Cambridge, USA) to support in silico research with the available genomic and clinical/phenotypic metadata, and the third is to define personalized, rationally chosen treatment regimens for each individual melanoma patient to prolong life after ex vivo pharmacologic testing of melanoma cells (precision medicine).We will meet these important challenges through the development and the implementation of a new, integrated strategy that is focused on the combined analysis of immune signatures and genetics as well as all available clinical parameters. Our two-year project will be initiated and made feasible by focusing on malignant melanoma and builds on the results and advances achieved by the project team. In the past, the applicants have successfully established facilities to convert physical specimens into digital files representing their genomic states. A pilot program of a carefully selected set of 150 specimens will be carried out, comparing features of tumors and matching living cells. Specifically, the unique technical capabilities and resources the project team will bring to bear on melanoma include 1) unique, annotated clinical tissue and cell resources including the two largest cancer tissue and cell biobanks in Switzerland, 2) technologies to generate genetic barcodes and drug response data of melanoma samples in a high-throughput manner, 3) a novel framework (Oracle Translational Research Center Platform) for linking metadata in the clinic, and 4) (bio-) informatics tools to define and visualize the networks perturbed in melanoma. Associated challenges will be solved by the development of a digital biobank application, using the cBioPortal software (The Hyve, Cambridge) that visualizes different biobanking initiatives. Another result and unique feature of the project will be the prospective generation of a digital biobank sui generis for all types of disease, called zBioLink. Besides conventional tissue and cell samples, sequencing results will be systematically collected and integrated with clinical outcome information and pharmacological in vitro data. The project will extend the current histopathological and genetic characterization of cancer tissue to the level of functional drug response data. In addition, the zBioLink project will establish a general framework for bringing basic research discoveries to the clinics for patients’ benefit and provide an environment for clinical and basic scientists to collaborate efficiently. The project team has already implemented a tumor-board in molecular-oncology and immuno-oncology at the University Hospital Zürich, where selected patients from the pilot study with metastatic disease can be discussed. Access to data will be provided by the Research Data Service Center, USZ. The project will democratize precision medicine research by linking these efforts and presenting the data of tissues and living cells in a graphical user interface (zBioLink). Linked biobank databases of this scale will facilitate the realization of systems medicine as a milestone on the way to an effective PM program that enables the identification of predictive biomarkers and potential drug targets across large cohorts of cancer patients. We anticipate that the project will be completed within two years. Alignment with national initiatives (Swiss Biobanking Platform, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics) is intended to allow for collaborations and harmonization of standards across Switzerland.

NASH is associated with obesity and intestinal dysbiosis, i.e., a change in the microbiota linked to disease, and translocation of bacterial products. Thus, the intestinal barrier has an important role in keeping bacteria at a distance to the host. Regenerating islet-derived protein (Reg) 3 lectins are antimicrobial molecules that are secreted by intestinal epithelial cells and Paneth cells as part of the innate immunity, and maintain sterility of the inner mucus layer. Reg3ß and Reg3? are almost exclusively expressed in the small intestine, but not in the liver or immune cells. Reg3 lectins are regulated by interleukin (IL)-22, which is mainly released by intestinal innate lymphoid cells (ILC3). The absence of Reg3 lectins promotes translocation of viable bacteria and alcoholic liver disease. In NASH, this interrelation has not yet been investigated. Hypotheses: Fast-food diet reduces expression of Reg3 lectins in the small intestine of mice by lower IL-22 expression. This promotes translocation of viable bacteria and hepatic features of NASH. Intestinal overexpression of Reg3? will prevent NASH. Humans with NASH are thought to have lower intestinal Reg3 expression than patients with NAFLD or normal weight controls. The proposed study will investigate the role of Reg3ß and ? on the pathogenesis of NASH. Molecular mechanisms were investigated in mouse models during an advanced postdoc mobility fellowship at the University of California San Diego. To test the relevance of Reg3 lectins in humans is part of a return phase fellowship in Switzerland. In patients with NASH and NAFLD the expression pattern of intestinal lectins along the small intestine will be investigated. Future directions/Outlook: Reg3 lectins can be regarded as endogenous antibiotics. If the project reveals that Reg3 expression is reduced in NASH, and this correlates to increased hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis, this would add significantly to the importance of the gut-liver axis. Moreover, strategies that aim at inducing IL-22/Reg3 lectins might become an integral part of precision medicine in liver disease.

However, many current approaches for prevention by screening and surveillance programs have achieved minimal success in reducing mortality at a high cost to healthcare services. Within the MRC priority area Precision Medicine and Diagnostics, my research project will develop and apply mechanistic mathematical models that describe how normal tissues develop into cancer to predict how surveillance (and thus early detection) may be optimised. Through simulation and mathematical analysis of the pattern and pace of cancer development, I will calculate the likely position of any individual on a developmental pathway towards cancer. By then creating a virtual population of patients, I will be able to judge the effectiveness of a screening/surveillance regime across a population. I will parameterise the biological details of these models with data spanning molecular to population scales from Health Data Research UK and a growing network of expert collaborators. I will then use this framework to predict the optimal times to screen at-risk individuals and to tailor a surveillance regime to individual patients, and validate these predictions with epidemiological data. The ultimate aims are to: 1) Rigorously assess and inform the best screening strategies to benefit public health recommendations 2) Translate this work into risk assessment, biomarker discovery, and patient stratification in the healthcare setting. My novel methodologies integrate bioinformatics using Big Data, survival analysis using public health record data, stochastic modelling, and classical biostatistics to address cancer prevention problems.

The framework will be refined using a number of case studies. To facilitate translation, guidance will be developed based on the case studies describing the use of the framework (objective 3). The statistical model is central to our approach. Our key proposal is not simply to apply shrinkage, but to explicitly incorporate a mixture component to differentiate reproducible subgroup effects from chance effects. This is similar to the use of slab and spike priors for variable selection. The hierarchical Bayesian framework allows direct inclusion of information elicited from experts. It also naturally extends to allow information on subgroup effects to be "shared" across studies and endpoints and can incorporate either individual patient data or reported summary statistics. To understand the performance of our models in real live settings, we will compare the (i) sensitivity and specificity of the identification of subgroup effects and (ii) bias and interval coverage for estimation of identified subgroup effects in a series of simulation studies. We will develop web based tools that will facilitate clearer, quantifiable and readily interpretable statements of the prior plausibility of subgroup effects. These tools, and methods of elicitation, will be tested during our case studies. In particular we will test various scales for elicitation to determine which are meaningful to experts. In order to support the practical use of the tools developed under objectives 1 and 2, we will develop guidance describing and critically examining the use of the statistical model and elicitation tools in three distinct stages of technology development: (i) clinical trial planning (ii) the consideration of further studies based on subgroup analysis	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	462106.0	GBP

PET can enable earlier and more accurate treatment monitoring than CT and MR with the potential for earlier modification of cancer treatment to minimise toxicity and optimise effectiveness, using a personalised approach.Escalation of treatment may involve more aggressive chemotherapy or boosting radiotherapy dose. New techniques using intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) permit dose-painting, to areas that PET suggests may be more resistant to treatment. My proposed research:Will use PET to optimize patients ongoing treatment based on individual response and risk to side-effects.Maximise the benefit of new radiotherapy treatments, using PET to target the right areas.Will develop quantitative techniques for PET reading to improve on the use of the naked eye.Research will focus on haematological and head and neck cancers but have wider application. Aim 1 We hypothesise that PET can guide treatment to reduce toxicity and/or increase cure in trials:a) in early stage Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL)Patients will receive 3 drugs - doxorubicin, vinblastine, darcarbazine and either bleomycin [standard] or brentuximab vedotin (BV) [experimental] as the 4th drug. BV may be more effective with less toxicity. Patients with early complete metabolic response (CMR) on PET which is the primary endpoint will not receive radiotherapy [1042 patients].b) in Follicular Lymphoma (FL)Patients with PET-CMR after induction will be randomised to receive rituximab for 2 years or no further treatment. Potential cost savings are ~50 million annually for the NHS if no further treatment is not inferior. Patients without CMR will receive treatment with rituximab and lenalidomide which may prolong progression free survival. [840 patients].c) in patients > 60 years with HL or co-morbidities that limit standard treatment. BV and Bendamustine will be compared with standard treatment with CMR as the primary endpoint [120 patients]. We will also explore whether pre-treatment PET predicts patient outcomes, to enable PET-guided treatment from the start. Baseline features including metabolic tumour volume will be tested in cohorts with HL, Diffuse large B cell lymphoma and FL. The combination of imaging and non-imaging biomarkers including gene expression profiling and circulating tumour markers will be evaluated in collaboration with the Precision Medicine for Aggressive Lymphoma Consortium. Aim 2 We hypothesise that PET can be used to response-adapt radiotherapyWe will use methodology established by our group using PET-CT and currently being evaluated in PET-MR in a planned multicentre trial. Patients with head and neck cancer will be randomised to receive standard or adaptive intensity-modulated radiotherapy, boosting radiotherapy dose to areas of poor response on PET. We will evaluate PET tracers that image hypoxia with nested studies to explore observer variability in target volume delineation to derive a standard approach for PET-guided radiotherapy. We will explore practicalities of using PET with targeted radiotherapy techniques in lymphoma patients to spare normal tissues, using radiobiological modelling to estimate risk reduction. Aim 3 To evaluate techniques to improve the interpretation of PET responseSemi-quantitative analysis will be tested in lymphoma datasets to determine if this reduces observer variation and provides a continuous scale with incremental value. PET has been reported to show false positive uptake with new immunomodulatory agents effective against solid tumours. We will assess PET as an exploratory endpoint in 2 UK trials of novel agents in lymphoma to develop criteria for future response-adapted trials.

127	Dr Marcus Rauch	Alpha Biomics Ltd	None	2019-02-15	2019-10-15	Harnessing the microbiome for precision medicine using advanced multi-omics analytics	Every day, millions of people in the UK and worldwide are taking medications that will not help them. This is bad for patients but also financially burdens healthcare systems like the NHS. Patients need &quot;precision medicine&quot; where individual patients are better matched with safe and effective therapies that work for them. The gut microbiome (the bacteria that live in our gut) has important influence over drug response. For some patients with serious disease, having the right microbiome when starting treatment can literally mean the difference between life and death. Yet, patients have no way to predict and/or change the way they respond to therapy. AlphaBiomics was founded in March 2018 by a team of experienced and dedicated scientific entrepreneurs to address inconsistent treatment response. The company's' focus is to develop microbiome-based precision medicine productsto improve treatment outcome with immunomodulatory drugs in serious autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and multiple sclerosis (MS). By uncovering which factors (biomarkers) such as individual bacteria or microbial functions within the gut microbiome communities influence drug efficacy and toxicity, AlphaBiomics can provide patients with two types of products: Predictive diagnostics: to predict whether or not a patient will respond to treatment based on the microbial signals measured just before treatment begins. Companion therapeutics: that improve the efficacy of the primary immunotherapy they are starting. Companion therapeutics accompany the primary drug and can take several forms including bacteria, bacterial genes and/or microbiome- or host- derived bioactive small molecules or proteins that restore appropriate functionality in non-responders While encouraging results have been obtained by academic laboratories, the methods used have not yet reached the rigour and sophistication needed to get actionable insights for patients. AlphaBiomics will use i4i Connect financial support to draw together expertise in artificial intelligence, statistics, and microbiome science to complete its analysis pipeline and achieve strong proof-of-concept for its operational pipeline. Moreover, it will enable AlphaBiomics to better understand patients' needs via focus groups and to conduct critical market research and basic health economic analyses important to strengthen AlphaBiomics business case for follow on investment. AlphaBiomics will disseminate its progress and research results by updating patient advocacy groups, and by publishing its results in peer-reviewed journals. i4i Connect funding will accelerate AlphaBiomics mission to deliver safe and, efficacious and cost-effective drug therapies to patients who need them.

MM is preceded by prevalent, asymptomatic stages that may evolve with variable frequency, not accurately captured by current clinical prognostic scores. Supported by preliminary data, my hypothesis is that the same heterogeneity is present early on the disease course, and identification of the biological determinants of evolution at this stage will allow better prediction of its evolutionary trajectory, if not its control. In this proposal I will therefore make a sharp change from conventional approaches and move to early stages of MM using unique retrospective sample cohorts and ambitious prospective sampling. To identify clonal MM cells in the elderly before a monoclonal gammopathy can be detected, I will collect bone marrow (BM) from hundreds of hip replacement specimens, and analyze archive peripheral blood samples of thousands of healthy individuals with years of annotated clinical follow-up. This will identify early genomic alterations that are permissive to disease initiation/evolution and may serve as biomarkers for clinical screening. Through innovative, integrated single-cell genotyping and phenotyping of hundreds of asymptomatic MMs, I will functionally dissect heterogeneity and characterize the BM microenvironment to look for determinants of disease progression. Correlation with clinical outcome and mini-invasive serial sampling of circulating cell-free DNA will identify candidate biological markers to better predict evolution. Last, aggressive modelling of candidate early lesions and modifier screens will offer a list of vulnerabilities that could be exploited for rationale therapies. These methodologies will deliver a paradigm for the use of molecularly-driven precision medicine in cancer.	European Research Council	Consolidator Grant	1998781.0	EUR

We will genotype 200 participants from a memory-clinic based cohort of individuals with biomarker-proven AD at different clinical stages (prodromal, early, mid and late dementia stage). We will also include 180 participants from a longitudinal observation cohort of older adults at high genetic risk of developing AD. We will calculate Polygenic Risk Scores and profile the immune system of all individuals, and integrate those data with clinical data to obtain a complete map linking genetic profiles and disease manifestations across the entire spectrum of AD. From a selected subset of individuals across this map, we will generate induced pluripotent stem cells and differentiate them into microglia. We will then investigate microglia responses unbiasedly by single-cell RNA sequencing and functionally on synapse, amyloid and Tau effects, both in vivo in the context of a mature brain, after transplantation into mouse models for Abeta and/or Tau pathology, and in vitro in brain organoids. Both datasets will be benchmarked against ex-vivo human brain tissue. We will investigate how different PRS affect the response of microglia to amyloid plaques, neuronal tangles and their interaction with synapses. This work will establish how AD genetic risk translates into microglia behavior, and point to molecular and cellular pathways contributing to pathogenesis. By maximally exploiting clinical and research data and linking them to an individual risk score, this project will establish a roadmap towards precision medicine for AD. Our results will reveal novel therapeutic targets in AD and lay the foundations of a pre-clinical drug testing platform for AD.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	371564.0	GBP

SKOU	SYDDANSK UNIVERSITET	None	2019-08-01	2024-07-31	Improving health in people with multimorbidity: a paradigm shift in health care from disease-based curative models to personalized exercise therapy and self-management	The goal of this proposal is to support the paradigm shift in the health care of people with multiple chronic conditions in Europe from a focus on disease-based curative models to holistic person-centered self-care through personalized,supervised exercise therapy and education. The problem:The impact of multimorbidity on the individual and society is massive and much greater than the impact of single chronic conditions alone. However, effective treatments are missing and research and health care reinforce an inefficient and burdensome single-disease framework. The solution:Exercise has the potential to disrupt the ‘vicious cycle’ of systemic inflammation associated with chronic conditions and improve health in multimorbidity. A personalized exercise and education program aimed at supporting subsequent self-management by the individual will be developed in an interdisciplinary collaboration, building on evidence from biomarkers, patient involvement and methodological expertise. Self-reported,physiological and societal effects will be investigated in a randomized controlled trial comparing the personalized program with standard single-disease models of care. Scientific and public dissemination and implementation ensuring significant personal and societal benefit is fundamental to the proposal. The proposal is associated with high risk, as the current disease-based curative models involve treatment by several highly specialized health care providers, while the new person-centered self-management model is centered on a personalized program delivered by one health care provider. The ground-breaking nature of this proposal lies in its potential to revolutionize how health care is organized for people with multimorbidity, by giving them one primary care provider, and how we use non-surgical treatment in health care and science by bringing the concept of precision medicine into multimorbidity and utilizing it to improve treatment outcome with exercise therapy as the model.

131	Dr Paul Kirk	University of Cambridge	None	2019-07-10	2023-03-31	Statistical and Machine learning approaches for molecular precision medicine and beyond	A well-established goal of precision medicine is to identify and characterise disease subtypes, since these may be associated with differential prognoses and/or treatment responses. The existence of subtypes may be suggestive of the existence of multiple aetiologies or pathobiological mechanisms, with each subtype corresponding to a distinct disease-causing process or combination of processes. For diseases in which multiple disease-causing processes are operative within or upon each patient, recent research has highlighted how the identification of signatures associated with each process can also benefit precision medicine. In this context, signatures are detectable patterns that are the imprint of each causal process; e.g. characteristic genomic changes in cancer associated with distinct mutational processes, accumulated over time. Both subtype discovery and signature identification require the deconvolution of mixed signals, whether at the patient cohort level (subtype discovery) or within each patient (signature identification). We will undertake to develop a comprehensive suite of widely applicable analysis methods, implemented in open-source software, for the deconvolution of heterogeneity, and – working with clinical and wet-lab collaborators – demonstrate their utility in application areas where they will add value, and have the greatest impact. A particular methodological challenge that will be addressed within our research programme will be how best to integrate diverse sources of molecular and other information, using both novel statistical models and probabilistic machine learning approaches. Our work may be divided into 3 subthemes: (i) probabilistic discovery of disease subtypes and signatures; (ii) the analysis of electronic health records (EHRs) to define multimorbidity clusters; and (iii) modelling heterogeneity in the analysis of ’omics datasets. We have strong collaborations with teams across the Cambridge Biomedical Campus, particularly within the Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute (CRUK-CI), and the Cambridge Centre for Proteomics (CCP), as well as within the MRC Biostatistics Unit (BSU). Particular applications of our work include molecular characterisation of high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC); pan-cancer proteomic characterisation; understanding sub-cellular protein localisation; and the development of clustering methods for genetic summary data.

132	Dr Rebecca Bendayan	King´s College London	None	2019-09-12	2019-10-12	Longitudinal Profiling Techniques: Applications to immune and cognitive ageing	Our aim is to set up and develop a new collaboration to investigate the association between immune ageing with cognitive ageing in longitudinal settings applying novel analytical and computational strategies. Dr. Shen-Orr is a leading expert in high resolution longitudinal profiling with applications in immune ageing. Dr. Bendayan is an expert in longitudinal data analysis techniques with applications in cognitive ageing. The combinations of their areas of expertise and research interests could provide new ways of understanding changes in these areas in ageing population. In this visit, we aim to identify opportunities of translation of the combination of both approaches to precision medicine and design a roadmap for potential collaborative projects. On one side, Shen-Orr & Furman (2013) highlighted that variability in immune phenotypes increases with age which is likely to be associated to an individual's life course health trajectories; and they proposed to consider the changes in the variance of immunological parameters as different immune trajectories of ageing. On the other side, Bendayan has also found that there is an increase in variability in cognitive phenotypes with age (e.g., Bendayan et al., 2018; Davis, Bendayan et al, 2017) which might be associated to other health conditions which in turn are known to be linked to the immunological markers (e.g., Miller & Raison, 2016). Given this context, we propose to explore the association between immune and cognitive markers in older populations, first in data collected for research purposes to which we have already access and then tailor this approach to its potential application to electronic health records. Following, Shen-Orr & Furman (2013) we hypothesize that older individuals with lower variance in immunological parameters will show a cognitive performance above average for their age and in this groups of individuals we will find common protective factors in their life course associated. In addition, both researchers are interested in improving techniques for longitudinal analysis and while they share applications there is a great opportunity to share expertise from statistical and highly computational backgrounds.

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin and coronary heart disease	Current strategies for the assessment for coronary heart disease are imprecise with unacceptable consequences for many patients including prescription of unnecessary life-long therapies or failure to identify and treat those at greatest risk of myocardial infarction and death. Using complementary clinical and epidemiological approaches, I propose to evaluate high-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing as a tool for precision medicine to improve the diagnosis, risk stratification, investigation, and treatment of patients with coronary heart disease. I will evaluate whether cardiac troponin concentrations can be used as a barometer of cardiac health and whether its modulation tracks with cardiac outcomes. I anticipate that high-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing will become as essential in the diagnosis, risk stratification, and management of patients with stable coronary heart disease as it is currently in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction.
