20	Professor Marais Richard	University of Manchester	2016-07-01	2021-06-30	Molecular Oncology Group	Background: Over the last 10 years, our Group has made important contributions to our understanding of the fundamental processes underlying melanoma development and progression. Our studies have had significant impact on melanoma patient care. We have developed tractable models of melanoma that have allowed us to study gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. With our move to Manchester, we have established excellent connections to clinical colleagues at the Christie NHS Foundation Trust, and developed a translational programme that aims to inform patient stratification and the clinical management of melanoma and other cancers. Aims: Our aims are: • To investigate how ultraviolet light drives melanoma development. • To develop new treatments for uveal melanoma. • To develop new drugs for melanoma and other cancers. • To develop new treatments for prostate cancer. • To develop a precision medicine platform for melanoma and other cancers. Methods: Underpinning all of our studies are the models of disease we have developed and refined over the past ten years, including genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) and patient-derived models (cell lines, PDX, CDX) models. We have extensive expertise in next generation sequencing (NGS) approaches and functional analysis of cancer biology. We will use our GEMMs to dissect the gene-gene and gene-environment interactions on melanoma development and progression, and to study responses to immunotherapies to guide optimisation of these drugs in the clinic. We will develop and study GEMMs of uveal melanoma and prostate cancer, which, coupled with analysis of patient samples, will allow us to identify novel targets and develop or optimise much-needed new therapeutic approaches for these cancers. Using patient-derived models, we will identify new therapeutic targets for melanoma and other cancers, and investigate mechanisms of resistance, allowing us to develop precision medicine approaches for melanoma and other cancers, and to develop new anti-cancer drugs. Impact: Our philosophy is that patient care should be based on improved knowledge of cancer biology. Our overarching aim is to understand the processes of cancer to develop better approaches to prevention, to develop new drugs, and to improve the clinical management of cancer patients.

21	Professor Hochhauser Daniel	University College London	2016-11-01	2021-10-31	A national post-mortem tissue collection protocol - the PEACE (Posthumous tissuE donAtion in CancEr) study	Background: The study of tumour evolution, immune-surveillance, metastatic disease and therapeutic resistance is essential for the development of precision medicine. Thus far this has generally been supported by access to tissue and blood samples, surplus to diagnostics requirements, which have been donated by living patients. However, the general lack of sufficient primary and metastatic tumour samples has often restricted cancer research to either established tumour cell lines or archival material. Aims: The aim of the centre accelerator award is to fund the infrastructure required to facilitate the collection of post-mortem tissue in patients with known metastatic cancer or primary brain tumours across several UK sites, establishing a national post-mortem tissue collection protocol. This will be based on the PEACE (Posthumous tissuE donAtion in CancEr) (REC 13/L0/0972, UCLH R&D 13/0165, UKCRN 18422) study, which is a multi-centre prospective observational study involving the collection of both tumour and normal tissue at post-mortem, blood samples for germ line DNA, circulating free DNA (cfDNA) and circulating tumour cells (CTCs). Methods: Patients with solid tumour types eligible for the study will be consented when alive, at which point blood samples will be collected. A post-mortem will be performed within 48hrs after death guided by prior imaging and post-mortem findings. Sampling will entail the excision of small amounts of tumour and normal tissue from each site of disease for snap freezing as fresh tissue as well as histopathological assessment. Where possible, multiple tumour regions will be collected. Clinical data will be collected and samples tracked using databases created by the CRUK and UCL Cancer Trials Centre. How the results of this research will be used: A study governance board will review both internal and external applications for the use of collected tissue and blood supported by independant funding. The aim is to link in with existing CRUK and non-CRUK funded studies, as well as national sequencing initiatives. Having created an unprecendented resource of tissue from highly annotated patient cohorts, this award will enable future research investigating various projects such as those investigating intratumour heterogeneity, polygenic and convergent mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies, tumour immunological landscape and neo-antigenic repertoire, the origins and evolution of metastatic subclones, tumour organoid models that efficiently represent the genetic diversity of late stage disease, and the use of cfDNA and CTCs in the context of metastatic cancer and primary brain tumours.

Having created an unprecendented resource of tissue from highly annotated patient cohorts, this award will enable future research investigating various projects such as those investigating intratumour heterogeneity, polygenic and convergent mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies, tumour immunological landscape and neo-antigenic repertoire, the origins and evolution of metastatic subclones, tumour organoid models that efficiently represent the genetic diversity of late stage disease, and the use of cfDNA and CTCs in the context of metastatic cancer and primary brain tumours.

This intra-tumour heterogeneity (ITH) can foster adaptation to changing environments through Darwinian evolution and is likely to play an important role in the development of drug resistance. ITH is also a major hurdle for treatment personalisation as current molecular profiling methods are poorly suited for the assessment of heterogeneous tumours. Aims Anti-angiogenic therapy and combination chemotherapy are the most effective treatments for patients with metastatic clear cell renal cancers (ccRCC) and colorectal cancers (CRC), respectively. Resistance to these agents invariably occurs but the mechanisms of resistance remain poorly understood, precluding the development of more effective therapies. ITH and the evolution of subclones which are undetectable before treatment may have hampered the comprehensive identification of drug resistance drivers to date. Our aim is to characterize clonal evolution processes during therapy in ccRCC and CRC in order to identify: • recurrently selected drivers and mechanisms of drug resistance. • blood based biomarkers which can predict treatment outcomes in heterogeneous cancers. • new therapeutic approaches to prevent the evolution of drug resistance. Methods We will develop novel sequencing technologies which can reveal the subclonal composition of heterogeneous tumours in the cell-free DNA (cfDNA) extracted from blood samples. Analysis of longitudinally collected samples from patients with metastatic ccRCC during first-line anti-angiogenic therapy will reveal clonal dynamics and recurrent evolutionary trajectories. Modelling approaches will be applied to scrutinize whether drug resistance evolution can be predicted based on cfDNA profiles. The evolution of drug resistance in metastatic CRC during first-line combination chemotherapy will be studied through paired biopsies taken at diagnosis and at radiological progression. Whole-genome sequencing of these biopsies will be used to reconstruct the evolutionary histories of resistant clones and to identify drivers of resistance. Biopsy-derived primary cell cultures will be used to identify new therapeutic targets which can reverse or delay the evolution of chemotherapy resistance. How the results will be used: This project addresses a major need in translational oncology by delivering precision medicine technologies to comprehensively profile the genetics of heterogeneous cancers through minimally invasive blood tests. This should foster the development of novel treatment personalisation approaches. The identification of chemotherapy resistance mechanism and of therapeutic vulnerabilities of drug resistant CRC cells should lead to improved therapeutic strategies which will ultimately increase patient survival.

The National Lung Matrix Trial (NLMT) is a large national study investigating genetic biomarker/targeted therapy combinations through partnership between Cancer Research UK (CRUK), AstraZeneca/MedImmune and Pfizer. Patients will be selected for the NLMT based on CRUK’s Stratified Medicine Programme 2, which is performing large volume molecular pre-screening. Aims: There are currently 8 targeted drugs and 21 different drug-biomarker combinations. The aim is to determine whether there is sufficient signal of activity in any drug-biomarker combination to warrant further investigation. We chose a Bayesian adaptive design that gives a more realistic approach to decision-making and flexibility to make conclusions without fixing the sample size. The screening platform is an adaptable 28-gene Nextera Next Generation Sequencing platform designed by Illumina. This covers the range of molecular abnormalities being targeted. The design allows new biomarker-drug combinations to be incorporated by substantial amendment. The pre-clinical data has been rigorously assessed and the implications incorporated into selection of biomarkers for each drug. Examples of this process include; only treating FGFR mutations which have been specifically demonstrated to be transforming and tumourigenic; excluding patients with concomitant KRAS mutations being treated with the AKT inhibitor; excluding patients with concomitant abnormalities which activate AKT/mTOR signalling in patients with KRAS mutations being treated with palbociclib where synthetic lethality is dependent upon senescence induction. Methods: Current Arms: AZD4547: FGFR2/3 mutation AZD2014: LKB1 mutation, TSC1/2 mutation Palbociclib: p16 loss, CDK4 amplification, CCND1 amplification, KRAS mutation (all cohorts - proficient Rb) Crizotinib: Met amplification and exon 14 splice muations, ROS gene fusions Selumetinib/Docetaxel: NRAS mutation, NF1 mutation AZD5363: PIK3CA mutation & amplification, PTEN mutation and loss, AKT mutation (all cohorts are KRAS wildtype) AZD9291: EGFR T790M mutation Proposed arms: PLX7486: BRAF mutation PLX8394: NTRK mutation How will the results be used: The entire premise of the NLMT is to discover novel highly active drugs in well-defined molecular subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer. The aim is to identify agents in previously untested molecular cohorts which will transform patient care in the same way as the EGFR TKIs in EGFR mutant disease and crizotinib in ALK-rearranged and ROS-fusion disease. We are aiming to increase the number of effective biomarker drug combinations to widen access of lung cancer patients to active personalised medicines.

36	Dr Waugh David	Queen's University Belfast	2015-07-01	2020-06-30	Research Resource – A national digital pathology and image analysis platform for solid tumours, complemented by a comprehensive Clinical Fellowship programme in Molecular Pathology.	Background: Molecular digital pathology (MDP) and quantitative tissue imaging are central to modern molecular pathology, biomarker discovery, clinical trials and precision medicine. Aims: This CRUK Accelerator award is aimed at establishing a MDP network of CRUK Centres, led by Belfast, to build resource and manpower, drive adoption of the technology in cancer research, integrate systems, establish technology standards and grow our reputation and leadership in this field. In tandem, this proposal aims to significantly improve UK training/education in molecular pathology, recognised as a major gap, through the establishment of an MSc-driven Fellowship Training Programme in molecular pathology. Methods: Belfast CRUK Centre will act as the lead, given its strong track record in digital pathology, molecular pathology and developing an integrated pipeline for discovery and diagnostics in cancer. The other CRUK Centres within the network have been selected where strong research programmes and collaborative opportunities will benefit from the accelerated development of DMP capacity. A number of key scientific themes will be pursued across Centres, focused on the genotyping of epithelia and immune cancer compartments in breast, lung, colorectal, prostate and CNS cancers, as well as automated tumour analysis for next generation sequencing. The over-arching goals are to provide a UK-digital hub for remote storage/sharing of tissue images, to standardise imaging methodologies, to integrate technologies and support data-exchange between Centres. Each centre is also committed to improving training and education in molecular and digital pathology training across the UK. By establishing 16 Clinical Fellowships through an MSc degree per year, over a 4 year period, delivered in Belfast with cross-centre projects, we will provide candidates with in depth experience in molecular pathology – further strengthening growth and leadership in these areas. This will establish a model for modern pathology training nationally in translational research. How results of this research will be used: The proposal will create a platform that will allow the systematic characterization of the epithelial and immune components of cancer. Initially, it will be applied to specific subgroups of breast and prostate cancers, to inform future immune therapy strategies. Furthermore, the share of technology and software licenses available to all Centres in the application will create a UK-MDP Hub, making MDP available to virtually all CR-UK driven projects. In addition, this proposal sets the basis for the systematic training of UK pathologists and scientists in molecular pathology to create a sustainable, national resource of talent.

Despite clear clinical and biological differences between individual patients with PAH the treatment is uniform, based on an algorithm that matches the number of vasodilator drugs to functional class. I aim to establish SMURF1 inhibition as a novel anti-proliferative therapy and pathway for precision medicine for patients with PAH. I have demonstrated that SMAD-specific ubiquitin ligase regulatory factor-1 (SMURF1) is critical to pulmonary vascular remodelling and experimental PAH, and that SMURF1 mRNA expression is detectable and increased in peripheral blood from patients with PAH. In November 2015 my collaborators (Novartis) patented a series of SMURF1 inhibitors. Through this Fellowship I will use cutting edge RNA and protein profling techniques to determine mechanism though which SMURF1 mediates disease pathology and, using samples and clinical data from the worlds largest and best genotyped-phenotyped cohort of patients with PAH (the UK National Cohort), investigate means of identifying patients with cellular abnormalities related to SMURF1 who may benefit from a SMURF1 targeted therapy.

40	Professor Powles Thomas	University of Glasgow	2015-02-01	2019-03-31	CRUK/14/042 ATLANTIS - Maintaining response in urothelial cancer: A personalised precision medicine trial	Background Metastatic urothelial cancer (MUC) is the eighth most common cause of cancer death in the UK. Chemotherapy is standard treatment for MUC. Although MUC is initially sensitive to chemotherapy, patients usually relapse within 6 months of completion of therapy. The outcome once relapse has occurred is very poor (median overall survival 8 months). Therefore, maintaining response to chemotherapy is an attractive goal, and a good environment for testing active single agents in MUC. ATLANTIS is a multi-arm multi-stage signal searching study. Patients will be allocated to treatment (v.s. placebo) based on biomarker expression. Aims: The study will investigate whether maintenance targeted therapy after chemotherapy, based on biomarker expression, delays time to progression and overall survival for patients with MUC. Methods: This will be a double blind randomised multi-arm randomised control, multi-centre study with the potential for the addition of new arms. The intention is that positive arms will graduate from phase II to phase III testing; the phase II outcome data may be incorporated in the phase III study. Consent for biomarker testing will take place while patients are receiving first line chemotherapy for UC. Archival tumour tissue will be collected and analysed for biomarker expression. Biomarker expression will determine which sub-study the patient will enter if they are subsequently eligible for and consent to the main study. Patients who have clinical benefit after completing at least 4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy for MUC, will be assigned to cohort 1 or cohort 2 based upon the results of their biomarker analyses (AR +ve/AR –ve). Cohort 1 (Androgen Receptor (AR) +ve Patients will be randomised to receive either: Enzalutamide 160mg daily until progression or placebo daily until progression. Cohort 2 (Androgen Receptor (AR) -ve Patients will be randomised to receive either: Cabozantinib 40mg daily until progression or placebo daily until progression. Results/Analysis: All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Progression-free survival and overall survival will be compared between the study arms in the context of a Cox model incorporating the baseline minimisation factors. At the end of the study if the observed PFS difference in favour of the experimental arm is statistically significant at 10% this will be a clear signal that a subsequent phase III study is warranted.

The list of potential actionable genetic changes continues to grow. Crucial to the efficient testing of multiple biomarker/drug combinations is a screening platform designed to detect the genetic changes in samples typically obtained from patients with advanced NSCLC.

The National Lung Matrix Trial consists of a series of parallel, multi-centre, single-arm phase II trials, each arm testing an experimental targeted drug in a population stratified by multiple pre-specified target biomarkers. There are currently 8 targeted drugs and 21 different drug-biomarker combinations. The aim is to determine whether there is sufficient signal of activity in any drug-biomarker combination to warrant further investigation. The study will be open at all ECMCs and will be carried out under a single clinical trial protocol and regulatory submission. The study is adaptive allowing rapid incorporation of new biomarker/drug combinations via substantial amendment. All arms incorporate comprehensive ctDNA analysis, supplemented with pre-and post-therapy tissue biopsy, for detection of predictive biomarkers, early detection of resistance and determination of mechanisms of resistance. The National Lung Matrix Trial is the largest precision trial in NSCLC. Sustainability will be ensured by inclusion of formal phase Ib testing of novel combinations, the potential to assess biomarker specificity in biomarker negative patients and the introduction of new pharma partners to the SMP-2/National Lung Matrix Trial consortium.

Cancer is a genetic disease and each patient's tumour contains several genetic lesions which are identified by next generation sequencing (NGS) and influence patient's outcome. A global current challenge lies in translating NGS data into benefit of cancer patients. As attractive novel therapeutic concept, precision medicine addresses genetic lesions using targeted therapies. A large number of targeted drugs and compounds exist and are currently developed such as kinase inhibitors; unfortunately, numerous clinical trials on targeted therapies failed.

47	Professor Mills Nicholas	University of Lausanne	2017-09-01	2020-08-31	Translational hyperpolarized metabolic imaging of the heart for the quantification of metabolic changes in chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity	Cancer treatment containing doxorubicin can have irreversible side effects that lead to heart failure. Substantial evidence suggests that early-onset metabolic changes precede cardiac dysfunction, and that improving mitochondrial activity may better protect the heart against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (DC). Several food supplements are suspected to boost mitochondrial metabolic activity, but it is unknown whether they avert the chemotherapy-induced metabolic changes. Knowledge of such changes could lead to a better understanding of DC that might improve cancer treatment and outcome. However, no means have been available to detect such metabolic changes in vivo.Recently, hyperpolarized (HP) magnetic resonance (MR) technology demonstrated the measurement of real-time metabolic activity in vivo after the injection of HP 13C labeled metabolites. Using HP metabolic imaging, early onset metabolic changes were visualized in a diseased large animal model, and the technology was translated to image prostate cancer in patients in 2013. A significant hurdle in the clinical translation of HP MR is the presence of toxic free radicals that necessitates a time-consuming filtration process. However, exciting recent findings showed that HP metabolic imaging of pure, radical-free metabolite solutions is possible.In this proposal, the researcher will develop novel “radical-free” HP MR technology for metabolic imaging in vivo using advanced image reconstruction methods. She will establish a link between in vivo metabolic changes and the level of DC, and investigate whether this damage can be prevented with novel food supplements. HP MR enables the real-time measurement of biochemical processes, which has never been possible before. If heart failure progression in DC can be monitored with HP MR, and averted, this would improve the understanding of cardiotoxic mechanisms and support the design of precision medicine through strategies aimed at minimizing cardiotoxicity, knowledge that can be translated to patients or even allow for individualized therapy. The proposed study is novel because the hyperpolarization of metabolites without adding radicals is revolutionary, and the application of CS to metabolic imaging of the heart is innovative. This will be the first study to develop radical-free HP metabolic imaging for the heart, and the first to identify and quantify the in vivo metabolic biomarkers associated with DC. Furthermore we will establish the cardioprotective effect of NR.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Ambizione	597056.0CHF
48	Professor Mills Nicholas	University of Zurich	2017-02-01	2019-01-31	Digital Cancer Biobank - zBioLink	The recent dramatic success of immune checkpoint inhibitors has been a long awaited revolution in cancer treatment. Combined with the broad adoption of next-generation-sequencing (NGS) and functional drug screening techniques, the face of biomedical research is changing rapidly. In the future, routine molecular analysis and in vitro pharmacological testing will support patient-tailored therapies. But our understanding of how particular features in high-dimensional datasets contribute to or predict therapeutic response is still in its infancy. Thus, the current proposal is intended to link various biobanks at the University Hospital Zürich (USZ) to follow-up on an initial study by the group of Prof. Mitch Levesque (co-leader of this proposal) that identified a significant predictive biomarker of response to both currently available immune checkpoint inhibitors in melanoma (anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1).Clinical cancer specimens are unique and finite. They are also a critical foundation for precision medicine (PM). In general, clinical specimens such as blood, tissue or cell samples are annotated and stored in biospecimen banks (biobanks) that are typically associated with and maintained by a specific clinical center. In this interdisciplinary BioLink project, we propose to generate a digital biobank of melanoma specimens and living cells by linking the resources of at least two departments (Dept. of Dermatology & Pathology, and potentially Oncology and Hematology), where the genomic and pharmacological information is recorded and presented in searchable, digital files that are stored with the clinical metadata in a database. This pioneering project builds on a worldwide unique collection of tissue specimens and data acquisition techniques present in Zürich. It has the potential to transform PM by making data that represents the quantitative molecular and functional makeup of clinical samples accessible for research. This project will address the urgent clinical need of establishing a better stratification of metastatic melanoma patients for the most efficacious therapy. This will be based on the methods developed by the group of Prof. Levesque and recently presented at ASCO 2016. But in order to validate and expand their findings, it is necessary to gather the relevant data and samples from the USZ in three well-defined steps. The first is to establish the laboratory information system SLims (Genohm SA, Lausanne) by linking two established physical tissue and cell biobanks at the University Hospital Zürich (Dept. of Pathology and Dermatology), the second is to establish database capabilities, data analytics, and visualization tools (cBioPortal, The Hyve, Cambridge, USA) to support in silico research with the available genomic and clinical/phenotypic metadata, and the third is to define personalized, rationally chosen treatment regimens for each individual melanoma patient to prolong life after ex vivo pharmacologic testing of melanoma cells (precision medicine).We will meet these important challenges through the development and the implementation of a new, integrated strategy that is focused on the combined analysis of immune signatures and genetics as well as all available clinical parameters. Our two-year project will be initiated and made feasible by focusing on malignant melanoma and builds on the results and advances achieved by the project team. In the past, the applicants have successfully established facilities to convert physical specimens into digital files representing their genomic states. A pilot program of a carefully selected set of 150 specimens will be carried out, comparing features of tumors and matching living cells. Specifically, the unique technical capabilities and resources the project team will bring to bear on melanoma include 1) unique, annotated clinical tissue and cell resources including the two largest cancer tissue and cell biobanks in Switzerland, 2) technologies to generate genetic barcodes and drug response data of melanoma samples in a high-throughput manner, 3) a novel framework (Oracle Translational Research Center Platform) for linking metadata in the clinic, and 4) (bio-) informatics tools to define and visualize the networks perturbed in melanoma. Associated challenges will be solved by the development of a digital biobank application, using the cBioPortal software (The Hyve, Cambridge) that visualizes different biobanking initiatives. Another result and unique feature of the project will be the prospective generation of a digital biobank sui generis for all types of disease, called zBioLink. Besides conventional tissue and cell samples, sequencing results will be systematically collected and integrated with clinical outcome information and pharmacological in vitro data. The project will extend the current histopathological and genetic characterization of cancer tissue to the level of functional drug response data. In addition, the zBioLink project will establish a general framework for bringing basic research discoveries to the clinics for patients’ benefit and provide an environment for clinical and basic scientists to collaborate efficiently. The project team has already implemented a tumor-board in molecular-oncology and immuno-oncology at the University Hospital Zürich, where selected patients from the pilot study with metastatic disease can be discussed. Access to data will be provided by the Research Data Service Center, USZ. The project will democratize precision medicine research by linking these efforts and presenting the data of tissues and living cells in a graphical user interface (zBioLink). Linked biobank databases of this scale will facilitate the realization of systems medicine as a milestone on the way to an effective PM program that enables the identification of predictive biomarkers and potential drug targets across large cohorts of cancer patients. We anticipate that the project will be completed within two years. Alignment with national initiatives (Swiss Biobanking Platform, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics) is intended to allow for collaborations and harmonization of standards across Switzerland.

By embedding ratiometric fluorescent particle-based sensors within 3D scaffolds, the changes in target analyte concentrations can be monitored and used to study the interactions between tumour cells and stromal cells in 3D tumoroids/scaffolds and to monitor response of the cells to drug treatments. I first demonstrated successful fabrication of barcoded capsules for multiplex sensing of H+, K+, and Na+ ions. Next, I demonstrated the use of pH-sensing capsules as valid real time optical reporter tools to sense and monitor intracellular acidification in living cells. Thus, I can fabricate capsule sensors for investigating the role of key analytes that are involved in regulation of crucial physiological mechanisms. In addition, I successfully integrated pH-sensing capsules within 3D nanofibrous matrices and demonstrated their operation under pH switches. INTERCELLMED will engineer 3D scaffolds that do not only sense extracellular pH but are also able to sense K+ and O2 changes. To this aim, a novel set of anisotropic analyte-sensitive ratiometric capsules will be developed and applied for generating robust and flexible capsules-embedded sensing scaffolds. To validate the functions of the 3D sensing platform, cocoltures of tumour cells and stromal cells will be grown and their interaction and response to drug treatments will be studied by mapping the K+/H+/O2 gradients in and around the cell aggregates. Finally, the 3D sensing platform will be adapted for growing tumour tissue-derived cells that will be tested ex-vivo with anticancer dugs. Specific mathematical models of cellular interactions will be developed to represent the biological processes occurring within the 3D sensing platform.

The list of potential actionable genetic changes continues to grow. Crucial to the efficient testing of multiple biomarker/drug combinations is a screening platform designed to detect the genetic changes in samples typically obtained from patients with advanced NSCLC. CR-UK’s Stratified Medicine Programme 2 (SMP2) will undertake large volume national molecular pre-screening using an Illumina NGS platform, which will integrate with a national clinical trial to further test the principle of precision medicine in NSCLC and identify new bona fide targeted treatments. The National Lung Matrix Trial consists of a series of parallel, multi-centre, single-arm phase II trials, each arm testing an experimental targeted drug in a population stratified by multiple pre-specified target biomarkers. There are currently 8 targeted drugs and 21 different drug-biomarker combinations. The aim is to determine whether there is sufficient signal of activity in any drug-biomarker combination to warrant further investigation. The study will be open at all ECMCs and will be carried out under a single clinical trial protocol and regulatory submission. The study is adaptive allowing rapid incorporation of new biomarker/drug combinations via substantial amendment. All arms incorporate comprehensive ctDNA analysis, supplemented with pre-and post-therapy tissue biopsy, for detection of predictive biomarkers, early detection of resistance and determination of mechanisms of resistance. The National Lung Matrix Trial is the largest precision trial in NSCLC. Sustainability will be ensured by inclusion of formal phase Ib testing of novel combinations, the potential to assess biomarker specificity in biomarker negative patients and the introduction of new pharma partners to the SMP-2/National Lung Matrix Trial consortium.

However as we enter the era of precision medicine, poor representation of some cancer types, insufficient numbers to capture the genetic diversity of cancer, lack of clinical outcome data and lack of comparison to normal reference sample limit their use. Novel cell culturing methods such as organoid derivation have revolutionised our ability to derive cell line models from both healthy and diseased tissue, and have the potential to overcome these limitations. We intend to create new cancer organoid cell line models from multiple tumour types as an experimental tool. These cell lines will be characterised at the level of the genome and transcriptome, profiled for differential response to anti-cancer therapies, and made available to the research community. We anticipate that this highly annotated resource will have broad applications and serve to catalyse a new wave of discovery in fundamental cancer biology and therapeutics.

Cancer therapy is experiencing a switch from non-specific, cytotoxic agents towards molecularly targeted and rationally designed compounds with the promise of greater efficacy and fewer side effects. The two cell-cycle kinases CDK4 and CDK6 normally facilitate cell-cycle progression but are abnormally activated in certain cancers. CDK6 is up-regulated in hematopoietic malignancies, where it is the predominant cell-cycle kinase. The importance of CDK4/6 for tumor development is underscored by the fact that the US FDA selected inhibitors of the kinase activity of CDK4/6 as 'breakthrough of the year 2013'. Our recent findings suggest that the effects of the inhibitors may be limited as CDK6 is not only involved in cell-cycle progression: ground-breaking research in my group and others has shown that CDK6 is involved in regulation of transcription in a kinase-independent manner thereby driving the proliferation of leukemic stem cells and tumor formation. We have now identified mutations in CDK6 that convert it from a tumor promoter into a tumor suppressor. This unexpected outcome is accompanied by a distinct transcriptional profile. Separating the tumor-promoting from the tumor suppressive functions may open a novel therapeutic avenue for drug development. We aim at understanding which domains and residues of CDK6 are involved in rewiring the transcriptional landscape to pave the way for sophisticated inhibitors. The idea of turning a cancer cell's own most potent weapon against itself is novel and would represent a new paradigm for drug design. Finally, the understanding of CDK6 functions in tumor promotion and maintenance will also result in better patient stratification and improved treatment decisions for a broad spectrum of cancer types.'

62	Dr Rauch Marcus	Alpha Biomics Ltd	2019-02-15	2019-10-15	Harnessing the microbiome for precision medicine using advanced multi-omics analytics	Every day, millions of people in the UK and worldwide are taking medications that will not help them. This is bad for patients but also financially burdens healthcare systems like the NHS. Patients need &quot;precision medicine&quot; where individual patients are better matched with safe and effective therapies that work for them. The gut microbiome (the bacteria that live in our gut) has important influence over drug response. For some patients with serious disease, having the right microbiome when starting treatment can literally mean the difference between life and death. Yet, patients have no way to predict and/or change the way they respond to therapy. AlphaBiomics was founded in March 2018 by a team of experienced and dedicated scientific entrepreneurs to address inconsistent treatment response. The company's' focus is to develop microbiome-based precision medicine productsto improve treatment outcome with immunomodulatory drugs in serious autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and multiple sclerosis (MS). By uncovering which factors (biomarkers) such as individual bacteria or microbial functions within the gut microbiome communities influence drug efficacy and toxicity, AlphaBiomics can provide patients with two types of products: Predictive diagnostics: to predict whether or not a patient will respond to treatment based on the microbial signals measured just before treatment begins. Companion therapeutics: that improve the efficacy of the primary immunotherapy they are starting. Companion therapeutics accompany the primary drug and can take several forms including bacteria, bacterial genes and/or microbiome- or host- derived bioactive small molecules or proteins that restore appropriate functionality in non-responders While encouraging results have been obtained by academic laboratories, the methods used have not yet reached the rigour and sophistication needed to get actionable insights for patients. AlphaBiomics will use i4i Connect financial support to draw together expertise in artificial intelligence, statistics, and microbiome science to complete its analysis pipeline and achieve strong proof-of-concept for its operational pipeline. Moreover, it will enable AlphaBiomics to better understand patients' needs via focus groups and to conduct critical market research and basic health economic analyses important to strengthen AlphaBiomics business case for follow on investment. AlphaBiomics will disseminate its progress and research results by updating patient advocacy groups, and by publishing its results in peer-reviewed journals. i4i Connect funding will accelerate AlphaBiomics mission to deliver safe and, efficacious and cost-effective drug therapies to patients who need them.

MM is preceded by prevalent, asymptomatic stages that may evolve with variable frequency, not accurately captured by current clinical prognostic scores. Supported by preliminary data, my hypothesis is that the same heterogeneity is present early on the disease course, and identification of the biological determinants of evolution at this stage will allow better prediction of its evolutionary trajectory, if not its control. In this proposal I will therefore make a sharp change from conventional approaches and move to early stages of MM using unique retrospective sample cohorts and ambitious prospective sampling. To identify clonal MM cells in the elderly before a monoclonal gammopathy can be detected, I will collect bone marrow (BM) from hundreds of hip replacement specimens, and analyze archive peripheral blood samples of thousands of healthy individuals with years of annotated clinical follow-up. This will identify early genomic alterations that are permissive to disease initiation/evolution and may serve as biomarkers for clinical screening. Through innovative, integrated single-cell genotyping and phenotyping of hundreds of asymptomatic MMs, I will functionally dissect heterogeneity and characterize the BM microenvironment to look for determinants of disease progression. Correlation with clinical outcome and mini-invasive serial sampling of circulating cell-free DNA will identify candidate biological markers to better predict evolution. Last, aggressive modelling of candidate early lesions and modifier screens will offer a list of vulnerabilities that could be exploited for rationale therapies.

72	Professor Schutte Aletta	North-West University	2016-10-05	2020-02-04	The African Prospective study on the Early Detection and Identification of Cardiovascular disease and Hypertension (African-PREDICT)	Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one cause of death world-wide. But Africa is known for its tremendous burden of infectious diseases. With the introduction of antiretroviral therapy, the scene is starting to change with indicators pointing that dramatic increases in the incidence of hypertension and subsequent CVD, will overtake infectious diseases in the near future. Economic progress in African countries, come at a significant cost to the health burden. Although antihypertensive medication is highly cost-effective, the weak health systems in Africa fail to ensure awareness, treatment and control. The status quo can thus not be maintained in Africa concerning current practices to manage hypertension. It may have significantly greater impact if tailored population- and individual targeted prevention strategies are employed in the whole population, but especially in young individuals to early detect, prevent or delay hypertension onset. Such strategies should be based on (a) a clear understanding of the pathophysiological development of hypertension over time in young black populations; (b) coupled with objectively measured health behaviours. The African-PREDICT study was designed to address both aspects by longitudinally tracking and monitoring hypertension development in 1200 healthy black and white individuals (aged 20-30 years). We include apparently healthy men and women of African and European descent from low/mid/high levels of socio-economic status; with brachial blood pressure (BP) < 140 and 90 mmHg; HIV uninfected; no previous diagnosis or medication for chronic disease; and not pregnant or breastfeeding. Within a Hypertension Clinic at the North-West University in South Africa, we perform a wide range of basic and advanced measurements at each visit. We obtain: (1) Questionnaire data including medical history, social status, traditional risk factors (age, sex, smoking, alcohol intake) and dietary intake (24 hour dietary recall on 3 days within a week), personality, psychological distress and psychosocial profile; (2) Biological samples for biomarker analyses (blood, spot & 24hr urine) are preserved at -80°C. The study was designed to assess a wide range of traditional and novel biomarkers, including (i) the RAS Fingerprint™ covering 10 peptides from the renin-angiotensin system; (ii) pro-inflammatory multiplex biomarker analyses and urinary proteomic profiles; (iii) urinary metabolomics, with targeted genomics to be performed at a later stage; (3) Anthropometric measurements, bio-electrical impedance – body fat% and lean mass, and 7-day accelerometric physical activity monitoring; (4) Blood Pressure: 24-hour BP, central BP, and cardiovascular stress reactivity tests; and (5) Assessments of early target organ damage include albuminuria, carotid wall thickness and distensibility, ECG, echocardiography, pulse wave velocity, and retinal microvasculature. Since the study sample comprises participants in their twenties, we anticipate few hard end points (e.g. stroke) in the 10 years of follow-up. The focus will be on ‘soft’ surrogate end points, including changes in biomarker profiles and early target organ damage. By employing also in Africa the latest cutting-edge research on biomarkers and polyomics proven to predict hypertension and cardiovascular outcome, precision medicine may have the potential to lead to novel strategies in preventing and treating hypertension in Africa.

73	Professor Schutte Aletta	University of Zurich	2018-01-10	2022-09-30	Molecular mechanisms of CRISPR-associated genome editor nucleases	Over the last five years, RNA-guided endonucleases originating from prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas systems have emerged as powerful and versatile molecular tools for precision genome editing applications in basic research, biotechnology and molecular medicine. The nucleases Cas9 and Cas12a (Cpf1) can be readily programmed using short RNA molecules to generate targeted double-strand DNA breaks in the genome, whose subsequent repair is then exploited to engineer genetic modifications. Despite extensive studies, several aspects of the molecular mechanisms of Cas9 and Cas12a, such as initial target DNA binding and final DNA cleavage, are not fully understood. At the same time, CRISPR-Cas genome editing suffers from limitations such as off-target activity, necessitating on-going technological development to improve the specificity of genome editor nucleases for gene therapeutic applications.Building on our pioneering work in the field, the proposed research will examine the molecular interactions underpinning the activities of Cas9 and Cas12a nucleases, specifically aiming to (i) dissect the mechanisms of Cas9- mediated DNA binding and catalytic activation in Cas9, (ii) determine the structural basis of Cas9âs off-target activity, and (iii) elucidate the DNA cleavage mechanism of Cas12a. To address key steps in the molecular mechanism of Cas9, X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy will be used to determine the structures of Cas9 bound to a partially unwound DNA target and an activated-state Cas9-DNA complex trapped using engineered disulphide cross- links. Off-target activity of Cas9 will be investigated by determining a series of crystal structures of Cas9 bound to bona fide off-target DNAs in order to systematically document off-target interactions such as single-nucleotide mismatches and bulges tolerated by the nuclease. The resulting structural insights will be used to derive a comprehensive off- targeting model with improved predictive power that will subsequently be validated using DNA binding and cleavage assays in vitro and genome editing experiments in vivo. Biochemical investigations of Cas12a will initially define the order and interdependence of strand cleavage events in the canonical cis-cleavage mechanism acting on double-stranded DNA substrates. In turn, X-ray crystallographic analysis of Cas12a in complex with a crRNA guide and a single- stranded DNA target will reveal the conformational activation mechanism responsible for its recently described trans- cleavage activity. Together, these studies will pave the way for subsequent investigations of the catalytic mechanism of target DNA cleavage using time-resolved crystallography.Taking a multidisciplinary approach combining structural studies with biochemical, biophysical and genome editing experiments, the proposed studies will shed light on critical steps in the molecular mechanisms of Cas9 and Cas12a. In doing so, they will not only advance our understanding of their functions but will also provide a mechanistic framework for future structure-guided engineering of these enzymes to improve their efficiency and specificity. In particular, structural analysis of Cas9 off-target activity will be pivotal for developing new off-target prediction and diagnostic tools, as well as engineered high-fidelity Cas9 variants to address the safety of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in genetic and cellular therapies. Taken together, the proposed research will make a substantial impact on the CRISPR field and a timely contribution to harnessing the potential of CRISPR-Cas genome editing for medical applications.

T2D is a multifactorial disease, resulting from progressive alteration of insulin secretion from beta cells in pancreatic islets, on a background of resistance to insulin action in various organs and tissues, including liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. T2D heritability is estimated around 40-70%. Genome-wide association studies identified more than 90 T2D-associated common variants, but altogether they explain less than 15% of T2D inheritance. Rare loss-of-function coding variants may contribute to T2D risk. Moreover, recent studies suggested the putative impact on T2D risk of functional non-coding variants within active enhancers of pancreatic islets; but tissue-specific regulatory regions have remained largely unexplored by genetic epidemiology studies. I intend to make progress in T2D genetic epidemiology and physiology by extending genetic investigation to frequent and rare mutations in non-coding regulatory regions on a whole-genome basis. In the Reg-Seq project, I propose the next-generation sequencing (NGS) of most relevant DNA regulatory sequences of four key metabolic tissues for T2D (pancreatic islets, liver, muscle and adipose tissue) in large well-phenotyped prospective populations (N=10,000 samples), followed by a replication in additional cohorts and by comprehensive functional experiments when genetic associations are identified. This project should lead to the identification of new functional genetic markers and pathways involved in T2D risk and development, and should help to stratify the T2D population for precision medicine, which is one of the major goals of the EU-Horizon 2020 programme. Further elucidation of the missing heritability should enable a major advance in the prediction of T2D risk, which is still very poor for a genuine clinical translation.

Although the exact cause remains unknown, this immune-mediated disease is likely triggered by environmental factors in genetically predisposed individuals. I propose that epigenetic mechanisms, which regulate gene expression without affecting the genetic code, mediate the processes that cause MS and that aberrant epigenetic states can be corrected, spearheading the development of alternative therapies. We will exploit the stable and reversible nature of epigenetic marks, in particular DNA methylation, to gain insights into the novel modifiable disease mechanisms by studying the target organ in a way that has not been possible before. This highly ambitious project comprises three synergistic facets formulated in specific aims to: (i) identify epigenetic states that characterize the pathogenesis of MS, (ii) prioritize functional epigenetic states using high-throughput epigenome-screens, and (iii) develop novel approaches for precision medicine based on correcting causal epigenetic states. Our unique MS biobank combined with cutting-edge methodologies to capture pathogenic cells and measure their functional states provides a rational starting point to identify MS targets.

Although the exact cause remains unknown, this immune-mediated disease is likely triggered by environmental factors in genetically predisposed individuals. I propose that epigenetic mechanisms, which regulate gene expression without affecting the genetic code, mediate the processes that cause MS and that aberrant epigenetic states can be corrected, spearheading the development of alternative therapies. We will exploit the stable and reversible nature of epigenetic marks, in particular DNA methylation, to gain insights into the novel modifiable disease mechanisms by studying the target organ in a way that has not been possible before. This highly ambitious project comprises three synergistic facets formulated in specific aims to: (i) identify epigenetic states that characterize the pathogenesis of MS, (ii) prioritize functional epigenetic states using high-throughput epigenome-screens, and (iii) develop novel approaches for precision medicine based on correcting causal epigenetic states.

Immunotherapies with checkpoint blockers have shown remarkable clinical effects and have been already approved for the treatment of different advanced cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, durable responses are obtained only in a fraction of patients suggesting the presence of different mechanisms of immune evasion and underlining the need for biomarkers to monitor and predict the response to cancer immunotherapy. We advocate that the biomarkers proposed so far fail to predict the response to immunotherapy because they do not recapitulate the immune contexture (i.e. the type, density, location, and functional orientation of tumor-infiltrating immune cells) and the mechanisms of immune escape. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies can provide the information necessary to portray the molecular landscape of the tumor and its immune contexture: the tumor-immune interface. However, as of today, there are no methods available to reconstruct the tumor-immune interface from NGS data and there is an urgent need to develop bioinformatics tools and pipelines. This project aims at the development of a computational pipeline for the reconstruction of a high-resolution map of the tumor-immune interface in NSCLC. The pipeline will use whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data to extract the features describing the immune contexture and the mutational status of NSCLC tumors. In particular, we will develop a novel deconvolution algorithm for the quantification of immune cells from lung tumor RNA-seq data. Within this project, we will use ten NSCLC tumors to generate single-cell RNA-seq data to develop the deconvolution method, plus bulk RNA-seq and digital pathology images for its validation. The computational pipeline will be applied to WES and RNA-seq data from fifty NSCLC patients treated with checkpoint blockers to unravel the mechanisms of immune evasion that hamper the efficacy of immunotherapy. The computational pipeline developed by this project will be a valuable resource for precision medicine, whereas the insights derived from the reconstruction of the tumor-immune interface in NSCLC might lay the foundations for future mechanistic studies on resistance to therapy and for the rational design of combination therapies for a cancer type that has a high incidence and mortality worldwide. All computational methods will be developed by the applicant, supported by the infrastructure and personnel of the Division of Bioinformatics, headed by Dr. Zlako Trajanoski (Innsbruck Medical University, Austria).

TBI is a major challenge for healthcare providers and poses an enormous economic burden. For decades, TBI has been characterized by severity of symptoms for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. However, this classification system is limited since it does not allow to predict long-term outcome after TBI. This state of affairs thus hinders the advancement of TBI research and the development of therapies. The field is thus in dire need of a novel understanding and classification of the individual’s response to brain injury and, most importantly, a fresh perspective on potential targets for effective treatment and prevention of long-term impairment. My main hypothesis is that brain injury leads to a neurosteroid response with inter-individual variability and that this response is associated with the trajectory of recovery. I further hypothesize, that the most vulnerable patient cohorts, such as adolescent girls, show distinct patterns of neurosteroid response associated with an increased risk for persistent symptoms. NEUROPRECISE proposes a longitudinal cohort study 1) to characterize neurosteroid response with respect to age and sex in children and adolescents with TBI, 2) to evaluate the association of the neuroimaging derived individual injury profile with neurosteroid response, and 3) to explore individual differences in neurosteroid response as a potential target for acute therapy and prevention of chronic symptoms with respect to age and sex in a rodent model. NEUROPRECISE will overcome a critical barrier towards the treatment of TBI by establishing a novel, biological-driven way to stratify TBI patients based on inter-individual differences in the response to TBI. By exploring the individual neurosteroid response as potential therapeutic target, NEUROPRECISE will bring the power of precision medicine to neurotrauma research.

The number of liver cancer-related deaths in Europe in 2018 amounted to 77 375, and this number is expected to keep rising, reaching an estimated number of more than 100 000 deaths in 2040 (IARC). Major causes include the hepatitis B and C viruses, alcoholism, Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis. All of these medical conditions trigger liver fibrosis by damaging the liver and are closely associated with the development of HCC. As a matter of fact, more than 80% of HCC develop in fibrotic or cirrhotic livers. Early stages of liver cancer do not usually produce symptoms, and many challenges are associated with the screening of HCC, leading to its late diagnosis. The absence of effective drug treatment for HCC makes its resection the first curative option with most of the patients experiencing HCC recurrence within 5 years. All these factors contribute to the poor prognosis of the HCC patients. Sorafenib is the only currently approved systemic therapy for advanced HCC in the EU, only prolonging survival by an average of 3 months, the treatment often leads to drug resistance. Indeed, intra-tumor heterogeneity strongly constrains the therapeutic benefit of precision medicine and triggers drug-resistant sub-population of cells. Consequently, persistent treatment of drug-resistant tumor cells may accelerate tumor progression, suggesting that inappropriate and continual use of a compound on drug-resistant cancer cells is not recommended. Thus, there is an urgent unmet medical need to identify and to validate the therapeutic efficacy of new valuable molecules – i.e. targeting the existing drug-resistant cell populations -that could be used in monotherapy or in combination therapy with FDA-approved drugs to improve HCC treatment responses.

Dr. Shen-Orr is a leading expert in high resolution longitudinal profiling with applications in immune ageing. Dr. Bendayan is an expert in longitudinal data analysis techniques with applications in cognitive ageing. The combinations of their areas of expertise and research interests could provide new ways of understanding changes in these areas in ageing population. In this visit, we aim to identify opportunities of translation of the combination of both approaches to precision medicine and design a roadmap for potential collaborative projects. On one side, Shen-Orr & Furman (2013) highlighted that variability in immune phenotypes increases with age which is likely to be associated to an individual's life course health trajectories; and they proposed to consider the changes in the variance of immunological parameters as different immune trajectories of ageing. On the other side, Bendayan has also found that there is an increase in variability in cognitive phenotypes with age (e.g., Bendayan et al., 2018; Davis, Bendayan et al, 2017) which might be associated to other health conditions which in turn are known to be linked to the immunological markers (e.g., Miller & Raison, 2016). Given this context, we propose to explore the association between immune and cognitive markers in older populations, first in data collected for research purposes to which we have already access and then tailor this approach to its potential application to electronic health records. Following, Shen-Orr & Furman (2013) we hypothesize that older individuals with lower variance in immunological parameters will show a cognitive performance above average for their age and in this groups of individuals we will find common protective factors in their life course associated. In addition, both researchers are interested in improving techniques for longitudinal analysis and while they share applications there is a great opportunity to share expertise from statistical and highly computational backgrounds.

Realistic mechanistic models are needed to understand and limit heterogeneity in drug responses. Consequently, novel approaches are required that explicitly account for individual variations in response to environmental influences, in addition to genetic variation. The human gut microbiota metabolizes drugs and is modulated by diet, and it exhibits significant variation among individuals. However, the influence of the gut microbiota on drug failure or drug side effects is under-researched. In this study, I will combine whole-body, genome-scale molecular resolution modeling of human metabolism and human gut microbial metabolism, which represents a network of genes, proteins, and biochemical reactions, with physiological, clinically relevant modeling of drug responses. I will perform two pilot studies on human subjects to illustrate that this innovative, versatile computational modeling framework can be used to stratify patients prior to drug prescription and to optimize drug bioavailability through personalized dietary intervention. With these studies, BugTheDrug will advance mechanistic understanding of drug-microbiota-diet interactions and their contribution to individual drug responses. I will perform the first integration of cutting-edge approaches and novel insights from four distinct research areas: systems biology, quantitative systems pharmacology, microbiology, and nutrition. BugTheDrug conceptually and technologically addresses the demand for novel approaches to the study of individual variability, thereby providing breakthrough support for progress in precision medicine.

By embedding ratiometric fluorescent particle-based sensors within 3D scaffolds, the changes in target analyte concentrations can be monitored and used to study the interactions between tumour cells and stromal cells in 3D tumoroids/scaffolds and to monitor response of the cells to drug treatments. I first demonstrated successful fabrication of barcoded capsules for multiplex sensing of H+, K+, and Na+ ions. Next, I demonstrated the use of pH-sensing capsules as valid real time optical reporter tools to sense and monitor intracellular acidification in living cells. Thus, I can fabricate capsule sensors for investigating the role of key analytes that are involved in regulation of crucial physiological mechanisms. In addition, I successfully integrated pH-sensing capsules within 3D nanofibrous matrices and demonstrated their operation under pH switches. INTERCELLMED will engineer 3D scaffolds that do not only sense extracellular pH but are also able to sense K+ and O2 changes. To this aim, a novel set of anisotropic analyte-sensitive ratiometric capsules will be developed and applied for generating robust and flexible capsules-embedded sensing scaffolds. To validate the functions of the 3D sensing platform, cocoltures of tumour cells and stromal cells will be grown and their interaction and response to drug treatments will be studied by mapping the K+/H+/O2 gradients in and around the cell aggregates. Finally, the 3D sensing platform will be adapted for growing tumour tissue-derived cells that will be tested ex-vivo with anticancer dugs.

Acquisition, analysis, and sharing of such data is a priority on the agenda of 2016 and beyond. In the US, a number of initiatives are taking place to coordinate and harmonize high quality collection and analysis of health data to enable precision medicine and to rationalize treatment of chronic diseases. The aim is to obtain comprehensive comparative data for evidence-based public health and health care. In order to advance smarter medicine, in the US a number of data collection initiatives exist where data from ambulatory or inpatient hospital care is collected routinely and helps to identify better measures and to answer critical questions in the clinical research agenda. Examples are the outpatient clinical registry called “Guideline Advantage (TGA)”, or the National Hospital Care Survey NHCS and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, NHAMCS. To improve evidence-based, smart health care, data from various hospitals, ambulatory care providers, researchers and insurance companies should be combined. Thus, the concept that collection and analysis of health data can remain the task of “a single investigator in a single laboratory for a single purpose” needs to be abandoned. Integrating such local and national data into a coherent network of resources and infrastructure that allows for the efficient and ethical sharing of data, as recommended by the NIH, is urgently needed in Switzerland. At present, data collecting entities tend to prefer using their own clinical or other indicators for success and outcome which is a clear weakness for the Swiss health care system. Efforts are urgently needed to improve (i.) standardization and comparability of data and indicators, (ii.) availability of data from different sources including insurance companies, (iii.) increased veracity and (iv.) completeness of data, comprising the routine collection of valid health and quality indicators. Within and across countries, collaborative acquisition and analysis of comparable health data (and biological samples) is hampered by a number of barriers. In comparison to other European countries and the US, Switzerland is lagging behind. While some barriers, such as the cantonal structure, are evident, others are yet unknown and need urgently to be assessed in more detail, in order to enable smarter health care in Switzerland. The present project will build on previous experience of the two main applicants. BE has worked on barriers to sharing concerning genetic databanks and TP is an expert in health care quality control and evaluation. The aim of this project is to provide urgently needed knowledge on how to overcome barriers to implement high quality, comparable health data collection in Switzerland. The study is at the same time an intervention towards the facilitation of smart data collection as it will not only obtain knowledge, but make key stakeholders and decision makers aware of the need for harmonized good quality data and involve them actively in the search for solutions to overcome barriers.Objectives, methods and study parts are the following:i.Identify success mechanisms, barriers and needs in Switzerland: using a literature search and theoretical analysis, we will describe factors that facilitated past success stories of harmonized health data collection in Switzerland (e.g. HIV-cohort, SAPALDIA, CHUV-biobank), analyse what is known about barriers, and identify needs in Switzerland, e.g. types of needed data, including harmonised tools and indicators used abroad and susceptible to be useful in Switzerland. This includes an assessment of legal and ethical barriers.ii.Explore success factors in other countries: semi-structured interviews will be conducted with approximately 15-25 decision makers and experts in institutions that developed efficient data collection tools in other countries, including those with health care systems comparable to Switzerland. iii.Understand decision makers and key stakeholders’ attitudes and knowledge to identify barriers and propose concrete solutions via a Delphi process: semi-structured interviews will be carried out with 20-30 hospital directors, hospital data managers, insurance company representatives and other stakeholders involved in or influencing collection of relevant data in Switzerland and 20-30 health data researchers and Swiss data experts. The Delphi approach will be concluded using a questionnaire and workshops that extend into part iv.iv.Inform and disseminate findings: this objective is already integrated in part iii. as experts and stakeholders will not only be asked about their experience and attitudes, but also informed about needs and facilitators identified in parts i. and ii. Study results will also be disseminated through the usual scientific vectors (conferences, publications etc.).v.Based on expert consensus, produce concrete, detailed and practically useful recommendations to inform policy makers how to reduce barriers and further good quality health data collection in Switzerland.

Substantial evidence suggests that early-onset metabolic changes precede cardiac dysfunction, and that improving mitochondrial activity may better protect the heart against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (DC). Several food supplements are suspected to boost mitochondrial metabolic activity, but it is unknown whether they avert the chemotherapy-induced metabolic changes. Knowledge of such changes could lead to a better understanding of DC that might improve cancer treatment and outcome. However, no means have been available to detect such metabolic changes in vivo.Recently, hyperpolarized (HP) magnetic resonance (MR) technology demonstrated the measurement of real-time metabolic activity in vivo after the injection of HP 13C labeled metabolites. Using HP metabolic imaging, early onset metabolic changes were visualized in a diseased large animal model, and the technology was translated to image prostate cancer in patients in 2013. A significant hurdle in the clinical translation of HP MR is the presence of toxic free radicals that necessitates a time-consuming filtration process. However, exciting recent findings showed that HP metabolic imaging of pure, radical-free metabolite solutions is possible.In this proposal, the researcher will develop novel “radical-free” HP MR technology for metabolic imaging in vivo using advanced image reconstruction methods. She will establish a link between in vivo metabolic changes and the level of DC, and investigate whether this damage can be prevented with novel food supplements. HP MR enables the real-time measurement of biochemical processes, which has never been possible before. If heart failure progression in DC can be monitored with HP MR, and averted, this would improve the understanding of cardiotoxic mechanisms and support the design of precision medicine through strategies aimed at minimizing cardiotoxicity, knowledge that can be translated to patients or even allow for individualized therapy. The proposed study is novel because the hyperpolarization of metabolites without adding radicals is revolutionary, and the application of CS to metabolic imaging of the heart is innovative. This will be the first study to develop radical-free HP metabolic imaging for the heart, and the first to identify and quantify the in vivo metabolic biomarkers associated with DC. Furthermore we will establish the cardioprotective effect of NR.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Ambizione	597056.0CHF

Our lack of knowledge on the functional consequences of the vast majority of genetic variation is one of the fundamental problems impeding such endeavors. While naturally occurring variants have the most relevance for explaining phenotypic diversity, systematic genome perturbations have primarily been focused on large-effect alleles, such as gene deletions. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping have addressed the role of natural variation in conditioning complex traits, but these approaches are limited by the haplotypes present in the population and are poorly equipped to detect interactions between loci - situations where the effect of one variant is masked or enhanced by another variant. It has become clear that a comprehensive view of genetic variation and its role in shaping phenotypes requires systematic perturbation of each variant in different genetic and environmental contexts. Recent advances in genome engineering now make such an approach possible. Here I propose to systematically engineer and phenotype naturally occurring single nucleotide variants and small insertion-deletion polymorphisms in three distinct Saccharomyces cerevisiae backgrounds. The strains will be constructed by a high-throughput CRISPR approach that allows creation of thousands of barcoded and sequence-verified variant strains simultaneously. I will profile strain pools in multiple environments, identifying those variants that modulate fitness in a given environment and genetic background by next-generation sequencing of genomically integrated DNA barcodes. To map pairwise and higher-order interactions I will then directly engineer variant combinations and assay their impact on cellular processes and fitness. The work in this proposal will be an important contribution towards understanding the phenotypic landscape governed by natural variants and their interaction with each other and the environment. Due to the conservation of fundamental cellular processes, the here identified principles underlying allelic interactions will allow valuable insights into the organizing principles of cellular systems. By enabling the interpretation of genetic variation in specific biological and environmental contexts these insights lay the foundation for efforts to predict the phenotype of a cell based on its genotype and environment alone.

96	Dr Figueroa Jonine	University of Zurich	2017-02-01	2019-01-31	Digital Cancer Biobank - zBioLink	The recent dramatic success of immune checkpoint inhibitors has been a long awaited revolution in cancer treatment. Combined with the broad adoption of next-generation-sequencing (NGS) and functional drug screening techniques, the face of biomedical research is changing rapidly. In the future, routine molecular analysis and in vitro pharmacological testing will support patient-tailored therapies. But our understanding of how particular features in high-dimensional datasets contribute to or predict therapeutic response is still in its infancy. Thus, the current proposal is intended to link various biobanks at the University Hospital Zürich (USZ) to follow-up on an initial study by the group of Prof. Mitch Levesque (co-leader of this proposal) that identified a significant predictive biomarker of response to both currently available immune checkpoint inhibitors in melanoma (anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1).Clinical cancer specimens are unique and finite. They are also a critical foundation for precision medicine (PM). In general, clinical specimens such as blood, tissue or cell samples are annotated and stored in biospecimen banks (biobanks) that are typically associated with and maintained by a specific clinical center. In this interdisciplinary BioLink project, we propose to generate a digital biobank of melanoma specimens and living cells by linking the resources of at least two departments (Dept. of Dermatology & Pathology, and potentially Oncology and Hematology), where the genomic and pharmacological information is recorded and presented in searchable, digital files that are stored with the clinical metadata in a database. This pioneering project builds on a worldwide unique collection of tissue specimens and data acquisition techniques present in Zürich. It has the potential to transform PM by making data that represents the quantitative molecular and functional makeup of clinical samples accessible for research. This project will address the urgent clinical need of establishing a better stratification of metastatic melanoma patients for the most efficacious therapy. This will be based on the methods developed by the group of Prof. Levesque and recently presented at ASCO 2016. But in order to validate and expand their findings, it is necessary to gather the relevant data and samples from the USZ in three well-defined steps. The first is to establish the laboratory information system SLims (Genohm SA, Lausanne) by linking two established physical tissue and cell biobanks at the University Hospital Zürich (Dept. of Pathology and Dermatology), the second is to establish database capabilities, data analytics, and visualization tools (cBioPortal, The Hyve, Cambridge, USA) to support in silico research with the available genomic and clinical/phenotypic metadata, and the third is to define personalized, rationally chosen treatment regimens for each individual melanoma patient to prolong life after ex vivo pharmacologic testing of melanoma cells (precision medicine).We will meet these important challenges through the development and the implementation of a new, integrated strategy that is focused on the combined analysis of immune signatures and genetics as well as all available clinical parameters. Our two-year project will be initiated and made feasible by focusing on malignant melanoma and builds on the results and advances achieved by the project team. In the past, the applicants have successfully established facilities to convert physical specimens into digital files representing their genomic states. A pilot program of a carefully selected set of 150 specimens will be carried out, comparing features of tumors and matching living cells. Specifically, the unique technical capabilities and resources the project team will bring to bear on melanoma include 1) unique, annotated clinical tissue and cell resources including the two largest cancer tissue and cell biobanks in Switzerland, 2) technologies to generate genetic barcodes and drug response data of melanoma samples in a high-throughput manner, 3) a novel framework (Oracle Translational Research Center Platform) for linking metadata in the clinic, and 4) (bio-) informatics tools to define and visualize the networks perturbed in melanoma. Associated challenges will be solved by the development of a digital biobank application, using the cBioPortal software (The Hyve, Cambridge) that visualizes different biobanking initiatives. Another result and unique feature of the project will be the prospective generation of a digital biobank sui generis for all types of disease, called zBioLink. Besides conventional tissue and cell samples, sequencing results will be systematically collected and integrated with clinical outcome information and pharmacological in vitro data. The project will extend the current histopathological and genetic characterization of cancer tissue to the level of functional drug response data. In addition, the zBioLink project will establish a general framework for bringing basic research discoveries to the clinics for patients’ benefit and provide an environment for clinical and basic scientists to collaborate efficiently. The project team has already implemented a tumor-board in molecular-oncology and immuno-oncology at the University Hospital Zürich, where selected patients from the pilot study with metastatic disease can be discussed. Access to data will be provided by the Research Data Service Center, USZ. The project will democratize precision medicine research by linking these efforts and presenting the data of tissues and living cells in a graphical user interface (zBioLink). Linked biobank databases of this scale will facilitate the realization of systems medicine as a milestone on the way to an effective PM program that enables the identification of predictive biomarkers and potential drug targets across large cohorts of cancer patients. We anticipate that the project will be completed within two years. Alignment with national initiatives (Swiss Biobanking Platform, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics) is intended to allow for collaborations and harmonization of standards across Switzerland.

In contrast to conventional radiological image analysis, this methodology is a) objective and observer-independent and b) allows for a comprehensive description of all available information within medical images. Radiomics is therefore considered as a potential addition to the efforts currently undertaken in the field of precision medicine: to achieve a comprehensive analysis of the cancer phenotype in order to adjust the treatment to the patient-individual cancer characteristics.The aim of this project is to establish and to use comprehensive radiomics analyses in CT and FDG-PET images for outcome modelling. Prior to all image analyses, the radiomics algorithms will be evaluated regarding their robustness against non-standardized image acquisition and image reconstruction parameters. In addition, a model for quantification of loco-regional tumor spread will be established and its prognostic and predictive value will be compared to the conventional staging system. Machine learning algorithms will be established to correlate the large amount of radiomics biomarkers with clinical outcome parameters. The radiomics methodology will be tested based on images acquired within the randomized SAKK 16-00 study of multi-modality treatment for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Radiomics biomarkers of pre-treatment CT and FDG-PET images, or post induction therapy images and changes of radiomics parameters between these two time points will be analysed. Radiomics parameters will be correlated with available histo-pathological tumor characteristics, primary (event-free survival) and secondary (overall survival, response to induction therapy, failure pattern, pulmonary toxicity) study endpoints.It is the hypothesis, that radiomics analyses will enable us to build better and more accurate prognostic models than the ones currently based on the TNM system as well as predictive models for identification of patients, who might benefit from neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy instead of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, only.The radiomics methodology and the machine learning algorithms will be evaluated in cancer patients suffering from NSCLC, a disease with currently very poor prognosis. It is planned to evaluate radiomics and the machine learning algorithms in other cancer sites as well. Additionally, the application of radiomics and the machine learning algorithms are not restricted to Oncology but can maybe successfully used in other medical questions.

Immunotherapies with checkpoint blockers have shown remarkable clinical effects and have been already approved for the treatment of different advanced cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, durable responses are obtained only in a fraction of patients suggesting the presence of different mechanisms of immune evasion and underlining the need for biomarkers to monitor and predict the response to cancer immunotherapy. We advocate that the biomarkers proposed so far fail to predict the response to immunotherapy because they do not recapitulate the immune contexture (i.e. the type, density, location, and functional orientation of tumor-infiltrating immune cells) and the mechanisms of immune escape. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies can provide the information necessary to portray the molecular landscape of the tumor and its immune contexture: the tumor-immune interface. However, as of today, there are no methods available to reconstruct the tumor-immune interface from NGS data and there is an urgent need to develop bioinformatics tools and pipelines. This project aims at the development of a computational pipeline for the reconstruction of a high-resolution map of the tumor-immune interface in NSCLC. The pipeline will use whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data to extract the features describing the immune contexture and the mutational status of NSCLC tumors. In particular, we will develop a novel deconvolution algorithm for the quantification of immune cells from lung tumor RNA-seq data. Within this project, we will use ten NSCLC tumors to generate single-cell RNA-seq data to develop the deconvolution method, plus bulk RNA-seq and digital pathology images for its validation. The computational pipeline will be applied to WES and RNA-seq data from fifty NSCLC patients treated with checkpoint blockers to unravel the mechanisms of immune evasion that hamper the efficacy of immunotherapy. The computational pipeline developed by this project will be a valuable resource for precision medicine, whereas the insights derived from the reconstruction of the tumor-immune interface in NSCLC might lay the foundations for future mechanistic studies on resistance to therapy and for the rational design of combination therapies for a cancer type that has a high incidence and mortality worldwide.

All computational methods will be developed by the applicant, supported by the infrastructure and personnel of the Division of Bioinformatics, headed by Dr. Zlako Trajanoski (Innsbruck Medical University, Austria). The optimization of the methods for single-cell RNA-seq will be performed in collaboration with Dr. Barbara Di Camillo (University of Padova, Italy). Retrospective and prospective data from NSCLC patients will be collected in cooperation with Dr. Gabriele Gamerith (Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria) and Dr. Michele Maio (University Hospital of Siena, Italy)	Medical Research Council	Fellowship	261847.0GBP

TBI is a major challenge for healthcare providers and poses an enormous economic burden. For decades, TBI has been characterized by severity of symptoms for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. However, this classification system is limited since it does not allow to predict long-term outcome after TBI. This state of affairs thus hinders the advancement of TBI research and the development of therapies. The field is thus in dire need of a novel understanding and classification of the individual’s response to brain injury and, most importantly, a fresh perspective on potential targets for effective treatment and prevention of long-term impairment. My main hypothesis is that brain injury leads to a neurosteroid response with inter-individual variability and that this response is associated with the trajectory of recovery. I further hypothesize, that the most vulnerable patient cohorts, such as adolescent girls, show distinct patterns of neurosteroid response associated with an increased risk for persistent symptoms. NEUROPRECISE proposes a longitudinal cohort study 1) to characterize neurosteroid response with respect to age and sex in children and adolescents with TBI, 2) to evaluate the association of the neuroimaging derived individual injury profile with neurosteroid response, and 3) to explore individual differences in neurosteroid response as a potential target for acute therapy and prevention of chronic symptoms with respect to age and sex in a rodent model. NEUROPRECISE will overcome a critical barrier towards the treatment of TBI by establishing a novel, biological-driven way to stratify TBI patients based on inter-individual differences in the response to TBI. By exploring the individual neurosteroid response as potential therapeutic target, NEUROPRECISE will bring the power of precision medicine to neurotrauma research.

The number of liver cancer-related deaths in Europe in 2018 amounted to 77 375, and this number is expected to keep rising, reaching an estimated number of more than 100 000 deaths in 2040 (IARC). Major causes include the hepatitis B and C viruses, alcoholism, Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis. All of these medical conditions trigger liver fibrosis by damaging the liver and are closely associated with the development of HCC. As a matter of fact, more than 80% of HCC develop in fibrotic or cirrhotic livers. Early stages of liver cancer do not usually produce symptoms, and many challenges are associated with the screening of HCC, leading to its late diagnosis. The absence of effective drug treatment for HCC makes its resection the first curative option with most of the patients experiencing HCC recurrence within 5 years. All these factors contribute to the poor prognosis of the HCC patients. Sorafenib is the only currently approved systemic therapy for advanced HCC in the EU, only prolonging survival by an average of 3 months, the treatment often leads to drug resistance. Indeed, intra-tumor heterogeneity strongly constrains the therapeutic benefit of precision medicine and triggers drug-resistant sub-population of cells. Consequently, persistent treatment of drug-resistant tumor cells may accelerate tumor progression, suggesting that inappropriate and continual use of a compound on drug-resistant cancer cells is not recommended. Thus, there is an urgent unmet medical need to identify and to validate the therapeutic efficacy of new valuable molecules – i.e. targeting the existing drug-resistant cell populations -that could be used in monotherapy or in combination therapy with FDA-approved drugs to improve HCC treatment responses.

113	Dr Jones Robert	University of Glasgow	2015-08-01	2017-07-31	A clinical research fellowship in cancer clinical trials	Background. Clinical research in cancer in general, and clinical trials research in particular, is essential for the translation of new scientific findings into clinical practice. Whilst clinical research remains part of the day-to-day activity of many practising oncologists, there is a need for a cadre of highly trained clinical trials research specialists to lead the development of clinical trials in the future. Aims. To provide an opportunity for a highly able cancer physician in training to become a clinical trials research specialist. To enable delivery of umbrella precision-medicine phase II trials in urothelial and pancreatic cancers. Methods. The fellow will spend 2 years working in the CRUK Glasgow Clinical Trials Unit learning the skills involved in clinical trial initiation, design, delivery, analysis and publication. This will be achieved by working across a small portfolio of trials with the common theme of employing precision medicine to deliver new therapeutic concepts to improve outcomes for patients with cancer. By cross-portfolio working, the fellow will gain experience at all stages in clinical trial development. In addition, the fellow will develop a number of studies exploring aspects of delivery of precision medicine trials in these groups of patients. How the results will be used. Although the fellow will be engaged in project work around specific clinical trials, it is not the intention of this specific fellowship award to generate final trial results. Moreover, the primary output of this project will be the successful training of a high-calibre clinical trials specialist. This individual will go on to become a leading chief investigator in their own area of cancer research and practice and will ultimately become a leader of clinical cancer research.

While targeted therapies exist for individual patient subtypes, cytotoxic chemotherapy remains important for all subgroups. The success of chemotherapy is limited by drug resistance and toxicities. The duocarmycins are ultrapotent cytotoxins, which evade multidrug resistance and DNA repair mechanisms, but proved too toxic for human use. Targeted delivery of duocarmycins has the potential to increase therapeutic index. Aims We will apply the principles of precision medicine to the delivery of a novel, dual-targeted duocarmycin cytotoxic prodrug activated by tumour membrane-type matrix metalloproteinases, and demonstrate pre-clinical proof-of-concept to underpin early clinical trials in women with mBC. Techniques and Methodology We will employ an iterative approach to compound synthesis, informed by detailed LC-MS-based ex vivo metabolism studies developed in our laboratory. These assays will assess prodrug activation in tumour tissues and stability in normal tissues (plasma, liver, kidney, lung) at the bench, and will predict in vivo pharmacokinetics. Two prodrugs will be identified for in vivo evaluation of the maximum-tolerated dose and pharmacokinetics, prior to selecting one candidate for efficacy studies in relevant murine models. Impact on breast cancer research If successful this will be a first-in-class, novel potential therapeutic, and provide a rationale for a clinical trial. This project has significant potential to improve the quantity and quality of life for countless mBC patients, regardless of molecular subtype.	Breast Cancer Now	Project	194318.0GBP

The nucleases Cas9 and Cas12a (Cpf1) can be readily programmed using short RNA molecules to generate targeted double-strand DNA breaks in the genome, whose subsequent repair is then exploited to engineer genetic modifications. Despite extensive studies, several aspects of the molecular mechanisms of Cas9 and Cas12a, such as initial target DNA binding and final DNA cleavage, are not fully understood. At the same time, CRISPR-Cas genome editing suffers from limitations such as off-target activity, necessitating on-going technological development to improve the specificity of genome editor nucleases for gene therapeutic applications.Building on our pioneering work in the field, the proposed research will examine the molecular interactions underpinning the activities of Cas9 and Cas12a nucleases, specifically aiming to (i) dissect the mechanisms of Cas9- mediated DNA binding and catalytic activation in Cas9, (ii) determine the structural basis of Cas9âs off-target activity, and (iii) elucidate the DNA cleavage mechanism of Cas12a. To address key steps in the molecular mechanism of Cas9, X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy will be used to determine the structures of Cas9 bound to a partially unwound DNA target and an activated-state Cas9-DNA complex trapped using engineered disulphide cross- links. Off-target activity of Cas9 will be investigated by determining a series of crystal structures of Cas9 bound to bona fide off-target DNAs in order to systematically document off-target interactions such as single-nucleotide mismatches and bulges tolerated by the nuclease. The resulting structural insights will be used to derive a comprehensive off- targeting model with improved predictive power that will subsequently be validated using DNA binding and cleavage assays in vitro and genome editing experiments in vivo. Biochemical investigations of Cas12a will initially define the order and interdependence of strand cleavage events in the canonical cis-cleavage mechanism acting on double-stranded DNA substrates. In turn, X-ray crystallographic analysis of Cas12a in complex with a crRNA guide and a single- stranded DNA target will reveal the conformational activation mechanism responsible for its recently described trans- cleavage activity. Together, these studies will pave the way for subsequent investigations of the catalytic mechanism of target DNA cleavage using time-resolved crystallography.Taking a multidisciplinary approach combining structural studies with biochemical, biophysical and genome editing experiments, the proposed studies will shed light on critical steps in the molecular mechanisms of Cas9 and Cas12a. In doing so, they will not only advance our understanding of their functions but will also provide a mechanistic framework for future structure-guided engineering of these enzymes to improve their efficiency and specificity. In particular, structural analysis of Cas9 off-target activity will be pivotal for developing new off-target prediction and diagnostic tools, as well as engineered high-fidelity Cas9 variants to address the safety of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in genetic and cellular therapies. Taken together, the proposed research will make a substantial impact on the CRISPR field and a timely contribution to harnessing the potential of CRISPR-Cas genome editing for medical applications.

Off-target activity of Cas9 will be investigated by determining a series of crystal structures of Cas9 bound to bona fide off-target DNAs in order to systematically document off-target interactions such as single-nucleotide mismatches and bulges tolerated by the nuclease. The resulting structural insights will be used to derive a comprehensive off- targeting model with improved predictive power that will subsequently be validated using DNA binding and cleavage assays in vitro and genome editing experiments in vivo. Biochemical investigations of Cas12a will initially define the order and interdependence of strand cleavage events in the canonical cis-cleavage mechanism acting on double-stranded DNA substrates. In turn, X-ray crystallographic analysis of Cas12a in complex with a crRNA guide and a single- stranded DNA target will reveal the conformational activation mechanism responsible for its recently described trans- cleavage activity. Together, these studies will pave the way for subsequent investigations of the catalytic mechanism of target DNA cleavage using time-resolved crystallography.Taking a multidisciplinary approach combining structural studies with biochemical, biophysical and genome editing experiments, the proposed studies will shed light on critical steps in the molecular mechanisms of Cas9 and Cas12a. In doing so, they will not only advance our understanding of their functions but will also provide a mechanistic framework for future structure-guided engineering of these enzymes to improve their efficiency and specificity. In particular, structural analysis of Cas9 off-target activity will be pivotal for developing new off-target prediction and diagnostic tools, as well as engineered high-fidelity Cas9 variants to address the safety of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in genetic and cellular therapies. Taken together, the proposed research will make a substantial impact on the CRISPR field and a timely contribution to harnessing the potential of CRISPR-Cas genome editing for medical applications.

128	Dr Dennis John	University of Lausanne	2016-09-01	2019-08-31	Modélisation, Simulation et Validation clinique des Interactions Médicamenteuses dans la Swiss HIV Cohort Study	Highly active antiretroviral treatments (ARTs) have transformed HIV infection from a deadly disease into a manageable chronic condition. As a consequence, HIV-infected individuals live longer and become older. Besides therapeutic effectiveness, drug tolerability and long term health impact become key issues for treatments to be taken indefinitely. Moroever, aging patients encounter chronic conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular problems, diabetes, neurocognitive impairement and malignancies, which lead to increasingly complex drugs associations with a high potential of drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Moreover, renal and hepatic functions become altered in a fraction of patients, necessitating appropriate treatment adjustments. Thus, HIV infection management becomes increasingly complex, not to mention metabolic complications and other cumulative deleterious effects of ARTs over decades. In addition, a significant percentage of HIV patients (up to 30% in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, SHCS) are co-infected with hepatitis C virus and are likely to receive the last wave of anti-HCV drugs. Still their drug interaction potential, notably with ARTs, and their long-term safety are incompletely characterized. More generally, most information from DDI databases used by healthcare providers is extrapolated from current knowledge of drug metabolic pathways identified in vitro, which poorly account for the complexity of multiple and opposing in vivo effects, not to mention induction or pharmacogenetic issues. In the growing movement of personalized medicine, research efforts must be pursued to improve the prescription of ARTs not only with regard to antiretroviral efficacy but also according to tolerability, long-term safety and potential DDIs, possibly modulated by patients’ pharmacogenetics traits. These issues will be best addressed by an integrated strategy of drug selection and dosage individualization based on relevant demographic/clinical factors, genetic markers (precision medicine) and measurement of circulating concentrations (Therapeutic Drug Monitoring, TDM). To this end, during the last funding period, we have:1.Developped mass spectrometry assays for the TDM of new anti-HIV and anti-HCV drugs, as well as metabolites profiles analysis in various body compartments. 2.Extended our modelling expertise from single-drug population pharmacokinetic analysis to drug-drug and drug-gene interactions studies and to the kinetics of biological markers in patients from the SHCS.3.Established a logistical framework for the prospective capture of TDM data for novel anti-HIV and anti-HCV agents. Building up on our population mass spectrometry facilities, modeling expertise and established frameworks, we intend to launch a systematic analysis of complex drug-drug interactions relevant to antiviral treatments and comedication in patients infected by HIV and/or HCV. Specifically, we propose in the present request for grant renewal: 1.Large-scale, cross-sectional capture, at the occasion of the bi-annual cohort visit of SHCS patients, of TDM samples along with relevant therapeutic information (date/time of last dose and blood sampling), not only for antiviral treatments but also for all other drugs part of their co-medication (i.e. statins, cardiovascular and psychotropic drugs, anticancer agents, etc.) 2. Multiplex mass spectrometry analyses of antiviral drugs and relevant comedication in TDM samples. 3.Population kinetic modeling of the exposure to antiviral drugs and to selected comedication in genotyped SHCS patients, which will culminate to:4. Nested case-control and network analyses of drugs-drug interactions observed in active SHCS individuals in real-life conditions, followed by model-based simulations and formal small-scale validation studies of problematic drug interactions. The major strength of this proposal is to address two key issues in current therapeutics of HIV- and/or HCV-infected patients: the complexity and the long-term consequences of treatments. This pharmacokinetic-pharmacoepidemiologic analysis will contribute to personalize drug treatment (via both pharmacogenetics and TDM) while addressing the problem of DDIs actually encountered in real-life conditions	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (special)	430500.0CHF
129	Dr Dennis John	Divison of Gastroenterology Universtiy of California Biomedical Research Facility 2 (BRF2)	2017-02-01	2017-09-30	Intestinal Reg3 lectins protect against bacterial translocation and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis	Background/Objective: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) will become the leading indication for liver transplantation in the near future. NASH is associated with obesity and intestinal dysbiosis, i.e., a change in the microbiota linked to disease, and translocation of bacterial products. Activation of toll-like receptors by components of the outer bacterial membrane leads to release of tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) and activation of hepatic TNFa receptors (TNFR), which drives the pathogenesis of NASH. Thus, the intestinal barrier has an important role in keeping bacteria at a distance to the host. Regenerating islet-derived protein (Reg) 3 lectins are antimicrobial molecules that are secreted by intestinal epithelial cells and Paneth cells as part of the innate immunity, and maintain sterility of the inner mucus layer. Reg3b and Reg3g are almost exclusively expressed in the small intestine, but not in the liver or immune cells. Reg3 lectins are regulated by interleukin (IL)-22, which is mainly released by intestinal innate lymphoid cells (ILC3). The absence of Reg3 lectins promotes translocation of viable bacteria and alcoholic liver disease. In NASH, this interrelation has not yet been investigated. Preliminary data: Pilot experiments showed that after 20 weeks of high-cholesterol, high-fructose diet (also termed fast food diet, FFD) Reg3g expression in the duodenum of C57BL/6 mice was reduced. FFD induced liver fibrosis in wild-type (WT) mice, which appeared to be worse in the absence of Reg3b, i.e. in knock-out (KO) mice. Reg3b KO mice had higher ALT levels than WT mice. Hypotheses: Based on these pilot data we hypothesize that FFD reduces expression of Reg3b and Reg3g in the small intestine of mice by lower IL-22 expression. This promotes translocation of viable bacteria and hepatic features of NASH through activation of hepatic TNFR1. Intestinal overexpression of Reg3g and abrogated hepatic TNFR1 signaling will prevent NASH, thus proving that bacteria-mediated release of TNFa in the setting of downregulated Reg3 lectins contributes to NASH. Humans with NASH are thought to have lower intestinal Reg3 expression than patients with NAFLD or normal weight controls. Specific aims: The proposed study will investigate the role of Reg3b and g on the pathogenesis of NASH. In aim 1, the effect of feeding a FFD for 20 weeks on intestinal Reg3 expression in C57BL/6 WT mice will be assessed. The role of IL-22 secreting ILC3 will be investigated to explain the findings. In aim 2, the role of Reg3b and g on dysbiosis, bacterial translocation, endotoxemia, liver inflammation and fibrosis will be investigated in mice lacking intestinal Reg3b and g expression as well as mice overexpressing intestinal Reg3g. Aim 3 will confirm the role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of NASH using mice lacking both, intestinal Reg3 lectins and TNFR1 specifically in hepatocytes. Aim 4 will investigate the expression pattern of intestinal lectins, IL-22 and lymphocytes along the small intestine in patients with NASH and NAFLD to confirm relevance of findings from aim 1-3 in humans. Future directions/Outlook: Reg3 lectins can be regarded as endogenous antibiotics. If the project reveals that Reg3 expression is reduced in NASH, and this correlates to increased hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis, this would add significantly to the importance of the gut-liver axis. Moreover, strategies that aim at inducing IL-22/Reg3 lectins might become an integral part of precision medicine in liver disease.

SYDDANSK UNIVERSITET	2019-08-01	2024-07-31	Improving health in people with multimorbidity: a paradigm shift in health care from disease-based curative models to personalized exercise therapy and self-management	The goal of this proposal is to support the paradigm shift in the health care of people with multiple chronic conditions in Europe from a focus on disease-based curative models to holistic person-centered self-care through personalized,supervised exercise therapy and education. The problem:The impact of multimorbidity on the individual and society is massive and much greater than the impact of single chronic conditions alone. However, effective treatments are missing and research and health care reinforce an inefficient and burdensome single-disease framework. The solution:Exercise has the potential to disrupt the ‘vicious cycle’ of systemic inflammation associated with chronic conditions and improve health in multimorbidity. A personalized exercise and education program aimed at supporting subsequent self-management by the individual will be developed in an interdisciplinary collaboration, building on evidence from biomarkers, patient involvement and methodological expertise. Self-reported,physiological and societal effects will be investigated in a randomized controlled trial comparing the personalized program with standard single-disease models of care. Scientific and public dissemination and implementation ensuring significant personal and societal benefit is fundamental to the proposal. The proposal is associated with high risk, as the current disease-based curative models involve treatment by several highly specialized health care providers, while the new person-centered self-management model is centered on a personalized program delivered by one health care provider. The ground-breaking nature of this proposal lies in its potential to revolutionize how health care is organized for people with multimorbidity, by giving them one primary care provider, and how we use non-surgical treatment in health care and science by bringing the concept of precision medicine into multimorbidity and utilizing it to improve treatment outcome with exercise therapy as the model.
