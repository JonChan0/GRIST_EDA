20    Professor Marais Richard    University of Manchester    2016-07-01    2021-06-30    Molecular Oncology Group    Background: Over the last 10 years, our Group has made important contributions to our understanding of the fundamental processes underlying melanoma development and progression. Our studies have had significant impact on melanoma patient care. We have developed tractable models of melanoma that have allowed us to study gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. With our move to Manchester, we have established excellent connections to clinical colleagues at the Christie NHS Foundation Trust, and developed a translational programme that aims to inform patient stratification and the clinical management of melanoma and other cancers. Aims: Our aims are: • To investigate how ultraviolet light drives melanoma development. • To develop new treatments for uveal melanoma. • To develop new drugs for melanoma and other cancers. • To develop new treatments for prostate cancer. • To develop a precision medicine platform for melanoma and other cancers. Methods: Underpinning all of our studies are the models of disease we have developed and refined over the past ten years, including genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) and patient-derived models (cell lines, PDX, CDX) models. We have extensive expertise in next generation sequencing (NGS) approaches and functional analysis of cancer biology. We will use our GEMMs to dissect the gene-gene and gene-environment interactions on melanoma development and progression, and to study responses to immunotherapies to guide optimisation of these drugs in the clinic. We will develop and study GEMMs of uveal melanoma and prostate cancer, which, coupled with analysis of patient samples, will allow us to identify novel targets and develop or optimise much-needed new therapeutic approaches for these cancers. Using patient-derived models, we will identify new therapeutic targets for melanoma and other cancers, and investigate mechanisms of resistance, allowing us to develop precision medicine approaches for melanoma and other cancers, and to develop new anti-cancer drugs. Impact: Our philosophy is that patient care should be based on improved knowledge of cancer biology. Our overarching aim is to understand the processes of cancer to develop better approaches to prevention, to develop new drugs, and to improve the clinical management of cancer patients.

21    Professor Hochhauser Daniel    University College London    2016-11-01    2021-10-31    A national post-mortem tissue collection protocol - the PEACE (Posthumous tissuE donAtion in CancEr) study    Background: The study of tumour evolution, immune-surveillance, metastatic disease and therapeutic resistance is essential for the development of precision medicine. Thus far this has generally been supported by access to tissue and blood samples, surplus to diagnostics requirements, which have been donated by living patients. However, the general lack of sufficient primary and metastatic tumour samples has often restricted cancer research to either established tumour cell lines or archival material. Aims: The aim of the centre accelerator award is to fund the infrastructure required to facilitate the collection of post-mortem tissue in patients with known metastatic cancer or primary brain tumours across several UK sites, establishing a national post-mortem tissue collection protocol. This will be based on the PEACE (Posthumous tissuE donAtion in CancEr) (REC 13/L0/0972, UCLH R&D 13/0165, UKCRN 18422) study, which is a multi-centre prospective observational study involving the collection of both tumour and normal tissue at post-mortem, blood samples for germ line DNA, circulating free DNA (cfDNA) and circulating tumour cells (CTCs). Methods: Patients with solid tumour types eligible for the study will be consented when alive, at which point blood samples will be collected. A post-mortem will be performed within 48hrs after death guided by prior imaging and post-mortem findings. Sampling will entail the excision of small amounts of tumour and normal tissue from each site of disease for snap freezing as fresh tissue as well as histopathological assessment. Where possible, multiple tumour regions will be collected. Clinical data will be collected and samples tracked using databases created by the CRUK and UCL Cancer Trials Centre. How the results of this research will be used: A study governance board will review both internal and external applications for the use of collected tissue and blood supported by independant funding. The aim is to link in with existing CRUK and non-CRUK funded studies, as well as national sequencing initiatives. Having created an unprecendented resource of tissue from highly annotated patient cohorts, this award will enable future research investigating various projects such as those investigating intratumour heterogeneity, polygenic and convergent mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies, tumour immunological landscape and neo-antigenic repertoire, the origins and evolution of metastatic subclones, tumour organoid models that efficiently represent the genetic diversity of late stage disease, and the use of cfDNA and CTCs in the context of metastatic cancer and primary brain tumours.

23    Professor Gibbins Jonathan    Reading, University of    2017-02-01    2022-01-31    Understanding differences in platelet function and regulation in health and cardiometabolic disease: towards personalised and more effective anti-platelet treatment (renewal)    Background: The study of tumour evolution, immune-surveillance, metastatic disease and therapeutic resistance is essential for the development of precision medicine. Thus far this has generally been supported by access to tissue and blood samples, surplus to diagnostics requirements, which have been donated by living patients. However, the general lack of sufficient primary and metastatic tumour samples has often restricted cancer research to either established tumour cell lines or archival material. Aims: The aim of the centre accelerator award is to fund the infrastructure required to facilitate the collection of post-mortem tissue in patients with known metastatic cancer or primary brain tumours across several UK sites, establishing a national post-mortem tissue collection protocol. This will be based on the PEACE (Posthumous tissuE donAtion in CancEr) (REC 13/L0/0972, UCLH R&D 13/0165, UKCRN 18422) study, which is a multi-centre prospective observational study involving the collection of both tumour and normal tissue at post-mortem, blood samples for germ line DNA, circulating free DNA (cfDNA) and circulating tumour cells (CTCs). Methods: Patients with solid tumour types eligible for the study will be consented when alive, at which point blood samples will be collected. A post-mortem will be performed within 48hrs after death guided by prior imaging and post-mortem findings. Sampling will entail the excision of small amounts of tumour and normal tissue from each site of disease for snap freezing as fresh tissue as well as histopathological assessment. Where possible, multiple tumour regions will be collected. Clinical data will be collected and samples tracked using databases created by the CRUK and UCL Cancer Trials Centre. How the results of this research will be used: A study governance board will review both internal and external applications for the use of collected tissue and blood supported by independant funding. The aim is to link in with existing CRUK and non-CRUK funded studies, as well as national sequencing initiatives. Having created an unprecendented resource of tissue from highly annotated patient cohorts, this award will enable future research investigating various projects such as those investigating intratumour heterogeneity, polygenic and convergent mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies, tumour immunological landscape and neo-antigenic repertoire, the origins and evolution of metastatic subclones, tumour organoid models that efficiently represent the genetic diversity of late stage disease, and the use of cfDNA and CTCs in the context of metastatic cancer and primary brain tumours.

24    Dr. GERLINGER Marco Helmut    Institute of Cancer Research    2014-10-01    2018-09-30    Genetic profiling and targeting of heterogeneous and evolving colorectal and renal cancers    Background Solid tumours can be composed of multiple genetically and functionally distinct subclones (Gerlinger et al, NEJM 2012 and Nature Genetics 2014). This intra-tumour heterogeneity (ITH) can foster adaptation to changing environments through Darwinian evolution and is likely to play an important role in the development of drug resistance. ITH is also a major hurdle for treatment personalisation as current molecular profiling methods are poorly suited for the assessment of heterogeneous tumours. Aims Anti-angiogenic therapy and combination chemotherapy are the most effective treatments for patients with metastatic clear cell renal cancers (ccRCC) and colorectal cancers (CRC), respectively. Resistance to these agents invariably occurs but the mechanisms of resistance remain poorly understood, precluding the development of more effective therapies. ITH and the evolution of subclones which are undetectable before treatment may have hampered the comprehensive identification of drug resistance drivers to date. Our aim is to characterize clonal evolution processes during therapy in ccRCC and CRC in order to identify: • recurrently selected drivers and mechanisms of drug resistance. • blood based biomarkers which can predict treatment outcomes in heterogeneous cancers. • new therapeutic approaches to prevent the evolution of drug resistance. Methods We will develop novel sequencing technologies which can reveal the subclonal composition of heterogeneous tumours in the cell-free DNA (cfDNA) extracted from blood samples. Analysis of longitudinally collected samples from patients with metastatic ccRCC during first-line anti-angiogenic therapy will reveal clonal dynamics and recurrent evolutionary trajectories. Modelling approaches will be applied to scrutinize whether drug resistance evolution can be predicted based on cfDNA profiles. The evolution of drug resistance in metastatic CRC during first-line combination chemotherapy will be studied through paired biopsies taken at diagnosis and at radiological progression. Whole-genome sequencing of these biopsies will be used to reconstruct the evolutionary histories of resistant clones and to identify drivers of resistance. Biopsy-derived primary cell cultures will be used to identify new therapeutic targets which can reverse or delay the evolution of chemotherapy resistance. How the results will be used: This project addresses a major need in translational oncology by delivering precision medicine technologies to comprehensively profile the genetics of heterogeneous cancers through minimally invasive blood tests. This should foster the development of novel treatment personalisation approaches. The identification of chemotherapy resistance mechanism and of therapeutic vulnerabilities of drug resistant CRC cells should lead to improved therapeutic strategies which will ultimately increase patient survival.

25    Professor Bliss Judith Margaret    Institute of Cancer Research    2013-10-01    2018-09-30    The Institute of Cancer Research Clinical Trials and Statistics Unit (ICR-CTSU): Striving towards tailored cancer care - changing practice through clinical trials    Background ICR-CTSU is an NCRI Accredited Clinical Trials Unit, embedded within The Institute of Cancer Research and co-located with The Royal Marsden (ICR/RM), with an established track record in undertaking high quality cancer clinical trials. ICR-CTSU's mission is to improve outcomes for cancer patients through robust clinical evaluation of new technologies, targeted therapies and molecularly stratified ?precision medicine'. Scientific Strategic Objectives ?Change clinical practice by actively pursuing the conduct of clinical trials to evaluate new technologies and to clinically qualify putative predictive validated biomarkers. ?Further develop a dynamic trials portfolio aligned with CRUK and ICR/RM strategies. ?Fully exploit data from ICR-CTSU trials to investigate effects of putative biomarkers and routinely measured disease characteristics and generate hypotheses for future research. ?Ensure sustainability of ICR-CTSU as a world leading academic CTU and its continued contribution to cancer science and patient care. Research Plan ICR-CTSU will work with key clinical and scientific opinion leaders to design, conduct and analyse clinical trials based on cutting edge research aiming to impact clinical practice worldwide. Strong quality management systems will underpin effective and efficient trial conduct. ICR-CTSU will deliver a cohesive programme of trials within focussed areas whilst developing new partnerships in others. Specific aims are: In systemic treatment of breast cancer ?Develop biomarker-driven trial platforms, incorporate surrogate endpoints for peri-operative/neoadjuvant trials and explore their potential for use in the adjuvant setting. ?Lead and/or collaborate within target-oriented and pragmatic national/international trials to further refine treatment. In systemic treatment of urological cancers ?Develop randomised phase II/III trials to define treatment strategies for metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer, incorporating biomarkers for patient selection and/or early assessment of response. ?Develop trials in the surgical urology setting, with a focus on non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. In radiotherapy, across portfolios (breast, urological and head & neck cancers) ?Deliver a coordinated programme of national trials optimising radiotherapy delivery and harnessing contemporary technologies. ?Explore relationships between efficacy and safety outcomes, aiming to personalise treatment by identifying factors predicting radiosensitivity and target radiotherapy to those with greatest clinical need. In other (rare) cancers ?Evaluate novel targeted therapies, with strategic involvement in international rare cancer initiatives, maximising opportunities for integrated translational research. How results will be used ICR-CTSU trials have changed clinical practice. Efficient trial conduct, high quality data and statistical analyses will enable trial results to be published in high quality journals bringing widespread influence and potential for impact on oncological practice.

(http://www.cancercentre.ox.ac.uk) The vision of the Centre spans the research spectrum – from fundamental sciences through the translational pipeline and into clinical care with outputs feeding back into a cycle of discovery. To deliver this vision, we have focused our activity in key themes with our investments emphasising support for translational activity. We seek to partner with other funding bodies to continue to develop our fundamental sciences and deliver our clinical trials portfolio. We also pursue collaborative opportunities with other institutions across the UK and internationally to support our research objectives. As a CRUK-funded Centre we are committed to complimenting the priorities of CRUK’s new research strategy; looking for new opportunities to support their vision to beat cancer sooner. Research Strategy The Centre focuses on its strengths in radiotherapy and early phase trials in small cohorts of molecularly stratified patients, seeking novel combinations of treatments and utilisation of cutting edge technologies. We are expanding the definition of ‘personalisation of treatment’: interlinking specific molecular and genetic patient data with functional imaging to select the most effective experimental combination of surgical, radiotherapy and systemic interventions. We are committed to delivering this vision of precision medicine, through the Precision Cancer Medicine Institute (PCMI). To achieve this bold ambition we must draw from the broad range of expertise Oxford provides; from mathematicians to surgeons, chemists to epidemiologists, biologists to medical oncologists. We will work with scientists and clinicians from a variety of disciplines and not allow traditional boundaries to prevent new collaborations. We also foster networking in the Centre creating an ongoing dialogue across our wide ranging membership, leading to collaborations with help research realise its clinical impact. Scientific Areas of Interest Our disease sites of interest reflect the breadth and depth of activity here in Oxford. We have well established programmes in breast, melanoma, colorectal, urological, sarcoma, ovarian and blood cancers, where our work integrates internal research activity from across a range of disciplines to engage or lead in national and international networks. We aim to further expand our programmes in oesophageal, pancreas, brain and lung cancers through further investment in recruitment, support of our strategic working groups and engagement with national research networks. We see these as critical areas of focus for the future; to apply our world leading research to areas which can have significant impact for patients and to support CRUK’s ambition of addressing areas of unmet need. We are also expanding our scientific focus to include emerging areas of interest including tumour immunology, clinical informatics and proton beam therapy. Other Areas of Activity We invest in underpinning platforms of support which span the breadth of our cancer research community. Schemes such as the Development Fund, our networking events and working groups, and the Centre’s Annual Symposium provide the springboard for new ideas and innovations to be launched. All members across the Centre have access to these activities, which offer the opportunity for new connections, deeper collaborations and research innovation. We also foster a culture of engagement to enable Oxford’s science and CRUK’s investment to reach a wider audience. We believe that inspiring people with our research can bring hope that beating cancer is within reach. Finally, our training programme for the Centre’s clinical and non-clinical students takes full advantage of the enriched training environment that Oxford provides and enables us to recruit the best trainees, who we hope will go on to become our future leaders. For the future, we aim to continue to raising Oxford’s national and international reputation for cancer research; driving the research agenda and delivering world-class research which will be of benefit to patients.

Our aim is to characterize clonal evolution processes during therapy in ccRCC and CRC in order to identify: • recurrently selected drivers and mechanisms of drug resistance. • blood based biomarkers which can predict treatment outcomes in heterogeneous cancers. • new therapeutic approaches to prevent the evolution of drug resistance. Methods We will develop novel sequencing technologies which can reveal the subclonal composition of heterogeneous tumours in the cell-free DNA (cfDNA) extracted from blood samples. Analysis of longitudinally collected samples from patients with metastatic ccRCC during first-line anti-angiogenic therapy will reveal clonal dynamics and recurrent evolutionary trajectories. Modelling approaches will be applied to scrutinize whether drug resistance evolution can be predicted based on cfDNA profiles. The evolution of drug resistance in metastatic CRC during first-line combination chemotherapy will be studied through paired biopsies taken at diagnosis and at radiological progression. Whole-genome sequencing of these biopsies will be used to reconstruct the evolutionary histories of resistant clones and to identify drivers of resistance. Biopsy-derived primary cell cultures will be used to identify new therapeutic targets which can reverse or delay the evolution of chemotherapy resistance. How the results will be used: This project addresses a major need in translational oncology by delivering precision medicine technologies to comprehensively profile the genetics of heterogeneous cancers through minimally invasive blood tests. This should foster the development of novel treatment personalisation approaches. The identification of chemotherapy resistance mechanism and of therapeutic vulnerabilities of drug resistant CRC cells should lead to improved therapeutic strategies which will ultimately increase patient survival.

44    Dr Waugh David    Queen's University Belfast    2015-07-01    2020-06-30    Research Resource – A national digital pathology and image analysis platform for solid tumours, complemented by a comprehensive Clinical Fellowship programme in Molecular Pathology.    Background: Molecular digital pathology (MDP) and quantitative tissue imaging are central to modern molecular pathology, biomarker discovery, clinical trials and precision medicine. Aims: This CRUK Accelerator award is aimed at establishing a MDP network of CRUK Centres, led by Belfast, to build resource and manpower, drive adoption of the technology in cancer research, integrate systems, establish technology standards and grow our reputation and leadership in this field. In tandem, this proposal aims to significantly improve UK training/education in molecular pathology, recognised as a major gap, through the establishment of an MSc-driven Fellowship Training Programme in molecular pathology. Methods: Belfast CRUK Centre will act as the lead, given its strong track record in digital pathology, molecular pathology and developing an integrated pipeline for discovery and diagnostics in cancer. The other CRUK Centres within the network have been selected where strong research programmes and collaborative opportunities will benefit from the accelerated development of DMP capacity. A number of key scientific themes will be pursued across Centres, focused on the genotyping of epithelia and immune cancer compartments in breast, lung, colorectal, prostate and CNS cancers, as well as automated tumour analysis for next generation sequencing. The over-arching goals are to provide a UK-digital hub for remote storage/sharing of tissue images, to standardise imaging methodologies, to integrate technologies and support data-exchange between Centres. Each centre is also committed to improving training and education in molecular and digital pathology training across the UK. By establishing 16 Clinical Fellowships through an MSc degree per year, over a 4 year period, delivered in Belfast with cross-centre projects, we will provide candidates with in depth experience in molecular pathology – further strengthening growth and leadership in these areas. This will establish a model for modern pathology training nationally in translational research. How results of this research will be used: The proposal will create a platform that will allow the systematic characterization of the epithelial and immune components of cancer. Initially, it will be applied to specific subgroups of breast and prostate cancers, to inform future immune therapy strategies. Furthermore, the share of technology and software licenses available to all Centres in the application will create a UK-MDP Hub, making MDP available to virtually all CR-UK driven projects. In addition, this proposal sets the basis for the systematic training of UK pathologists and scientists in molecular pathology to create a sustainable, national resource of talent.

Despite clear clinical and biological differences between individual patients with PAH the treatment is uniform, based on an algorithm that matches the number of vasodilator drugs to functional class. I aim to establish SMURF1 inhibition as a novel anti-proliferative therapy and pathway for precision medicine for patients with PAH. I have demonstrated that SMAD-specific ubiquitin ligase regulatory factor-1 (SMURF1) is critical to pulmonary vascular remodelling and experimental PAH, and that SMURF1 mRNA expression is detectable and increased in peripheral blood from patients with PAH. In November 2015 my collaborators (Novartis) patented a series of SMURF1 inhibitors. Through this Fellowship I will use cutting edge RNA and protein profling techniques to determine mechanism though which SMURF1 mediates disease pathology and, using samples and clinical data from the worlds largest and best genotyped-phenotyped cohort of patients with PAH (the UK National Cohort), investigate means of identifying patients with cellular abnormalities related to SMURF1 who may benefit from a SMURF1 targeted therapy.

47    Professor Powles Thomas    University of Glasgow    2015-02-01    2019-03-31    CRUK/14/042 ATLANTIS - Maintaining response in urothelial cancer: A personalised precision medicine trial    Background Metastatic urothelial cancer (MUC) is the eighth most common cause of cancer death in the UK. Chemotherapy is standard treatment for MUC. Although MUC is initially sensitive to chemotherapy, patients usually relapse within 6 months of completion of therapy. The outcome once relapse has occurred is very poor (median overall survival 8 months). Therefore, maintaining response to chemotherapy is an attractive goal, and a good environment for testing active single agents in MUC. ATLANTIS is a multi-arm multi-stage signal searching study. Patients will be allocated to treatment (v.s. placebo) based on biomarker expression. Aims: The study will investigate whether maintenance targeted therapy after chemotherapy, based on biomarker expression, delays time to progression and overall survival for patients with MUC. Methods: This will be a double blind randomised multi-arm randomised control, multi-centre study with the potential for the addition of new arms. The intention is that positive arms will graduate from phase II to phase III testing; the phase II outcome data may be incorporated in the phase III study. Consent for biomarker testing will take place while patients are receiving first line chemotherapy for UC. Archival tumour tissue will be collected and analysed for biomarker expression. Biomarker expression will determine which sub-study the patient will enter if they are subsequently eligible for and consent to the main study. Patients who have clinical benefit after completing at least 4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy for MUC, will be assigned to cohort 1 or cohort 2 based upon the results of their biomarker analyses (AR +ve/AR –ve). Cohort 1 (Androgen Receptor (AR) +ve Patients will be randomised to receive either: Enzalutamide 160mg daily until progression or placebo daily until progression. Cohort 2 (Androgen Receptor (AR) -ve Patients will be randomised to receive either: Cabozantinib 40mg daily until progression or placebo daily until progression. Results/Analysis: All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Progression-free survival and overall survival will be compared between the study arms in the context of a Cox model incorporating the baseline minimisation factors. At the end of the study if the observed PFS difference in favour of the experimental arm is statistically significant at 10% this will be a clear signal that a subsequent phase III study is warranted.

While targeted therapies exist for individual patient subtypes, cytotoxic chemotherapy remains important for all subgroups. The success of chemotherapy is limited by drug resistance and toxicities. The duocarmycins are ultrapotent cytotoxins, which evade multidrug resistance and DNA repair mechanisms, but proved too toxic for human use. Targeted delivery of duocarmycins has the potential to increase therapeutic index. Aims We will apply the principles of precision medicine to the delivery of a novel, dual-targeted duocarmycin cytotoxic prodrug activated by tumour membrane-type matrix metalloproteinases, and demonstrate pre-clinical proof-of-concept to underpin early clinical trials in women with mBC. Techniques and Methodology We will employ an iterative approach to compound synthesis, informed by detailed LC-MS-based ex vivo metabolism studies developed in our laboratory. These assays will assess prodrug activation in tumour tissues and stability in normal tissues (plasma, liver, kidney, lung) at the bench, and will predict in vivo pharmacokinetics. Two prodrugs will be identified for in vivo evaluation of the maximum-tolerated dose and pharmacokinetics, prior to selecting one candidate for efficacy studies in relevant murine models. Impact on breast cancer research If successful this will be a first-in-class, novel potential therapeutic, and provide a rationale for a clinical trial. This project has significant potential to improve the quantity and quality of life for countless mBC patients, regardless of molecular subtype.    Breast Cancer Now    Project    385450.96GBP

50    Blümel Sena    University of Zurich    2017-11-01    2017-12-31    Intestinal Reg3 lectins protect against bacterial translocation and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis    Background/Objective: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) will become the leading indication for liver transplantation in the near future. NASH is associated with obesity and intestinal dysbiosis, i.e., a change in the microbiota linked to disease, and translocation of bacterial products. Thus, the intestinal barrier has an important role in keeping bacteria at a distance to the host. Regenerating islet-derived protein (Reg) 3 lectins are antimicrobial molecules that are secreted by intestinal epithelial cells and Paneth cells as part of the innate immunity, and maintain sterility of the inner mucus layer. Reg3ß and Reg3? are almost exclusively expressed in the small intestine, but not in the liver or immune cells. Reg3 lectins are regulated by interleukin (IL)-22, which is mainly released by intestinal innate lymphoid cells (ILC3). The absence of Reg3 lectins promotes translocation of viable bacteria and alcoholic liver disease. In NASH, this interrelation has not yet been investigated. Hypotheses: Fast-food diet reduces expression of Reg3 lectins in the small intestine of mice by lower IL-22 expression. This promotes translocation of viable bacteria and hepatic features of NASH. Intestinal overexpression of Reg3? will prevent NASH. Humans with NASH are thought to have lower intestinal Reg3 expression than patients with NAFLD or normal weight controls. The proposed study will investigate the role of Reg3ß and ? on the pathogenesis of NASH. Molecular mechanisms were investigated in mouse models during an advanced postdoc mobility fellowship at the University of California San Diego. To test the relevance of Reg3 lectins in humans is part of a return phase fellowship in Switzerland. In patients with NASH and NAFLD the expression pattern of intestinal lectins along the small intestine will be investigated. Future directions/Outlook: Reg3 lectins can be regarded as endogenous antibiotics. If the project reveals that Reg3 expression is reduced in NASH, and this correlates to increased hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis, this would add significantly to the importance of the gut-liver axis. Moreover, strategies that aim at inducing IL-22/Reg3 lectins might become an integral part of precision medicine in liver disease.

51    Elger Bernice    University of Basel    2017-07-01    2020-12-31    Advancing SMart solutions and eliminating barriers for the Acquisition, Analysis, and Sharing of Health data in Switzerland [SMAASH]    Valid and comparable data, including outcome, diagnosis, treatment, risk factors etc., are an important means to reduce over- and underuse of resources in a smarter health care system. Acquisition, analysis, and sharing of such data is a priority on the agenda of 2016 and beyond. In the US, a number of initiatives are taking place to coordinate and harmonize high quality collection and analysis of health data to enable precision medicine and to rationalize treatment of chronic diseases. The aim is to obtain comprehensive comparative data for evidence-based public health and health care. In order to advance smarter medicine, in the US a number of data collection initiatives exist where data from ambulatory or inpatient hospital care is collected routinely and helps to identify better measures and to answer critical questions in the clinical research agenda. Examples are the outpatient clinical registry called “Guideline Advantage (TGA)”, or the National Hospital Care Survey NHCS and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, NHAMCS. To improve evidence-based, smart health care, data from various hospitals, ambulatory care providers, researchers and insurance companies should be combined. Thus, the concept that collection and analysis of health data can remain the task of “a single investigator in a single laboratory for a single purpose” needs to be abandoned. Integrating such local and national data into a coherent network of resources and infrastructure that allows for the efficient and ethical sharing of data, as recommended by the NIH, is urgently needed in Switzerland. At present, data collecting entities tend to prefer using their own clinical or other indicators for success and outcome which is a clear weakness for the Swiss health care system. Efforts are urgently needed to improve (i.) standardization and comparability of data and indicators, (ii.) availability of data from different sources including insurance companies, (iii.) increased veracity and (iv.) completeness of data, comprising the routine collection of valid health and quality indicators. Within and across countries, collaborative acquisition and analysis of comparable health data (and biological samples) is hampered by a number of barriers. In comparison to other European countries and the US, Switzerland is lagging behind. While some barriers, such as the cantonal structure, are evident, others are yet unknown and need urgently to be assessed in more detail, in order to enable smarter health care in Switzerland. The present project will build on previous experience of the two main applicants. BE has worked on barriers to sharing concerning genetic databanks and TP is an expert in health care quality control and evaluation. The aim of this project is to provide urgently needed knowledge on how to overcome barriers to implement high quality, comparable health data collection in Switzerland. The study is at the same time an intervention towards the facilitation of smart data collection as it will not only obtain knowledge, but make key stakeholders and decision makers aware of the need for harmonized good quality data and involve them actively in the search for solutions to overcome barriers.Objectives, methods and study parts are the following:i.Identify success mechanisms, barriers and needs in Switzerland: using a literature search and theoretical analysis, we will describe factors that facilitated past success stories of harmonized health data collection in Switzerland (e.g. HIV-cohort, SAPALDIA, CHUV-biobank), analyse what is known about barriers, and identify needs in Switzerland, e.g. types of needed data, including harmonised tools and indicators used abroad and susceptible to be useful in Switzerland. This includes an assessment of legal and ethical barriers.ii.Explore success factors in other countries: semi-structured interviews will be conducted with approximately 15-25 decision makers and experts in institutions that developed efficient data collection tools in other countries, including those with health care systems comparable to Switzerland. iii.Understand decision makers and key stakeholders’ attitudes and knowledge to identify barriers and propose concrete solutions via a Delphi process: semi-structured interviews will be carried out with 20-30 hospital directors, hospital data managers, insurance company representatives and other stakeholders involved in or influencing collection of relevant data in Switzerland and 20-30 health data researchers and Swiss data experts. The Delphi approach will be concluded using a questionnaire and workshops that extend into part iv.iv.Inform and disseminate findings: this objective is already integrated in part iii. as experts and stakeholders will not only be asked about their experience and attitudes, but also informed about needs and facilitators identified in parts i. and ii. Study results will also be disseminated through the usual scientific vectors (conferences, publications etc.).v.Based on expert consensus, produce concrete, detailed and practically useful recommendations to inform policy makers how to reduce barriers and further good quality health data collection in Switzerland.

In order to advance smarter medicine, in the US a number of data collection initiatives exist where data from ambulatory or inpatient hospital care is collected routinely and helps to identify better measures and to answer critical questions in the clinical research agenda. Examples are the outpatient clinical registry called “Guideline Advantage (TGA)”, or the National Hospital Care Survey NHCS and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, NHAMCS. To improve evidence-based, smart health care, data from various hospitals, ambulatory care providers, researchers and insurance companies should be combined. Thus, the concept that collection and analysis of health data can remain the task of “a single investigator in a single laboratory for a single purpose” needs to be abandoned. Integrating such local and national data into a coherent network of resources and infrastructure that allows for the efficient and ethical sharing of data, as recommended by the NIH, is urgently needed in Switzerland. At present, data collecting entities tend to prefer using their own clinical or other indicators for success and outcome which is a clear weakness for the Swiss health care system. Efforts are urgently needed to improve (i.) standardization and comparability of data and indicators, (ii.) availability of data from different sources including insurance companies, (iii.) increased veracity and (iv.) completeness of data, comprising the routine collection of valid health and quality indicators. Within and across countries, collaborative acquisition and analysis of comparable health data (and biological samples) is hampered by a number of barriers. In comparison to other European countries and the US, Switzerland is lagging behind. While some barriers, such as the cantonal structure, are evident, others are yet unknown and need urgently to be assessed in more detail, in order to enable smarter health care in Switzerland. The present project will build on previous experience of the two main applicants. BE has worked on barriers to sharing concerning genetic databanks and TP is an expert in health care quality control and evaluation. The aim of this project is to provide urgently needed knowledge on how to overcome barriers to implement high quality, comparable health data collection in Switzerland. The study is at the same time an intervention towards the facilitation of smart data collection as it will not only obtain knowledge, but make key stakeholders and decision makers aware of the need for harmonized good quality data and involve them actively in the search for solutions to overcome barriers.Objectives, methods and study parts are the following:i.Identify success mechanisms, barriers and needs in Switzerland: using a literature search and theoretical analysis, we will describe factors that facilitated past success stories of harmonized health data collection in Switzerland (e.g. HIV-cohort, SAPALDIA, CHUV-biobank), analyse what is known about barriers, and identify needs in Switzerland, e.g. types of needed data, including harmonised tools and indicators used abroad and susceptible to be useful in Switzerland. This includes an assessment of legal and ethical barriers.ii.Explore success factors in other countries: semi-structured interviews will be conducted with approximately 15-25 decision makers and experts in institutions that developed efficient data collection tools in other countries, including those with health care systems comparable to Switzerland. iii.Understand decision makers and key stakeholders’ attitudes and knowledge to identify barriers and propose concrete solutions via a Delphi process: semi-structured interviews will be carried out with 20-30 hospital directors, hospital data managers, insurance company representatives and other stakeholders involved in or influencing collection of relevant data in Switzerland and 20-30 health data researchers and Swiss data experts. The Delphi approach will be concluded using a questionnaire and workshops that extend into part iv.iv.Inform and disseminate findings: this objective is already integrated in part iii. as experts and stakeholders will not only be asked about their experience and attitudes, but also informed about needs and facilitators identified in parts i. and ii. Study results will also be disseminated through the usual scientific vectors (conferences, publications etc.).v.Based on expert consensus, produce concrete, detailed and practically useful recommendations to inform policy makers how to reduce barriers and further good quality health data collection in Switzerland.

59    Professor Schutte Aletta    North-West University    2016-10-05    2020-02-04    The African Prospective study on the Early Detection and Identification of Cardiovascular disease and Hypertension (African-PREDICT)    Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one cause of death world-wide. But Africa is known for its tremendous burden of infectious diseases. With the introduction of antiretroviral therapy, the scene is starting to change with indicators pointing that dramatic increases in the incidence of hypertension and subsequent CVD, will overtake infectious diseases in the near future. Economic progress in African countries, come at a significant cost to the health burden. Although antihypertensive medication is highly cost-effective, the weak health systems in Africa fail to ensure awareness, treatment and control. The status quo can thus not be maintained in Africa concerning current practices to manage hypertension. It may have significantly greater impact if tailored population- and individual targeted prevention strategies are employed in the whole population, but especially in young individuals to early detect, prevent or delay hypertension onset. Such strategies should be based on (a) a clear understanding of the pathophysiological development of hypertension over time in young black populations; (b) coupled with objectively measured health behaviours. The African-PREDICT study was designed to address both aspects by longitudinally tracking and monitoring hypertension development in 1200 healthy black and white individuals (aged 20-30 years). We include apparently healthy men and women of African and European descent from low/mid/high levels of socio-economic status; with brachial blood pressure (BP) < 140 and 90 mmHg; HIV uninfected; no previous diagnosis or medication for chronic disease; and not pregnant or breastfeeding. Within a Hypertension Clinic at the North-West University in South Africa, we perform a wide range of basic and advanced measurements at each visit. We obtain: (1) Questionnaire data including medical history, social status, traditional risk factors (age, sex, smoking, alcohol intake) and dietary intake (24 hour dietary recall on 3 days within a week), personality, psychological distress and psychosocial profile; (2) Biological samples for biomarker analyses (blood, spot & 24hr urine) are preserved at -80°C. The study was designed to assess a wide range of traditional and novel biomarkers, including (i) the RAS Fingerprint™ covering 10 peptides from the renin-angiotensin system; (ii) pro-inflammatory multiplex biomarker analyses and urinary proteomic profiles; (iii) urinary metabolomics, with targeted genomics to be performed at a later stage; (3) Anthropometric measurements, bio-electrical impedance – body fat% and lean mass, and 7-day accelerometric physical activity monitoring; (4) Blood Pressure: 24-hour BP, central BP, and cardiovascular stress reactivity tests; and (5) Assessments of early target organ damage include albuminuria, carotid wall thickness and distensibility, ECG, echocardiography, pulse wave velocity, and retinal microvasculature. Since the study sample comprises participants in their twenties, we anticipate few hard end points (e.g. stroke) in the 10 years of follow-up. The focus will be on ‘soft’ surrogate end points, including changes in biomarker profiles and early target organ damage. By employing also in Africa the latest cutting-edge research on biomarkers and polyomics proven to predict hypertension and cardiovascular outcome, precision medicine may have the potential to lead to novel strategies in preventing and treating hypertension in Africa.

61    Professor Carrol Enitan    University of Zurich    2017-08-01    2020-07-31    Radiomics as biomarker in multi-modality treatment of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer    Radiomics is defined as the use of quantitative image analysis algorithms for calculation of a comprehensive set of image phenotypes also called image biomarkers. In contrast to conventional radiological image analysis, this methodology is a) objective and observer-independent and b) allows for a comprehensive description of all available information within medical images. Radiomics is therefore considered as a potential addition to the efforts currently undertaken in the field of precision medicine: to achieve a comprehensive analysis of the cancer phenotype in order to adjust the treatment to the patient-individual cancer characteristics.The aim of this project is to establish and to use comprehensive radiomics analyses in CT and FDG-PET images for outcome modelling. Prior to all image analyses, the radiomics algorithms will be evaluated regarding their robustness against non-standardized image acquisition and image reconstruction parameters. In addition, a model for quantification of loco-regional tumor spread will be established and its prognostic and predictive value will be compared to the conventional staging system. Machine learning algorithms will be established to correlate the large amount of radiomics biomarkers with clinical outcome parameters. The radiomics methodology will be tested based on images acquired within the randomized SAKK 16-00 study of multi-modality treatment for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Radiomics biomarkers of pre-treatment CT and FDG-PET images, or post induction therapy images and changes of radiomics parameters between these two time points will be analysed. Radiomics parameters will be correlated with available histo-pathological tumor characteristics, primary (event-free survival) and secondary (overall survival, response to induction therapy, failure pattern, pulmonary toxicity) study endpoints.It is the hypothesis, that radiomics analyses will enable us to build better and more accurate prognostic models than the ones currently based on the TNM system as well as predictive models for identification of patients, who might benefit from neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy instead of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, only.The radiomics methodology and the machine learning algorithms will be evaluated in cancer patients suffering from NSCLC, a disease with currently very poor prognosis. It is planned to evaluate radiomics and the machine learning algorithms in other cancer sites as well. Additionally, the application of radiomics and the machine learning algorithms are not restricted to Oncology but can maybe successfully used in other medical questions.

62    Professor Carrol Enitan    Ente Ospedaliero Cantonale    2016-10-01    2019-09-30    The ETS transcription factor ESE3/EHF as a regulator of prostate epithelial cell differentiation and stem cell properties    Cancer of the prostate is the most common cancer and a leading cause of cancer death in western countries. Mortality is mostly due to metastatic disease and presently there is great need to understand the factors governing the clinical evolution of prostate cancer and identify new therapeutic strategies. ETS transcription factors have emerged as important elements in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. About half of prostate tumors harbors chromosomal translocations involving ETS genes, the most frequent being the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion. However, the biological function of the endogenous ETS gene network and its relationship with translocated ETS in prostate tumorigenesis has been poorly investigated. ETS transcription factors are nodal points of critical signaling pathways controlling cell differentiation, proliferation and survival in many cells and tissues. In the human genome there are 27 distinct ETS factors that share the highly conserved ETS DNA binding domain. We have examined the expression of the ETS gene family in normal and prostate cancer tissue samples. In the course of this study, we identified endogenously expressed ETS factors that, in addition to the translocated ETS, could contribute to prostate tumorigenesis. Specifically, we found that the epithelial-specific ETS factor ESE3/EHF, which is normally expressed in prostate epithelial cells, was down-regulated in about 50% of prostate tumors. We have strong evidences supporting a tumor suppressor function of ESE3/EHF in prostate cancer. Data from our group support a direct role of ESE3/EHF in the maintenance of prostate epithelial cell differentiation and in restraining the cancer stem cell compartment. Knock-down of ESE3/EHF in immortalized human prostate epithelial cells resulted in the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and acquisition of stem-like properties. More recent data support a direct role of ESE3/EHF in controlling key genes and microRNAs involved in the expansion of the cancer stem cell compartment. Our data indicate that modulation of these target genes successfully reverses transformation and stemness. During the past few years we have characterized prostate tumors with loss of ESE3/EHF expression. We found that ESE3low tumors have distinctive molecular and biological characteristics, including enrichment of EMT and stem-like features. Reduced expression of ESE3/EHF has a negative prognostic impact significantly reducing overall survival in large cohorts of patients with primary prostate cancers suggesting that ESE3low tumors may represent a subgroup of more aggressive prostate tumors. Intriguingly, our preliminary data support the notion that ESE3low tumors have also alterations of the androgenic signaling network, may be resistant to androgen blockade and thus may require alternative therapeutic strategies. Collectively, our data support that ESE3/EHF constitutes in the normal prostate a barrier for prostate transformation and a brake for the induction of cells with stem-like properties. These data encourage further studies to understand the role of this transcription factor in prostate epithelial cell differentiation, cancer stem cells and transformation. Furthermore, our data encourage further characterization of the ESE3low tumors to develop novel diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic strategies for these aggressive tumors.Accordingly, the overall project has these specific aims: Specific Aim 1. Evaluation and functional characterization of the transcriptional network associated with cancer stem cells and its relationship with ESE3/EHF. Specific Aim 2. Evaluation of the crosstalk between ESE3/EHF and androgen signalling pathway.Specific Aim 3. Evaluation of the consequences of ESE3/EHF loss in newly generated ESE3KO mouse model. Together the studies proposed in this application will advance our understanding of the complex role of the ETS transcription factors in prostate cancer pathogenesis and will contribute to the development of precision medicine approaches for the treatment of prostate cancer.

66    Dr Rauch Marcus    Alpha Biomics Ltd    2019-02-15    2019-10-15    Harnessing the microbiome for precision medicine using advanced multi-omics analytics    Every day, millions of people in the UK and worldwide are taking medications that will not help them. This is bad for patients but also financially burdens healthcare systems like the NHS. Patients need &quot;precision medicine&quot; where individual patients are better matched with safe and effective therapies that work for them. The gut microbiome (the bacteria that live in our gut) has important influence over drug response. For some patients with serious disease, having the right microbiome when starting treatment can literally mean the difference between life and death. Yet, patients have no way to predict and/or change the way they respond to therapy. AlphaBiomics was founded in March 2018 by a team of experienced and dedicated scientific entrepreneurs to address inconsistent treatment response. The company's' focus is to develop microbiome-based precision medicine productsto improve treatment outcome with immunomodulatory drugs in serious autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and multiple sclerosis (MS). By uncovering which factors (biomarkers) such as individual bacteria or microbial functions within the gut microbiome communities influence drug efficacy and toxicity, AlphaBiomics can provide patients with two types of products: Predictive diagnostics: to predict whether or not a patient will respond to treatment based on the microbial signals measured just before treatment begins. Companion therapeutics: that improve the efficacy of the primary immunotherapy they are starting. Companion therapeutics accompany the primary drug and can take several forms including bacteria, bacterial genes and/or microbiome- or host- derived bioactive small molecules or proteins that restore appropriate functionality in non-responders While encouraging results have been obtained by academic laboratories, the methods used have not yet reached the rigour and sophistication needed to get actionable insights for patients. AlphaBiomics will use i4i Connect financial support to draw together expertise in artificial intelligence, statistics, and microbiome science to complete its analysis pipeline and achieve strong proof-of-concept for its operational pipeline. Moreover, it will enable AlphaBiomics to better understand patients' needs via focus groups and to conduct critical market research and basic health economic analyses important to strengthen AlphaBiomics business case for follow on investment. AlphaBiomics will disseminate its progress and research results by updating patient advocacy groups, and by publishing its results in peer-reviewed journals. i4i Connect funding will accelerate AlphaBiomics mission to deliver safe and, efficacious and cost-effective drug therapies to patients who need them.

MM is preceded by prevalent, asymptomatic stages that may evolve with variable frequency, not accurately captured by current clinical prognostic scores. Supported by preliminary data, my hypothesis is that the same heterogeneity is present early on the disease course, and identification of the biological determinants of evolution at this stage will allow better prediction of its evolutionary trajectory, if not its control. In this proposal I will therefore make a sharp change from conventional approaches and move to early stages of MM using unique retrospective sample cohorts and ambitious prospective sampling. To identify clonal MM cells in the elderly before a monoclonal gammopathy can be detected, I will collect bone marrow (BM) from hundreds of hip replacement specimens, and analyze archive peripheral blood samples of thousands of healthy individuals with years of annotated clinical follow-up. This will identify early genomic alterations that are permissive to disease initiation/evolution and may serve as biomarkers for clinical screening. Through innovative, integrated single-cell genotyping and phenotyping of hundreds of asymptomatic MMs, I will functionally dissect heterogeneity and characterize the BM microenvironment to look for determinants of disease progression. Correlation with clinical outcome and mini-invasive serial sampling of circulating cell-free DNA will identify candidate biological markers to better predict evolution. Last, aggressive modelling of candidate early lesions and modifier screens will offer a list of vulnerabilities that could be exploited for rationale therapies. These methodologies will deliver a paradigm for the use of molecularly-driven precision medicine in cancer.    European Research Council    Consolidator Grant    1998781.0EUR

70    Dr Sheaves Bryony    University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna    2016-09-01    2021-08-31    CDK6 in transcription - turning a foe in a friend    'Translational research aims at applying mechanistic understanding in the development of 'precision medicine', which depends on precise diagnostic tools and therapeutic approaches. Cancer therapy is experiencing a switch from non-specific, cytotoxic agents towards molecularly targeted and rationally designed compounds with the promise of greater efficacy and fewer side effects. The two cell-cycle kinases CDK4 and CDK6 normally facilitate cell-cycle progression but are abnormally activated in certain cancers. CDK6 is up-regulated in hematopoietic malignancies, where it is the predominant cell-cycle kinase. The importance of CDK4/6 for tumor development is underscored by the fact that the US FDA selected inhibitors of the kinase activity of CDK4/6 as 'breakthrough of the year 2013'. Our recent findings suggest that the effects of the inhibitors may be limited as CDK6 is not only involved in cell-cycle progression: ground-breaking research in my group and others has shown that CDK6 is involved in regulation of transcription in a kinase-independent manner thereby driving the proliferation of leukemic stem cells and tumor formation. We have now identified mutations in CDK6 that convert it from a tumor promoter into a tumor suppressor. This unexpected outcome is accompanied by a distinct transcriptional profile. Separating the tumor-promoting from the tumor suppressive functions may open a novel therapeutic avenue for drug development. We aim at understanding which domains and residues of CDK6 are involved in rewiring the transcriptional landscape to pave the way for sophisticated inhibitors. The idea of turning a cancer cell's own most potent weapon against itself is novel and would represent a new paradigm for drug design. Finally, the understanding of CDK6 functions in tumor promotion and maintenance will also result in better patient stratification and improved treatment decisions for a broad spectrum of cancer types.'

71    Dr. BONNEFOND Amélie    National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM)    2017-05-01    2022-04-30    Functional genomics of non-coding mutations in regulatory regions of four metabolic tissues, and their involvement into type 2 diabetes through large-scale sequencing    Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex systemic metabolic disorder which has developed into a global major health problem responsible for early morbidities and mortality. T2D is a multifactorial disease, resulting from progressive alteration of insulin secretion from beta cells in pancreatic islets, on a background of resistance to insulin action in various organs and tissues, including liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. T2D heritability is estimated around 40-70%. Genome-wide association studies identified more than 90 T2D-associated common variants, but altogether they explain less than 15% of T2D inheritance. Rare loss-of-function coding variants may contribute to T2D risk. Moreover, recent studies suggested the putative impact on T2D risk of functional non-coding variants within active enhancers of pancreatic islets; but tissue-specific regulatory regions have remained largely unexplored by genetic epidemiology studies. I intend to make progress in T2D genetic epidemiology and physiology by extending genetic investigation to frequent and rare mutations in non-coding regulatory regions on a whole-genome basis. In the Reg-Seq project, I propose the next-generation sequencing (NGS) of most relevant DNA regulatory sequences of four key metabolic tissues for T2D (pancreatic islets, liver, muscle and adipose tissue) in large well-phenotyped prospective populations (N=10,000 samples), followed by a replication in additional cohorts and by comprehensive functional experiments when genetic associations are identified. This project should lead to the identification of new functional genetic markers and pathways involved in T2D risk and development, and should help to stratify the T2D population for precision medicine, which is one of the major goals of the EU-Horizon 2020 programme. Further elucidation of the missing heritability should enable a major advance in the prediction of T2D risk, which is still very poor for a genuine clinical translation.

72    Dr. JAGODIC Maja    Karolinska Institutet    2019-06-01    2024-05-31    Targeting the epigenome: towards a better understanding of disease pathogenesis and novel therapeutic strategies in Multiple Sclerosis    Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a leading cause of unpredictable and incurable progressive disability in young adults. Although the exact cause remains unknown, this immune-mediated disease is likely triggered by environmental factors in genetically predisposed individuals. I propose that epigenetic mechanisms, which regulate gene expression without affecting the genetic code, mediate the processes that cause MS and that aberrant epigenetic states can be corrected, spearheading the development of alternative therapies. We will exploit the stable and reversible nature of epigenetic marks, in particular DNA methylation, to gain insights into the novel modifiable disease mechanisms by studying the target organ in a way that has not been possible before. This highly ambitious project comprises three synergistic facets formulated in specific aims to: (i) identify epigenetic states that characterize the pathogenesis of MS, (ii) prioritize functional epigenetic states using high-throughput epigenome-screens, and (iii) develop novel approaches for precision medicine based on correcting causal epigenetic states. Our unique MS biobank combined with cutting-edge methodologies to capture pathogenic cells and measure their functional states provides a rational starting point to identify MS targets. I will complement this approach with studies of the functional impact of MS targets using innovative in vitro screens, with the added value of unbiased discovery of robust regulators of specific MS pathways. Finally, my laboratory has extensive experience with animal models of MS and I will utilize these powerful systems to dissect molecular mechanisms of MS targets and test the therapeutic potential of targeted epigenome editing in vivo. Our findings will set the stage for a paradigm-shift in studying and treating chronic inflammatory diseases based on preventing and modulating aggressive immune responses by inducing self-sustained reversal of aberrant epigenetic states.

73    Dr Bendayan Rebecca    King´s College London    2019-09-12    2019-10-12    Longitudinal Profiling Techniques: Applications to immune and cognitive ageing    Our aim is to set up and develop a new collaboration to investigate the association between immune ageing with cognitive ageing in longitudinal settings applying novel analytical and computational strategies. Dr. Shen-Orr is a leading expert in high resolution longitudinal profiling with applications in immune ageing. Dr. Bendayan is an expert in longitudinal data analysis techniques with applications in cognitive ageing. The combinations of their areas of expertise and research interests could provide new ways of understanding changes in these areas in ageing population. In this visit, we aim to identify opportunities of translation of the combination of both approaches to precision medicine and design a roadmap for potential collaborative projects. On one side, Shen-Orr & Furman (2013) highlighted that variability in immune phenotypes increases with age which is likely to be associated to an individual's life course health trajectories; and they proposed to consider the changes in the variance of immunological parameters as different immune trajectories of ageing. On the other side, Bendayan has also found that there is an increase in variability in cognitive phenotypes with age (e.g., Bendayan et al., 2018; Davis, Bendayan et al, 2017) which might be associated to other health conditions which in turn are known to be linked to the immunological markers (e.g., Miller & Raison, 2016). Given this context, we propose to explore the association between immune and cognitive markers in older populations, first in data collected for research purposes to which we have already access and then tailor this approach to its potential application to electronic health records. Following, Shen-Orr & Furman (2013) we hypothesize that older individuals with lower variance in immunological parameters will show a cognitive performance above average for their age and in this groups of individuals we will find common protective factors in their life course associated. In addition, both researchers are interested in improving techniques for longitudinal analysis and while they share applications there is a great opportunity to share expertise from statistical and highly computational backgrounds.

82    Dr. FINOTELLO Francesca    Medical University of Innsbruck    2018-02-01    2021-01-31    The tumor-immune interface of human lung cancer    Recent breakthroughs in tumor immunology and immunotherapy have set the immune system at the core of the battle against cancer. Immunotherapies with checkpoint blockers have shown remarkable clinical effects and have been already approved for the treatment of different advanced cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, durable responses are obtained only in a fraction of patients suggesting the presence of different mechanisms of immune evasion and underlining the need for biomarkers to monitor and predict the response to cancer immunotherapy. We advocate that the biomarkers proposed so far fail to predict the response to immunotherapy because they do not recapitulate the immune contexture (i.e. the type, density, location, and functional orientation of tumor-infiltrating immune cells) and the mechanisms of immune escape. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies can provide the information necessary to portray the molecular landscape of the tumor and its immune contexture: the tumor-immune interface. However, as of today, there are no methods available to reconstruct the tumor-immune interface from NGS data and there is an urgent need to develop bioinformatics tools and pipelines. This project aims at the development of a computational pipeline for the reconstruction of a high-resolution map of the tumor-immune interface in NSCLC. The pipeline will use whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data to extract the features describing the immune contexture and the mutational status of NSCLC tumors. In particular, we will develop a novel deconvolution algorithm for the quantification of immune cells from lung tumor RNA-seq data. Within this project, we will use ten NSCLC tumors to generate single-cell RNA-seq data to develop the deconvolution method, plus bulk RNA-seq and digital pathology images for its validation. The computational pipeline will be applied to WES and RNA-seq data from fifty NSCLC patients treated with checkpoint blockers to unravel the mechanisms of immune evasion that hamper the efficacy of immunotherapy. The computational pipeline developed by this project will be a valuable resource for precision medicine, whereas the insights derived from the reconstruction of the tumor-immune interface in NSCLC might lay the foundations for future mechanistic studies on resistance to therapy and for the rational design of combination therapies for a cancer type that has a high incidence and mortality worldwide.

Immunotherapies with checkpoint blockers have shown remarkable clinical effects and have been already approved for the treatment of different advanced cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, durable responses are obtained only in a fraction of patients suggesting the presence of different mechanisms of immune evasion and underlining the need for biomarkers to monitor and predict the response to cancer immunotherapy. We advocate that the biomarkers proposed so far fail to predict the response to immunotherapy because they do not recapitulate the immune contexture (i.e. the type, density, location, and functional orientation of tumor-infiltrating immune cells) and the mechanisms of immune escape.

TBI is a major challenge for healthcare providers and poses an enormous economic burden. For decades, TBI has been characterized by severity of symptoms for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. However, this classification system is limited since it does not allow to predict long-term outcome after TBI. This state of affairs thus hinders the advancement of TBI research and the development of therapies. The field is thus in dire need of a novel understanding and classification of the individual’s response to brain injury and, most importantly, a fresh perspective on potential targets for effective treatment and prevention of long-term impairment. My main hypothesis is that brain injury leads to a neurosteroid response with inter-individual variability and that this response is associated with the trajectory of recovery. I further hypothesize, that the most vulnerable patient cohorts, such as adolescent girls, show distinct patterns of neurosteroid response associated with an increased risk for persistent symptoms. NEUROPRECISE proposes a longitudinal cohort study 1) to characterize neurosteroid response with respect to age and sex in children and adolescents with TBI, 2) to evaluate the association of the neuroimaging derived individual injury profile with neurosteroid response, and 3) to explore individual differences in neurosteroid response as a potential target for acute therapy and prevention of chronic symptoms with respect to age and sex in a rodent model. NEUROPRECISE will overcome a critical barrier towards the treatment of TBI by establishing a novel, biological-driven way to stratify TBI patients based on inter-individual differences in the response to TBI. By exploring the individual neurosteroid response as potential therapeutic target, NEUROPRECISE will bring the power of precision medicine to neurotrauma research.

The number of liver cancer-related deaths in Europe in 2018 amounted to 77 375, and this number is expected to keep rising, reaching an estimated number of more than 100 000 deaths in 2040 (IARC). Major causes include the hepatitis B and C viruses, alcoholism, Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis. All of these medical conditions trigger liver fibrosis by damaging the liver and are closely associated with the development of HCC. As a matter of fact, more than 80% of HCC develop in fibrotic or cirrhotic livers. Early stages of liver cancer do not usually produce symptoms, and many challenges are associated with the screening of HCC, leading to its late diagnosis. The absence of effective drug treatment for HCC makes its resection the first curative option with most of the patients experiencing HCC recurrence within 5 years. All these factors contribute to the poor prognosis of the HCC patients. Sorafenib is the only currently approved systemic therapy for advanced HCC in the EU, only prolonging survival by an average of 3 months, the treatment often leads to drug resistance. Indeed, intra-tumor heterogeneity strongly constrains the therapeutic benefit of precision medicine and triggers drug-resistant sub-population of cells. Consequently, persistent treatment of drug-resistant tumor cells may accelerate tumor progression, suggesting that inappropriate and continual use of a compound on drug-resistant cancer cells is not recommended. Thus, there is an urgent unmet medical need to identify and to validate the therapeutic efficacy of new valuable molecules – i.e. targeting the existing drug-resistant cell populations -that could be used in monotherapy or in combination therapy with FDA-approved drugs to improve HCC treatment responses.

89    Dr Bendayan Rebecca    King´s College London    2019-09-12    2019-10-12    Longitudinal Profiling Techniques: Applications to immune and cognitive ageing    Our aim is to set up and develop a new collaboration to investigate the association between immune ageing with cognitive ageing in longitudinal settings applying novel analytical and computational strategies. Dr. Shen-Orr is a leading expert in high resolution longitudinal profiling with applications in immune ageing. Dr. Bendayan is an expert in longitudinal data analysis techniques with applications in cognitive ageing. The combinations of their areas of expertise and research interests could provide new ways of understanding changes in these areas in ageing population. In this visit, we aim to identify opportunities of translation of the combination of both approaches to precision medicine and design a roadmap for potential collaborative projects. On one side, Shen-Orr & Furman (2013) highlighted that variability in immune phenotypes increases with age which is likely to be associated to an individual's life course health trajectories; and they proposed to consider the changes in the variance of immunological parameters as different immune trajectories of ageing. On the other side, Bendayan has also found that there is an increase in variability in cognitive phenotypes with age (e.g., Bendayan et al., 2018; Davis, Bendayan et al, 2017) which might be associated to other health conditions which in turn are known to be linked to the immunological markers (e.g., Miller & Raison, 2016). Given this context, we propose to explore the association between immune and cognitive markers in older populations, first in data collected for research purposes to which we have already access and then tailor this approach to its potential application to electronic health records. Following, Shen-Orr & Furman (2013) we hypothesize that older individuals with lower variance in immunological parameters will show a cognitive performance above average for their age and in this groups of individuals we will find common protective factors in their life course associated. In addition, both researchers are interested in improving techniques for longitudinal analysis and while they share applications there is a great opportunity to share expertise from statistical and highly computational backgrounds.

Realistic mechanistic models are needed to understand and limit heterogeneity in drug responses. Consequently, novel approaches are required that explicitly account for individual variations in response to environmental influences, in addition to genetic variation. The human gut microbiota metabolizes drugs and is modulated by diet, and it exhibits significant variation among individuals. However, the influence of the gut microbiota on drug failure or drug side effects is under-researched. In this study, I will combine whole-body, genome-scale molecular resolution modeling of human metabolism and human gut microbial metabolism, which represents a network of genes, proteins, and biochemical reactions, with physiological, clinically relevant modeling of drug responses. I will perform two pilot studies on human subjects to illustrate that this innovative, versatile computational modeling framework can be used to stratify patients prior to drug prescription and to optimize drug bioavailability through personalized dietary intervention. With these studies, BugTheDrug will advance mechanistic understanding of drug-microbiota-diet interactions and their contribution to individual drug responses. I will perform the first integration of cutting-edge approaches and novel insights from four distinct research areas: systems biology, quantitative systems pharmacology, microbiology, and nutrition. BugTheDrug conceptually and technologically addresses the demand for novel approaches to the study of individual variability, thereby providing breakthrough support for progress in precision medicine.

By embedding ratiometric fluorescent particle-based sensors within 3D scaffolds, the changes in target analyte concentrations can be monitored and used to study the interactions between tumour cells and stromal cells in 3D tumoroids/scaffolds and to monitor response of the cells to drug treatments. I first demonstrated successful fabrication of barcoded capsules for multiplex sensing of H+, K+, and Na+ ions. Next, I demonstrated the use of pH-sensing capsules as valid real time optical reporter tools to sense and monitor intracellular acidification in living cells. Thus, I can fabricate capsule sensors for investigating the role of key analytes that are involved in regulation of crucial physiological mechanisms. In addition, I successfully integrated pH-sensing capsules within 3D nanofibrous matrices and demonstrated their operation under pH switches. INTERCELLMED will engineer 3D scaffolds that do not only sense extracellular pH but are also able to sense K+ and O2 changes. To this aim, a novel set of anisotropic analyte-sensitive ratiometric capsules will be developed and applied for generating robust and flexible capsules-embedded sensing scaffolds. To validate the functions of the 3D sensing platform, cocoltures of tumour cells and stromal cells will be grown and their interaction and response to drug treatments will be studied by mapping the K+/H+/O2 gradients in and around the cell aggregates. Finally, the 3D sensing platform will be adapted for growing tumour tissue-derived cells that will be tested ex-vivo with anticancer dugs. Specific mathematical models of cellular interactions will be developed to represent the biological processes occurring within the 3D sensing platform.

93    Dr Figueroa Jonine    University of Basel    2017-07-01    2020-12-31    Advancing SMart solutions and eliminating barriers for the Acquisition, Analysis, and Sharing of Health data in Switzerland [SMAASH]    Valid and comparable data, including outcome, diagnosis, treatment, risk factors etc., are an important means to reduce over- and underuse of resources in a smarter health care system. Acquisition, analysis, and sharing of such data is a priority on the agenda of 2016 and beyond. In the US, a number of initiatives are taking place to coordinate and harmonize high quality collection and analysis of health data to enable precision medicine and to rationalize treatment of chronic diseases. The aim is to obtain comprehensive comparative data for evidence-based public health and health care. In order to advance smarter medicine, in the US a number of data collection initiatives exist where data from ambulatory or inpatient hospital care is collected routinely and helps to identify better measures and to answer critical questions in the clinical research agenda. Examples are the outpatient clinical registry called “Guideline Advantage (TGA)”, or the National Hospital Care Survey NHCS and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, NHAMCS. To improve evidence-based, smart health care, data from various hospitals, ambulatory care providers, researchers and insurance companies should be combined. Thus, the concept that collection and analysis of health data can remain the task of “a single investigator in a single laboratory for a single purpose” needs to be abandoned. Integrating such local and national data into a coherent network of resources and infrastructure that allows for the efficient and ethical sharing of data, as recommended by the NIH, is urgently needed in Switzerland. At present, data collecting entities tend to prefer using their own clinical or other indicators for success and outcome which is a clear weakness for the Swiss health care system. Efforts are urgently needed to improve (i.) standardization and comparability of data and indicators, (ii.) availability of data from different sources including insurance companies, (iii.) increased veracity and (iv.) completeness of data, comprising the routine collection of valid health and quality indicators. Within and across countries, collaborative acquisition and analysis of comparable health data (and biological samples) is hampered by a number of barriers. In comparison to other European countries and the US, Switzerland is lagging behind. While some barriers, such as the cantonal structure, are evident, others are yet unknown and need urgently to be assessed in more detail, in order to enable smarter health care in Switzerland. The present project will build on previous experience of the two main applicants. BE has worked on barriers to sharing concerning genetic databanks and TP is an expert in health care quality control and evaluation. The aim of this project is to provide urgently needed knowledge on how to overcome barriers to implement high quality, comparable health data collection in Switzerland. The study is at the same time an intervention towards the facilitation of smart data collection as it will not only obtain knowledge, but make key stakeholders and decision makers aware of the need for harmonized good quality data and involve them actively in the search for solutions to overcome barriers.Objectives, methods and study parts are the following:i.Identify success mechanisms, barriers and needs in Switzerland: using a literature search and theoretical analysis, we will describe factors that facilitated past success stories of harmonized health data collection in Switzerland (e.g. HIV-cohort, SAPALDIA, CHUV-biobank), analyse what is known about barriers, and identify needs in Switzerland, e.g. types of needed data, including harmonised tools and indicators used abroad and susceptible to be useful in Switzerland. This includes an assessment of legal and ethical barriers.ii.Explore success factors in other countries: semi-structured interviews will be conducted with approximately 15-25 decision makers and experts in institutions that developed efficient data collection tools in other countries, including those with health care systems comparable to Switzerland. iii.Understand decision makers and key stakeholders’ attitudes and knowledge to identify barriers and propose concrete solutions via a Delphi process: semi-structured interviews will be carried out with 20-30 hospital directors, hospital data managers, insurance company representatives and other stakeholders involved in or influencing collection of relevant data in Switzerland and 20-30 health data researchers and Swiss data experts. The Delphi approach will be concluded using a questionnaire and workshops that extend into part iv.iv.Inform and disseminate findings: this objective is already integrated in part iii. as experts and stakeholders will not only be asked about their experience and attitudes, but also informed about needs and facilitators identified in parts i. and ii. Study results will also be disseminated through the usual scientific vectors (conferences, publications etc.).v.Based on expert consensus, produce concrete, detailed and practically useful recommendations to inform policy makers how to reduce barriers and further good quality health data collection in Switzerland.

94    Dr Figueroa Jonine    University of Lausanne    2017-09-01    2020-08-31    Translational hyperpolarized metabolic imaging of the heart for the quantification of metabolic changes in chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity    Cancer treatment containing doxorubicin can have irreversible side effects that lead to heart failure. Substantial evidence suggests that early-onset metabolic changes precede cardiac dysfunction, and that improving mitochondrial activity may better protect the heart against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (DC). Several food supplements are suspected to boost mitochondrial metabolic activity, but it is unknown whether they avert the chemotherapy-induced metabolic changes. Knowledge of such changes could lead to a better understanding of DC that might improve cancer treatment and outcome. However, no means have been available to detect such metabolic changes in vivo.Recently, hyperpolarized (HP) magnetic resonance (MR) technology demonstrated the measurement of real-time metabolic activity in vivo after the injection of HP 13C labeled metabolites. Using HP metabolic imaging, early onset metabolic changes were visualized in a diseased large animal model, and the technology was translated to image prostate cancer in patients in 2013. A significant hurdle in the clinical translation of HP MR is the presence of toxic free radicals that necessitates a time-consuming filtration process. However, exciting recent findings showed that HP metabolic imaging of pure, radical-free metabolite solutions is possible.In this proposal, the researcher will develop novel “radical-free” HP MR technology for metabolic imaging in vivo using advanced image reconstruction methods. She will establish a link between in vivo metabolic changes and the level of DC, and investigate whether this damage can be prevented with novel food supplements. HP MR enables the real-time measurement of biochemical processes, which has never been possible before. If heart failure progression in DC can be monitored with HP MR, and averted, this would improve the understanding of cardiotoxic mechanisms and support the design of precision medicine through strategies aimed at minimizing cardiotoxicity, knowledge that can be translated to patients or even allow for individualized therapy. The proposed study is novel because the hyperpolarization of metabolites without adding radicals is revolutionary, and the application of CS to metabolic imaging of the heart is innovative. This will be the first study to develop radical-free HP metabolic imaging for the heart, and the first to identify and quantify the in vivo metabolic biomarkers associated with DC. Furthermore we will establish the cardioprotective effect of NR.    Swiss National Science Foundation    Ambizione    597056.0CHF
95    Dr Figueroa Jonine    Genome Biology Unit European Molecular Biology Institute EMBL    2018-02-01    2019-07-31    Dissecting genetic interactions underlying complex traits via systematic genome editing    A major challenge for understanding phenotypic diversity and enabling precision medicine is improving our currently very limited ability to predict phenotypic outcomes based on genome sequence and environmental context. Our lack of knowledge on the functional consequences of the vast majority of genetic variation is one of the fundamental problems impeding such endeavors. While naturally occurring variants have the most relevance for explaining phenotypic diversity, systematic genome perturbations have primarily been focused on large-effect alleles, such as gene deletions. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping have addressed the role of natural variation in conditioning complex traits, but these approaches are limited by the haplotypes present in the population and are poorly equipped to detect interactions between loci - situations where the effect of one variant is masked or enhanced by another variant. It has become clear that a comprehensive view of genetic variation and its role in shaping phenotypes requires systematic perturbation of each variant in different genetic and environmental contexts. Recent advances in genome engineering now make such an approach possible. Here I propose to systematically engineer and phenotype naturally occurring single nucleotide variants and small insertion-deletion polymorphisms in three distinct Saccharomyces cerevisiae backgrounds. The strains will be constructed by a high-throughput CRISPR approach that allows creation of thousands of barcoded and sequence-verified variant strains simultaneously. I will profile strain pools in multiple environments, identifying those variants that modulate fitness in a given environment and genetic background by next-generation sequencing of genomically integrated DNA barcodes. To map pairwise and higher-order interactions I will then directly engineer variant combinations and assay their impact on cellular processes and fitness. The work in this proposal will be an important contribution towards understanding the phenotypic landscape governed by natural variants and their interaction with each other and the environment. Due to the conservation of fundamental cellular processes, the here identified principles underlying allelic interactions will allow valuable insights into the organizing principles of cellular systems.

96    Dr Figueroa Jonine    University of Zurich    2017-02-01    2019-01-31    Digital Cancer Biobank - zBioLink    The recent dramatic success of immune checkpoint inhibitors has been a long awaited revolution in cancer treatment. Combined with the broad adoption of next-generation-sequencing (NGS) and functional drug screening techniques, the face of biomedical research is changing rapidly. In the future, routine molecular analysis and in vitro pharmacological testing will support patient-tailored therapies. But our understanding of how particular features in high-dimensional datasets contribute to or predict therapeutic response is still in its infancy. Thus, the current proposal is intended to link various biobanks at the University Hospital Zürich (USZ) to follow-up on an initial study by the group of Prof. Mitch Levesque (co-leader of this proposal) that identified a significant predictive biomarker of response to both currently available immune checkpoint inhibitors in melanoma (anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1).Clinical cancer specimens are unique and finite. They are also a critical foundation for precision medicine (PM). In general, clinical specimens such as blood, tissue or cell samples are annotated and stored in biospecimen banks (biobanks) that are typically associated with and maintained by a specific clinical center. In this interdisciplinary BioLink project, we propose to generate a digital biobank of melanoma specimens and living cells by linking the resources of at least two departments (Dept. of Dermatology & Pathology, and potentially Oncology and Hematology), where the genomic and pharmacological information is recorded and presented in searchable, digital files that are stored with the clinical metadata in a database. This pioneering project builds on a worldwide unique collection of tissue specimens and data acquisition techniques present in Zürich. It has the potential to transform PM by making data that represents the quantitative molecular and functional makeup of clinical samples accessible for research. This project will address the urgent clinical need of establishing a better stratification of metastatic melanoma patients for the most efficacious therapy. This will be based on the methods developed by the group of Prof. Levesque and recently presented at ASCO 2016. But in order to validate and expand their findings, it is necessary to gather the relevant data and samples from the USZ in three well-defined steps. The first is to establish the laboratory information system SLims (Genohm SA, Lausanne) by linking two established physical tissue and cell biobanks at the University Hospital Zürich (Dept. of Pathology and Dermatology), the second is to establish database capabilities, data analytics, and visualization tools (cBioPortal, The Hyve, Cambridge, USA) to support in silico research with the available genomic and clinical/phenotypic metadata, and the third is to define personalized, rationally chosen treatment regimens for each individual melanoma patient to prolong life after ex vivo pharmacologic testing of melanoma cells (precision medicine).We will meet these important challenges through the development and the implementation of a new, integrated strategy that is focused on the combined analysis of immune signatures and genetics as well as all available clinical parameters. Our two-year project will be initiated and made feasible by focusing on malignant melanoma and builds on the results and advances achieved by the project team. In the past, the applicants have successfully established facilities to convert physical specimens into digital files representing their genomic states. A pilot program of a carefully selected set of 150 specimens will be carried out, comparing features of tumors and matching living cells. Specifically, the unique technical capabilities and resources the project team will bring to bear on melanoma include 1) unique, annotated clinical tissue and cell resources including the two largest cancer tissue and cell biobanks in Switzerland, 2) technologies to generate genetic barcodes and drug response data of melanoma samples in a high-throughput manner, 3) a novel framework (Oracle Translational Research Center Platform) for linking metadata in the clinic, and 4) (bio-) informatics tools to define and visualize the networks perturbed in melanoma. Associated challenges will be solved by the development of a digital biobank application, using the cBioPortal software (The Hyve, Cambridge) that visualizes different biobanking initiatives. Another result and unique feature of the project will be the prospective generation of a digital biobank sui generis for all types of disease, called zBioLink. Besides conventional tissue and cell samples, sequencing results will be systematically collected and integrated with clinical outcome information and pharmacological in vitro data. The project will extend the current histopathological and genetic characterization of cancer tissue to the level of functional drug response data. In addition, the zBioLink project will establish a general framework for bringing basic research discoveries to the clinics for patients’ benefit and provide an environment for clinical and basic scientists to collaborate efficiently. The project team has already implemented a tumor-board in molecular-oncology and immuno-oncology at the University Hospital Zürich, where selected patients from the pilot study with metastatic disease can be discussed. Access to data will be provided by the Research Data Service Center, USZ. The project will democratize precision medicine research by linking these efforts and presenting the data of tissues and living cells in a graphical user interface (zBioLink). Linked biobank databases of this scale will facilitate the realization of systems medicine as a milestone on the way to an effective PM program that enables the identification of predictive biomarkers and potential drug targets across large cohorts of cancer patients. We anticipate that the project will be completed within two years. Alignment with national initiatives (Swiss Biobanking Platform, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics) is intended to allow for collaborations and harmonization of standards across Switzerland.

In contrast to conventional radiological image analysis, this methodology is a) objective and observer-independent and b) allows for a comprehensive description of all available information within medical images. Radiomics is therefore considered as a potential addition to the efforts currently undertaken in the field of precision medicine: to achieve a comprehensive analysis of the cancer phenotype in order to adjust the treatment to the patient-individual cancer characteristics.The aim of this project is to establish and to use comprehensive radiomics analyses in CT and FDG-PET images for outcome modelling. Prior to all image analyses, the radiomics algorithms will be evaluated regarding their robustness against non-standardized image acquisition and image reconstruction parameters. In addition, a model for quantification of loco-regional tumor spread will be established and its prognostic and predictive value will be compared to the conventional staging system. Machine learning algorithms will be established to correlate the large amount of radiomics biomarkers with clinical outcome parameters. The radiomics methodology will be tested based on images acquired within the randomized SAKK 16-00 study of multi-modality treatment for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Radiomics biomarkers of pre-treatment CT and FDG-PET images, or post induction therapy images and changes of radiomics parameters between these two time points will be analysed. Radiomics parameters will be correlated with available histo-pathological tumor characteristics, primary (event-free survival) and secondary (overall survival, response to induction therapy, failure pattern, pulmonary toxicity) study endpoints.It is the hypothesis, that radiomics analyses will enable us to build better and more accurate prognostic models than the ones currently based on the TNM system as well as predictive models for identification of patients, who might benefit from neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy instead of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, only.The radiomics methodology and the machine learning algorithms will be evaluated in cancer patients suffering from NSCLC, a disease with currently very poor prognosis. It is planned to evaluate radiomics and the machine learning algorithms in other cancer sites as well. Additionally, the application of radiomics and the machine learning algorithms are not restricted to Oncology but can maybe successfully used in other medical questions.

It follows that a number of data types are required to describe these factors; one-dimensional viewpoints – even omic datasets – are one-dimensional oversimplifications of extraordinarily complex multi-cellular systems. To power precision medicine, we must build a multi-dimensional picture, by integrating data from multiple viewpoints from the single-cell level upwards. Our overarching aim is to develop a step change in research capability towards precision medicine at the University of Southampton. We request funding for a microfluidic engineer, a systems biologist, to promote collaboration between mathematical, computational, engineering, biology and medical specialisms in a new interdisciplinary laboratory. We request equipment to develop new quantal microfluidic processes to increase information depth and resolution down to the single cell level, novel analytical methods will then model the complexity of human disease. This investment will produce new technology and methods to capture unique cross-cutting datasets in disease systems, and new multi-dimensional analytical strategies in molecular systems biology. It will not only uncover the spatiotemporal architecture of development in single cells and cell populations; it will promote an imaginative, systems-biological mind-set, and a common vocabulary of research and enquiry in microfluidics, data science, and medical research across rare, infectious, acquired and non-communicable disease.

102    Dr Esteller Badosa Manel    Ente Ospedaliero Cantonale    2016-10-01    2019-09-30    The ETS transcription factor ESE3/EHF as a regulator of prostate epithelial cell differentiation and stem cell properties    Cancer of the prostate is the most common cancer and a leading cause of cancer death in western countries. Mortality is mostly due to metastatic disease and presently there is great need to understand the factors governing the clinical evolution of prostate cancer and identify new therapeutic strategies. ETS transcription factors have emerged as important elements in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. About half of prostate tumors harbors chromosomal translocations involving ETS genes, the most frequent being the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion. However, the biological function of the endogenous ETS gene network and its relationship with translocated ETS in prostate tumorigenesis has been poorly investigated. ETS transcription factors are nodal points of critical signaling pathways controlling cell differentiation, proliferation and survival in many cells and tissues. In the human genome there are 27 distinct ETS factors that share the highly conserved ETS DNA binding domain. We have examined the expression of the ETS gene family in normal and prostate cancer tissue samples. In the course of this study, we identified endogenously expressed ETS factors that, in addition to the translocated ETS, could contribute to prostate tumorigenesis. Specifically, we found that the epithelial-specific ETS factor ESE3/EHF, which is normally expressed in prostate epithelial cells, was down-regulated in about 50% of prostate tumors. We have strong evidences supporting a tumor suppressor function of ESE3/EHF in prostate cancer. Data from our group support a direct role of ESE3/EHF in the maintenance of prostate epithelial cell differentiation and in restraining the cancer stem cell compartment. Knock-down of ESE3/EHF in immortalized human prostate epithelial cells resulted in the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and acquisition of stem-like properties. More recent data support a direct role of ESE3/EHF in controlling key genes and microRNAs involved in the expansion of the cancer stem cell compartment. Our data indicate that modulation of these target genes successfully reverses transformation and stemness. During the past few years we have characterized prostate tumors with loss of ESE3/EHF expression. We found that ESE3low tumors have distinctive molecular and biological characteristics, including enrichment of EMT and stem-like features. Reduced expression of ESE3/EHF has a negative prognostic impact significantly reducing overall survival in large cohorts of patients with primary prostate cancers suggesting that ESE3low tumors may represent a subgroup of more aggressive prostate tumors. Intriguingly, our preliminary data support the notion that ESE3low tumors have also alterations of the androgenic signaling network, may be resistant to androgen blockade and thus may require alternative therapeutic strategies. Collectively, our data support that ESE3/EHF constitutes in the normal prostate a barrier for prostate transformation and a brake for the induction of cells with stem-like properties. These data encourage further studies to understand the role of this transcription factor in prostate epithelial cell differentiation, cancer stem cells and transformation. Furthermore, our data encourage further characterization of the ESE3low tumors to develop novel diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic strategies for these aggressive tumors.Accordingly, the overall project has these specific aims: Specific Aim 1. Evaluation and functional characterization of the transcriptional network associated with cancer stem cells and its relationship with ESE3/EHF. Specific Aim 2. Evaluation of the crosstalk between ESE3/EHF and androgen signalling pathway.Specific Aim 3. Evaluation of the consequences of ESE3/EHF loss in newly generated ESE3KO mouse model. Together the studies proposed in this application will advance our understanding of the complex role of the ETS transcription factors in prostate cancer pathogenesis and will contribute to the development of precision medicine approaches for the treatment of prostate cancer.

103    Dr Esteller Badosa Manel    University of Zurich    2017-11-01    2017-12-31    Intestinal Reg3 lectins protect against bacterial translocation and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis    Background/Objective: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) will become the leading indication for liver transplantation in the near future. NASH is associated with obesity and intestinal dysbiosis, i.e., a change in the microbiota linked to disease, and translocation of bacterial products. Thus, the intestinal barrier has an important role in keeping bacteria at a distance to the host. Regenerating islet-derived protein (Reg) 3 lectins are antimicrobial molecules that are secreted by intestinal epithelial cells and Paneth cells as part of the innate immunity, and maintain sterility of the inner mucus layer. Reg3ß and Reg3? are almost exclusively expressed in the small intestine, but not in the liver or immune cells. Reg3 lectins are regulated by interleukin (IL)-22, which is mainly released by intestinal innate lymphoid cells (ILC3). The absence of Reg3 lectins promotes translocation of viable bacteria and alcoholic liver disease. In NASH, this interrelation has not yet been investigated. Hypotheses: Fast-food diet reduces expression of Reg3 lectins in the small intestine of mice by lower IL-22 expression. This promotes translocation of viable bacteria and hepatic features of NASH. Intestinal overexpression of Reg3? will prevent NASH. Humans with NASH are thought to have lower intestinal Reg3 expression than patients with NAFLD or normal weight controls. The proposed study will investigate the role of Reg3ß and ? on the pathogenesis of NASH. Molecular mechanisms were investigated in mouse models during an advanced postdoc mobility fellowship at the University of California San Diego. To test the relevance of Reg3 lectins in humans is part of a return phase fellowship in Switzerland. In patients with NASH and NAFLD the expression pattern of intestinal lectins along the small intestine will be investigated. Future directions/Outlook: Reg3 lectins can be regarded as endogenous antibiotics. If the project reveals that Reg3 expression is reduced in NASH, and this correlates to increased hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis, this would add significantly to the importance of the gut-liver axis. Moreover, strategies that aim at inducing IL-22/Reg3 lectins might become an integral part of precision medicine in liver disease.

114    Ms. Elo-Uhlgren Laura Linnea Maria    University of Turku    2016-06-01    2021-05-31    From longitudinal proteomics to dynamic individualized diagnostics    Longitudinal omics data hold great promise to improve biomarker detection and enable dynamic individualized predictions. Recent technological advances have made proteomics an increasingly attractive option but clinical longitudinal proteomic datasets are still rare and computational tools for their analysis underdeveloped. The objective of this proposal is to create a roadmap to detect clinically feasible protein markers using longitudinal data and effective computational tools. A biomedical focus is on early detection of Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Specific objectives are: 1) Novel biomarker detector using longitudinal data. DynaOmics introduces novel types of multi-level dynamic markers that are undetectable in conventional single-time cross-sectional studies (e.g. within-individual changes in abundance or associations), develops optimization methods for their robust and reproducible detection within and across individuals, and validates their utility in well-defined samples. 2) Individualized disease risk prediction dynamically. DynaOmics develops dynamic individualized predictive models using the multi-level longitudinal proteome features and novel statistical and machine learning methods that have previously not been used in this context, including joint models of longitudinal and time-to-event data, and one-class classification type techniques. 3) Dynamic prediction of T1D. DynaOmics builds a predictive model of dynamic T1D risk to assist early detection of the disease, which is crucial for developing future therapeutic and preventive strategies. T1D typically involves a relatively long symptom-free period before clinical diagnosis but current tools to predict early T1D risk have restricted power. The objectives involve innovative and unconventional approaches and address major unmet challenges in the field, having high potential to open new avenues for diagnosis and treatment of complex diseases and fundamentally novel insights towards precision medicine.

115    Dr Kaforou Myrsini    Imperial College London    2017-07-01    2021-07-01    Understanding and diagnosing infectious diseases using multi-level 'omics data    Infectious diseases are amongst the most complex multifactorial diseases, as they depend on dynamic interactions between the host and the pathogen. The development of high-throughput, low-cost technologies for studying the human and pathogen genomes, along with the epigenome, transcriptome and proteome have resulted in an exponential growth in available data. The current standard analytical approaches rely on single-level analyses of these datasets. However, complex systems, such as the host-pathogen interaction within an individual patient, can only be understood thoroughly if considered as a whole. I aim to integrate and then explore the complex genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic and clinical data of unique cohorts of infectious disease patients using advanced bioinformatics techniques. I will identify the host response that is common across different diseases, as well as the response that is unique to each disease, while unravelling relationships between the different data layers. The integrative analysis will lead to a better understanding of the key biological processes involved in the host response to infection, to the discovery of robust biomarkers, as well as disease subtypes. The results will be crucial for the identification of patient-specific interventions, and thus providing a stepping stone for bringing precision medicine closer to clinical practice.

117    Univ.Prof. Dr. SLAK RUPNIK Marjan    Medical University of Vienna    2019-08-01    2022-07-31    Beta-cells in diet-induced diabetes and remission    Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has long been considered as a chronic irreversible disease. Both insulin resistance in key target organs and beta cell dysfunction, the two key factors driving the disease, are thought to get progressively worse and patients with T2DM require sequential addition of therapies. Despite the therapy, cardiovascular, renal and other severe complications are common, and therefore represent an immense individual and public health cost. This is particularly true in Austria, where the number of T2DM diagnoses has almost tripled since the turn of the last century and the direct cost of treatment is relatively high. Recent studies have convincingly demonstrated that 4 out of 5 short-term diabetic patients can re-establish normoglycaemia with diet intervention. It remains enigmatic whether insulin sensitivity in key target organs or beta function has to be recovered to achieve remission. Our preliminary results support the idea that irreversible beta cell injury related to gluco- or lipotoxicity could be a key factor determining the responsiveness to the diet. The proposed project aims to use and further validate western-diet (WD)-induced mouse model of T2DM in both sexes, as well human islets, to explore the mechanism governing beta cell injury and its reversibility using acute pancreas slice approach in combination with electro-, optophysiological, as well as advanced computational and statistical methods. We will test the hypothesis that WD-induced T2DM in a mouse model primarily affects the function of the beta cells populations in islets of Langerhans. A battery of state-of-the art functional tests will enable us to discover the primary cellular pathway(s) of the beta cells injury, being nutrient sensing, excitation, Ca2+ dynamics, cell-to-cell communication or molecular events in the late steps of the insulin exocytosis process. The mouse experiments are planned in two waves that would enable us to adjust the dietary interventions period and expand the testing of diet-induced changes in non-pancreatic organs. With the proposed project we aim to develop an innovative concept to address the reversibility of pancreatic beta cell injury and success of diabetes mellitus remission after diet intervention. Such an approach will help us find new treatment strategies, better stratify patients to different treatments, and together with existing or novel pharmacological and precision medicine approaches finally cure the disease.

118    Univ.Prof. Dr. SLAK RUPNIK Marjan    Swiss Institute of Allergy and Asthma Research    2017-10-01    2021-09-30    Role of epigenetic regulation and inflammasome in epithelial barrier in asthma and atopic dermatitis    Burden of Allergic Diseases: With an epidemic rise during the last 60 years, allergic diseases are affecting the lives of more than one billion people worldwide, and their prevalence is expected to reach up to 4 billion in 2050. Currently, 300 million people (4.2%) suffer from asthma, 500 million (6.5%) from atopic dermatitis (AD), 900 million (12 %) from allergic rhinitis) and 700 million (9%) from food allergy worldwide. The prevalence of these four allergic diseases is approximately 1.7 million 22% in Switzerland. Atopic dermatitis is the most prevalent chronic disease in childhood. Asthma represents one of the highest costs to health care system. Allergic rhinitis is the number one disease for job absenteeism (missing work days) and presenteeism (being on the job, but not fully functioning because of disease). Approximately, 5-10% of all of these diseases present with severe forms and can cause deaths. It was recently shown by us and others that epithelial tight junction barrier defect plays an important role in the pathogenesis of these diseases.Epithelial barrier function: of asthmatic bronchial epithelial cells, sinus epithelial cells in chronic rhinosinusitis and skin keratinocytes in atopic dermatitis have been demonstrated to be defective and leaky. Allergens, bacterial toxins and other particles are able to penetrate the leaky epithelium, where they may activate the immune system cells leading to severe chronic inflammation. Epithelial tight junctions (TJ) are responsible for the regulation of paracellular flux and epithelial impermeability and can be considered as gatekeepers that could contribute both to aggravation of inflammation-related tissue damage or resolution of inflammation via drainage towards out side of the affected tissues. This study focuses on the regulation of particularly TJ barrier by epigenetic mechanisms and inflammasome.Planned experiments: According to our strong preliminary data, we hypothesize here that “epithelial tight junction barrier is epigenetically controlled” and “epithelial barrier leakiness is affected by inflammasome and both TJ barrier and inflammasome are epigenetically regulated”. We will perform this research in asthma and atopic dermatitis in parallel and particularly focus on in vivo relevant findings that will be obtained from direct human primary cells and biopsies as well as mouse models. We aim to demonstrate epigenetic mechanisms of bronchial and skin epithelial barrier leakiness in different endotypes and phenotypes of asthma and atopic dermatitis and bring a new perspective from bench to patient side. We will use several important and in vivo relevant stimulants to study the “barrier”, “epigenetics” and “inflammasome” triangle. They will be house dust mite, human rhinovirus, commercial detergents and their surfactants, and CpG oligonucleotides. In this way, we will be able to investigate barrier damaging and recovering as well as inflammasome-activating and -nonactivating stimulants.Impact and innovative potential: The ultimate aim of this research is to find out novel preventive and treatment ways for two major allergic diseases, asthma and atopic dermatitis to decrease the individual burden of the patients and their families, which affects almost half of the World’s population and extremely high health care costs. Our research includes disease endo and phenotyping concepts and opens a new window for a precision medicine approach to barrier leakiness, such as the establishment of leaky barrier endotype. Many aspects of this research will find broader impact in other disciplines of human and veterinary medicine, because similar mechanisms of epithelial barrier dysregulation play roles in other diseases such as chronic rhinosinusitis, COPD and inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, epigenetic regulation of inflammasome activation thresholds has a link to essentially all inflammatory diseases.    Swiss National Science Foundation    Project funding (Div.

119    Univ.Prof. Dr. SLAK RUPNIK Marjan    University of Lausanne    2017-01-01    2019-12-31    Systems level understanding of the genetic architecture of complex human traits    With the advent of the deluge of Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and advances in methodologies, the gap between the heritability estimated by twin-studies and explained by GWA studies, termed as the missing heritability, is closing rapidly. The enormous number of samples included in these analyses resulted in the robust association of thousands of genetic markers with a wide range of complex diseases. However, the interpretation, fine-mapping of such variants and their complex interplay with the environment are still under-investigated. In this research programme we propose to investigate the following three interconnected lines of research:1.We propose to reveal important modifiers of obesity-associated genetic effects through the following sub-projects:•We will test gene-lifestyle (nutrition, smoking, alcohol, caffeine) interactions•We will assess the pitfalls of gene-environment interaction analysis (with particular focus on index event bias)•We will explore parent-of-origin effect for obesity and gene expression regulation•We will identify genomic regions showing assortative mating pattern and examine their implication for disease via overlapping them with trait-associated loci2.To better fine-map association signals we will•implement substantial improvements for summary statistic imputation•introduce probabilistic copy number variant (CNV) calling and perform large-scale CNV association meta-analyses for obesity traits3.Estimating the joint causal effects of risk factors (such as lifestyle and molecular phenotypes) on obesity will facilitate the integration of previously published, exposure-associated GWAS findings into Bayesian priors to boost statistical power in order to detect novel obesity associations. Such approach will also enable the stratification of both diseases and samples into subgroups with similar profile and accelerate the understanding of disease mechanisms.The proposed research axes not only elucidate the fine genetic architecture of complex disease, but also utilize these genetic findings to unravel a complex causal network of genetic- and other risk factors leading to disease in various environmental settings. Comprehending these intricate disease mechanisms is key for prevention, diagnostics, and precision medicine.    Swiss National Science Foundation    Project funding (Div. I-III)    474000.0CHF

However as we enter the era of precision medicine, poor representation of some cancer types, insufficient numbers to capture the genetic diversity of cancer, lack of clinical outcome data and lack of comparison to normal reference sample limit their use. Novel cell culturing methods such as organoid derivation have revolutionised our ability to derive cell line models from both healthy and diseased tissue, and have the potential to overcome these limitations. We intend to create new cancer organoid cell line models from multiple tumour types as an experimental tool. These cell lines will be characterised at the level of the genome and transcriptome, profiled for differential response to anti-cancer therapies, and made available to the research community. We anticipate that this highly annotated resource will have broad applications and serve to catalyse a new wave of discovery in fundamental cancer biology and therapeutics.

Scientific Strategic Objectives ?Change clinical practice by actively pursuing the conduct of clinical trials to evaluate new technologies and to clinically qualify putative predictive validated biomarkers. ?Further develop a dynamic trials portfolio aligned with CRUK and ICR/RM strategies. ?Fully exploit data from ICR-CTSU trials to investigate effects of putative biomarkers and routinely measured disease characteristics and generate hypotheses for future research. ?Ensure sustainability of ICR-CTSU as a world leading academic CTU and its continued contribution to cancer science and patient care. Research Plan ICR-CTSU will work with key clinical and scientific opinion leaders to design, conduct and analyse clinical trials based on cutting edge research aiming to impact clinical practice worldwide. Strong quality management systems will underpin effective and efficient trial conduct. ICR-CTSU will deliver a cohesive programme of trials within focussed areas whilst developing new partnerships in others. Specific aims are: In systemic treatment of breast cancer ?Develop biomarker-driven trial platforms, incorporate surrogate endpoints for peri-operative/neoadjuvant trials and explore their potential for use in the adjuvant setting. ?Lead and/or collaborate within target-oriented and pragmatic national/international trials to further refine treatment. In systemic treatment of urological cancers ?Develop randomised phase II/III trials to define treatment strategies for metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer, incorporating biomarkers for patient selection and/or early assessment of response. ?Develop trials in the surgical urology setting, with a focus on non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. In radiotherapy, across portfolios (breast, urological and head & neck cancers) ?Deliver a coordinated programme of national trials optimising radiotherapy delivery and harnessing contemporary technologies. ?Explore relationships between efficacy and safety outcomes, aiming to personalise treatment by identifying factors predicting radiosensitivity and target radiotherapy to those with greatest clinical need. In other (rare) cancers ?Evaluate novel targeted therapies, with strategic involvement in international rare cancer initiatives, maximising opportunities for integrated translational research. How results will be used ICR-CTSU trials have changed clinical practice. Efficient trial conduct, high quality data and statistical analyses will enable trial results to be published in high quality journals bringing widespread influence and potential for impact on oncological practice.

133    Professor McKenna William Gillies    University of Oxford    2015-05-01    2017-04-30    Oxford CRUK Major Centre    Supporting research throughout the cycle of discovery. (http://www.cancercentre.ox.ac.uk) The vision of the Centre spans the research spectrum – from fundamental sciences through the translational pipeline and into clinical care with outputs feeding back into a cycle of discovery. To deliver this vision, we have focused our activity in key themes with our investments emphasising support for translational activity. We seek to partner with other funding bodies to continue to develop our fundamental sciences and deliver our clinical trials portfolio. We also pursue collaborative opportunities with other institutions across the UK and internationally to support our research objectives. As a CRUK-funded Centre we are committed to complimenting the priorities of CRUK’s new research strategy; looking for new opportunities to support their vision to beat cancer sooner. Research Strategy The Centre focuses on its strengths in radiotherapy and early phase trials in small cohorts of molecularly stratified patients, seeking novel combinations of treatments and utilisation of cutting edge technologies. We are expanding the definition of ‘personalisation of treatment’: interlinking specific molecular and genetic patient data with functional imaging to select the most effective experimental combination of surgical, radiotherapy and systemic interventions. We are committed to delivering this vision of precision medicine, through the Precision Cancer Medicine Institute (PCMI). To achieve this bold ambition we must draw from the broad range of expertise Oxford provides; from mathematicians to surgeons, chemists to epidemiologists, biologists to medical oncologists. We will work with scientists and clinicians from a variety of disciplines and not allow traditional boundaries to prevent new collaborations. We also foster networking in the Centre creating an ongoing dialogue across our wide ranging membership, leading to collaborations with help research realise its clinical impact. Scientific Areas of Interest Our disease sites of interest reflect the breadth and depth of activity here in Oxford. We have well established programmes in breast, melanoma, colorectal, urological, sarcoma, ovarian and blood cancers, where our work integrates internal research activity from across a range of disciplines to engage or lead in national and international networks. We aim to further expand our programmes in oesophageal, pancreas, brain and lung cancers through further investment in recruitment, support of our strategic working groups and engagement with national research networks. We see these as critical areas of focus for the future; to apply our world leading research to areas which can have significant impact for patients and to support CRUK’s ambition of addressing areas of unmet need. We are also expanding our scientific focus to include emerging areas of interest including tumour immunology, clinical informatics and proton beam therapy. Other Areas of Activity We invest in underpinning platforms of support which span the breadth of our cancer research community. Schemes such as the Development Fund, our networking events and working groups, and the Centre’s Annual Symposium provide the springboard for new ideas and innovations to be launched. All members across the Centre have access to these activities, which offer the opportunity for new connections, deeper collaborations and research innovation. We also foster a culture of engagement to enable Oxford’s science and CRUK’s investment to reach a wider audience. We believe that inspiring people with our research can bring hope that beating cancer is within reach. Finally, our training programme for the Centre’s clinical and non-clinical students takes full advantage of the enriched training environment that Oxford provides and enables us to recruit the best trainees, who we hope will go on to become our future leaders. For the future, we aim to continue to raising Oxford’s national and international reputation for cancer research; driving the research agenda and delivering world-class research which will be of benefit to patients.
