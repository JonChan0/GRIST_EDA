1	Dr Roger Williams	MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology	None	1997-01-01	2010-03-31	Structural studies of phosphoinositide signalling and intracellular sorting	Eukaryotic cells have evolved a number of mechanisms to respond to environmental stress. These stress responses are tempered by growth factors and other signals from surrounding cells in multicellular organisms. Our research programme involves the mechanisms whereby these cellular signals are coupled to regulation of anabolic and catabolic processes in mammalian cells. Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) modify lipid membranes and the modified phospholipids produced by the enzymes serve as second messengers and sorting signals in eukaryotic cells. The PI3Ks are essential for cell response to environmental cues, and play essential roles in innate and adaptive immune responses. Our most recent work is examining the roles of PI3Ks in immune response to cancers and in pathology characteristic of late-stage covid-19 infection. PI3Ks are part of a larger family of kinases known as the PI3K-related kinases (PIKKs). We study the structures, dynamics and functions of PI3Ks and PIKKs in cellular signalling, sorting, stress response and DNA damage repair. This includes almost all of the members of the PI3K family: class I PI3Ks activated by receptor tyrosine kinase and GPCRS, the primordial class III PI3K complex present in all eukaryotes, the golgi-associated PI4K, the PI3K related protein kinases (PIKKs) mTOR, ATM and ATR. Each of these PIKKs is a regulatory nexus, and our work produces variants in which specific regulatory inputs of the large enzyme complexes are ablated without affecting other activities. These modified complexes provide tools to decipher cellular regulation in ways that would not be possible with other approaches. We use X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to marry structures with dynamics. In collaboration with our pharmaceutical partners, we are seeking to develop HDX-MS approaches to give better insight into conformational dynamics that could result in new therapeutic strategies. On-going efforts in the group concern the structural and dynamic basis of regulation of oncogenic PI3Ks, autophagic PI3K complexes, integration of amino acid and growth factor sensing in the PI3K pathway, and DNA damage repair.

No specific treatment has yet been proven in rigorous clinical trials to be effective against COVID-19. Most clinical trials are hospital-based. Yet, most cases are managed in the community, so interventions proven to be effective are urgently in primary care that prevent hospitalisation and speed recovery. PRINCIPLE will be a Phase III, platform, response-adaptive, open-label randomised controlled trial in primary care. The platform trial will operate under a master protocol that allows the addition or replacement of further interventions. Outcome data will be analysed as the trial is in progress: if evidence emerges that one arm is more effective, we might be able to allocate more people to that arm. PRINCIPLE will, in the first instance, evaluate usual care plus hydroxychloroquine 200mg twice a day for 7 days. This drug is already in wide use, but not for this indication. The comparator will be usual care without a study drug. Eligible patients will be aged ≥50-64 years with a defined comorbidity, and patients aged ≥65 with or without comorbidity presenting within 7 days since onset of symptoms with a new continuous cough and/or high temperature during time of prevalent COVID-19 infection. Approximately 3000 eligible participants will need to be randomised in the first instance in order to determine whether the first drug we plan to evaluate is more effective than usual care alone in preventing hospital admission and/or death in people with suspected COVID-19.

A key discovery that we have made during the tenure of thisaward, is that the mechanism of action of the peptides is highly likely to be the dispersal of heparansulphate-bearing proteins at the host cell surface. These proteins (e.g. syndecan-1) are usuallylocated in tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEM). CD9 is found at high levels on most epithelialsurfaces and is a critical component of TEM in these cells. We have shown that many types ofpathogenic bacteria, and some fungi, use heparan sulphates as an adhesion platform, allowing theirattachment to host cells to enable later events, such as internalisation and transcytosis acrossepithelial layers. CD9 peptides and heparin, a soluble analogue of heparan sulphate, give identicalinhibition of bacterial attachment.We note that some viruses, e.g. herpes simplex, also use heparan sulphates during cell attachment.Coronaviruses such as human NL63, OC43 and SARS-CoV, have also been reported to adhere toheparan sulphates. The furin cleavage motif (RRXRR) found in several human coronaviruses stronglyresembles a heparan sulphate binding motif (XBBXBX or XBBBXXBX). In SARS-CoV-2, the putativefurin site is PRRARSV and is thought to be an important adaption that allowed the transfer ofvirulence between animals and humans.In preliminary work, we have shown that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (containing S1 and S2 domains)binds strongly to the human RT4 epithelial cell line that expresses low levels of receptor ACE2 andproteases TMPRSS2 and ADAM17. In contrast, recombinant S1 domain, a smaller fragment of S1containing only the receptor-binding domain and a mutant form of S1S2 spike protein that lacks thefurin cleavage site, bind at very low levels. Unfractionated heparin, at 0.1U/ml, can inhibit wild typeS1S2 binding, reducing it to the very low levels detected for the other spike proteins. Surfen, aheparan sulphate binding aminoquinoline, can also inhibit S1S2 binding.We interpret these data as an indication that SARS-CoV-2 has a high affinity for heparan sulphates,and that this interaction with the host cell surface can occur in cell lines with only minimal ACE2expression. Heparan sulphates may therefore be important in the retention of virus at an epithelialsurface prior to internalisation and infection via ACE2, a protein paradoxically found only at lowlevels in airway epithelia. Heparin may inhibit this interaction, and so lower the rate of infection. Wenote that low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is already used therapeutically with some successin late stage Covid-19 patients to treat hypercoagulation.We would therefore like to repurpose this award to allow us to make a fuller investigation of SARSCoV-2 use of heparan sulphates before alerting clinicians to the possibility that heparin or LMWHtreatment earlier in Covid-19, perhaps even before blood clotting disorders develop, would bebeneficial. There are also heparin analogues and heparan sulphate antagonists that have been usedclinically for other indications (e.g. Fondaparinux, Ciraparantag) that we would like to test forinhibition of S1S2 binding. Finally, we would like to be able to test (by collaboration) the effects ofheparin and analogues in a live virus infection assay. We envisage that this work will take 4-6 weeks,enabling the full resources of the MRC award to be used in Sheffield: at least part-time effort byPDRA, technician and the associated PhD student, funding for drug synthesis and the purchase ofrecombinant viral proteins. During this period, we would apply to the UKRI Rapid Response Call forfurther funding to help transfer this research into clinical practice.This work would make minimal impact on the original aims of the award, as we are currently unableto make progress in the UK or India. It will also feedback into the original award because we wouldalso be able to test Surfen, Fondaparinux and Ciraparantag, etc as inhibitors of bacterial infection.

The latter can either control viral infection or exacerbate disease due to uncontrolled inflammatory processes that damages tissues. Hence, in order to establish the efficacy of antiviral therapies and determine whether stratification can aid clinical decisions in COVID19 patients, we need to identify correlates of disease severity and response to treatment. This proposal aims to fully determine the dynamic viral and immunological changes occurring during the different clinical stages of COVID-19. We will use a clinical trial for Favipiravir (GETAFIX, GLA3), an antiviral drug as our test case to develop our biomarkers but can roll this project out to support other trials within ASTERIX (GLA2).

To elicit an antibody response the vaccine components must be taken-up by antigen presenting cells (APCs). We propose that modification of protein components from the SARSCoV-2 virus, by adding a specific sugar, will enhance their uptake by APCs and improve vaccine efficacy. We will perform this modification in a bacterium, Streptomyces lividans, which can be used for industrial-scale fermentation to rapidly produce the large quantities of vaccine components required for a nation-wide vaccination campaign.

10	Professor Davey Jones	Bangor University	None	2020-04-15	2021-04-14	Use of wastewater analysis to evaluate the incidence of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in the UK population	The emergence of the novel coronavirus strain SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is now viewed as a major global threat to human health. Recent estimates predict the deaths of 15 million people worldwide and that SARS-CoV-2 infections are likely to result in an economic loss £2.1 trillion GDP. Effective monitoring of this pathogen is vital to estimate the amount of infection circulating in the Human population, and to inform the design of measures for controlling the spread of disease. The number of hospitalization cases from SARS-CoV-2 related diseases (COVID-19) provides some measure of disease prevalence in the population, it provides no reliable information on mild infections and asymptomatic carriers. The use of random 'spot checks' and thermal imaging cameras have been introduced to screen for infections, though these are costly to implement and very imprecise. Consequently, better methods are needed to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in the wider population. As SARS-CoV-2 is shed in faeces in high amounts (Xiao et al., 2020, Zhang et al., 2020), we hypothesize that wastewater can provide a powerful indicator of disease incidence at any point in time (Ye et al., 2016), particularly as most UK urban centres are served by only 1 or 2 wastewater treatment works, thereby providing a single integrated signal of millions of people in a single sample. The aim of this NERC Urgency project is therefore to: (1) use wastewater to provide near real-time information on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 within the UK population; (2) monitor the rise and subsequent decline of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK population, and to compare this to conventional disease reporting metrics (e.g. confirmed SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization cases); (3) identify similarities in the abundance of SARS-CoV-2 in the major urban centres of the UK; (4) demonstrate the use of wastewater for the integrated surveillance of human pathogenic viruses within the Human population; (5) provide stakeholders (e.g. national government, NHS, HPA, PHE, PHW, HPS, water companies etc) with critical scientific information and tools to be able to respond and adapt to current and potential future disease epidemics.

11	Professor Mark Viney	University of Liverpool	None	2020-04-27	2021-04-26	The exposure of urban rodents to the human COVID-19 virus and the potential for viral recombination	All of us are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by a virus (technically, SARS-CoV-2) that originally jumped from an animal (probably a bat) into a person. Now the virus is spreading person-to-person directly. COVID-19 is a coronavirus, and coronaviruses are very common in wild animals. While each coronavirus typically infects one species of animal, coronaviruses can move between animal species too. So the general idea is that animals are "reservoirs" of viruses that sometimes moves into people. Because so many people are getting infected with COVID-19, we think that humans might now be a virus reservoir infecting animals. If this does happen, it's most likely where there are high densities of people and of animals - such as rodents in cities, where large numbers of people and rodents live cheek-by-jowl. This is the idea we want to test. But why does this matter? Different viruses can also mix their genetics (technically, recombine), and so we also wonder if the human COVID-19 does infect rodents, whether it will then recombine with other coronaviruses already in those rodents. There are a lots of 'ifs' in these last few sentences, which is because these are just theories that we have. We now want to see if these theories - these 'ifs' - are correct. To do this we want to catch city-dwelling rats and mice that we'll then screen for the human COVID-19 virus, or close relatives of it.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	170285.0 GBP

We will determine novel chemical matter for further development, identify existing drugs for repurposing and highlight off-target drug binding Urgency: The type of data we are able to generate is needed now to feed into drug discovery programmes; it cannot be obtained through other experimental platforms in the same timescale (6 months)Our approach: we will probe associations in viral assembly and cellular entry pathways using our bespoke massspectrometry (MS) platform (Nature Methods in press). We will monitor the oligomeric status of proteins their ligand binding capacity and PTM status within individual experiments.Objective 1: inhibit Mpro through disruption of the monomer dimer interface.Mpro, a key CoV enzyme, mediates viral replication and transcription. Mpro shares considerable homology withMERS-CoV Mpro which showed substrate-induced dimerization with proteolytic activity. We have proof-ofconceptdata that show the monomer-dimer equilibrium enabling us to screen to disrupt dimer interactionsusing our unique MS platform.Objective 2: understand antigen processing and interactionsPrevious SARS-CoV infections suggest that glycosylation of a specific residue abrogates S protein binding implyingthat interfering with glycosylation could impede recognition. We will investigate how S protein glycans affectassociations with ACE2 to inform design of glycoprotein processing inhibitors.Objective 3: characterise the oligomeric states and binding sites of ACE2The SLC B0AT1 supports dimerization of ACE2. How do lipids, proteases (TMPRSS2) and other small moleculesregulate its activity? We will apply MS-based methods, optimized to study membrane proteins, protein-protein,and protein-ligand interactions to this complex.Feasibility/Critical mass: All proteins are available immediately through collaboration with the SGC Oxford. Wealso have unique chemical libraries that can be deployed for this project as well as bespoke instrumentation. Ourdepartment is open for COVID-19 work only. I have secured permission for access and have engaged a dedicatedteam of highly experienced researchers.Accessibility: High-throughput screens using X-ray structures are ongoing in Oxford and feed into the COVID-19Therapeutics Accelerator Consortium. We will communicate all our findings immediately to this, and other localand national initiatives, including national repositories where they can be accessed immediately.

Older people are at high risk because of the presence of long-term health conditions, problems with mobility, as well as social isolation due to lower levels of internet use compared with the rest of the population. The repercussions of this crisis will be considerable and long-lasting. Research for years to come will need to understand who has been most affected economically and socially, and how policymakers can best help them in the long run. Additionally, researchers need to study the crisis now, and policymakers' responses to it, in order to make future health and social systems more resilient to such events in the future. There is a strong scientific case for collecting data in the time of the crisis within the framework of existing longitudinal data and infrastructure investments that already form a large part of the evidence base when it comes to understanding the links between health, economic welfare, family and social structures. There is an urgent need to monitor these processes in order to identify the extent of adverse experience, to learn how to promote resilience, and to inform policy. ELSA is uniquely positioned to do this for older people. Our aim is to carry out assessments of a large well characterized sample of men and women aged over 50 who are participants in the long running English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). We will implement an internet assessment of the complete sample (more than 9,000 people), with telephone interviews to ensure people who are not able to use the internet can participate. We will measure experiences of COVID-19, changes in financial circumstances, work and caregiving, mental and physical health, social contact and loneliness, health and social care, stress and worries. The survey will be carried out in June 2020, with a second assessment in September/October. The study will inform policy makers and researchers about the diverse impacts of COVID-19.

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project. This project aims to rapidly progress a self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vaccine against the 2019 novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) to first in human studies (phase I) within a matter of months. Within 14 days of accessing the sequence we have already designed and constructed a candidate saRNA vaccine expressing a pre-fusion stabilised conformation of the native surface glycoprotein (S-protein). This design maximises the potential for induction of neutralising antibodies while minimising the induction for off-target responses to post-fusion conformations. We have engaged key manufacturing partners able to generate GMP material not only for phase I/II studies according to a very tight schedule but also with the capability to rapidly scale to millions of doses should this be required. This cutting-edge nucleic acid vaccine platform has been specifically designed for rapid manufacture and deployment in the event of an outbreak. SaRNA offers significant advantages over other nucleic acid vaccine platforms yielding exponentially higher levels of protein expression than messenger RNA (mRNA) or DNA. The self-amplifying properties of saRNA mean that much lower doses are required to induce protective immunity, providing a significant advantage to manufacturing costs and speed. Additionally, saRNA is not limited by anti-vector immunity and is safe to administer to individuals unable to receive live attenuated vaccines (e.g. children and the immunocompromised). The Target Product Profile (TPP) is a vaccine that can be rapidly manufactured at low cost and elicit protective immunity across all at risk populations within 6 weeks of administration, with the potential for repeat boosting as required.

The UK coronavirus immunology consortium (UK-CIC) will link the UK immunology community to deliver, at pace, a coordinated and agile national research programme. This will focus around 17 centres of excellence and address five key research themes: -The primary immune response and clinical outcome Here we will integrate immune datasets from patients at the time of primary infection to assess how this relates to clinical risk factors such as gender, ethnicity and age. We will compare and contrast patients with mild and severe disease -long term protective immunity This theme will focus on mechanisms of cellular immunity, how these responses are maintained over time, and how they relate to the severity of initial infection. The consortium incorporates intensive deep phenotyping of an ISARIC 4C follow up cohort. -mechanisms and prevention of immunopathology Using primary tissue samples and post-mortem material we will utilise start of the art technology to assess how viral replication and immune mechanisms mediate pathology, and how these can be prevented. -cross reactivity with seasonal coronaviruses Here we will focus on T cell cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronaviruses, using fresh and historical samples -viral immune evasion The virus mediates disease by evading host immunity. Here we will use molecular, proteomic and cellular approaches to define new, and potentially reversible, mechanisms of viral evasion. Research outcomes will be translated rapidly to policy makers, academic & industrial collaborators, and the public.

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project. EAVE (Early Estimation of vaccine and Anti-Viral Effectiveness) was a NIHR-funded project on pandemic influenza, which created a Scotland-wide cohort of 227,000 individuals recruited from 40 general practices together with stored serology samples from 1,000 individuals. EAVE established a national electronic cohort though linking health data sets from general practice, prescribing, hospitalisations and virology testing using the unique Community Health Identification (CHI) number for residents of Scotland. We plan to repurpose and expand this cohort to collect electronic data from 1.2m individuals living in Scotland to study COVID-19. We will augment the cohort by collecting and storing residual sera samples and by sequencing virus from patient specimens. Both of these, are being taken as part of routine care from a sample of these individuals. We will track the progress of the COVID-19 epidemic in near real-time using the EAVE II cohort. We will be able to model the full course of the epidemic from genome sequence data. Once a serological test becomes available we will be able to refine this model and provide precise estimates of the attack rates in different sub-populations, and accompanying hospitalisation and fatality rates. EAVE II will help to identify the clinical features of the epidemic and, in due course, provide estimates of the effectiveness of any vaccines and anti-viral therapies deployed. Ethical and Privacy Committee approval has previously been given for the EAVE study and we anticipate the same approvals will readily be obtained for this follow-on study.

Although many people survive, an estimated 1 to 4% die from this disease. There are more than 10,000 UK deaths from COVID-19, with numbers escalating. Many of the symptoms, such as breathlessness, fever, agitation and pain, are very distressing. But in this new disease these symptoms are not well understood. Palliative care services are adapting rapidly to this situation, but in different ways, not knowing what is best. This research aims to rapidly evaluate the palliative care response in COVID-19 to improve care now and in the future. There are two main components, called work packages (WPs), to the research. WP1 surveys, UK wide, palliative care medical or nursing leads, about their changes in practice, how they deploy the workforce, volunteers and technology, their innovations and challenges. WP2 collects data about patients' symptoms, how they change over time, and the effects of treatments. We collect this information immediately and quickly (phase I), and then repeat the data collection after 6-8 weeks (phase II) to understand how practice is changing. We involve patients, families, the public, policy makers and services in all stages of the research. We release early findings, to help catalyse an effective response.

They have difficulty remembering and understanding restrictions and precautions put in place to protect them and others, and may be distressed that non-resident family and social networks are compromised. In addition, there is currently reduced access to many formal care services. This may cause strain for people with dementia and co-resident and non-co-resident family carers, particularly those with a recent diagnosis who are attempting to come to terms with living with dementia and navigating the complex support landscape. We currently have few empirical data with which to help us to formulate how best to support them. We will address this gap by examining how a group of 266 people newly diagnosed with a range of severities of dementia in the months before the COVID-19 lockdown and their carers have been affected by COVID-19 and the predictors of better and worse outcomes (quality of life, depression, carer burden and physical health). They were recruited as part of the ESRC/NIHR-funded DETERMIND programme and have a rich baseline characterisation of socio-demographics, clinical state, and service use. Using telephone quantitative and qualitative interviews we will investigate what has happened to them and how outcomes vary by clinical and sociodemographic factors such as dementia severity, neuropsychiatric symptoms, service receipt, ethnicity, gender, and place of residence. We will use these data to generate practical guidance for services and families on how best to support people with dementia and carers in this and any future pandemic.

None	None	None	Understanding non- compliance with the International Health Regulations (2005): Recommended strategies to inform and strengthen global coordination of the COVID-19 outbreak response	Outbreaks such as the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) can result in inappropriate, excessive and counterproductive measures that hinder global coordination of outbreak response. Moreover, they compound loss of life and illness by contributing to unnecessary social and economic disruption, and can discourage countries from open reporting for fear of retaliation. For these reasons, the World Health Organization (WHO) declaration of the COVID-19 outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) included recommended, evidence-based measures for detection, containment and control based on available data. These measures adhere to International Health Regulations (IHR) principles concerning human rights, proportionality, and unnecessary interference with trade and travel. Yet preliminary analysis suggests a higher number and range of non-compliant measures are being adopted than previous PHEICs. The goal of this project is to strengthen global coordination of the COVID-19 outbreak response through a fuller understanding of crossborder measures adopted, their likely positive/negative impacts, reason(s) for adoption, and strategies to increase compliance. This project applies a mixed-methods approach to achieve 4 objectives: a) define, categorize and track crossborder measures adopted during the COVID-19 and previous outbreaks; b) systematically review existing evidence of their public health and wider impacts; c) understand decisions to adopt compliant or non-compliant measures in 4 case study settings (Australia, Canada, Hong Kong and US); and d) identify strategies to encourage increased compliance. Working closely with key knowledge users, including WHO, we will collect and analyze new data, and combine it with our existing datasets to conduct real time quantitative crossoutbreak analysis. The key outcome of this project is to mitigate the rapid spread of COVID-19 through practical, evidence-informed strategies that strengthen global coordination.

29	Dr Kelley Lee	Simon Fraser University (Burnaby, B.C.)	None	None	None	Understanding and mitigating real-time differential gendered effects of the COVID-19 outbreak	Infectious disease outbreaks are considered by policymakers as global, collective problems, assuming a similar impact of pathogens on all people. Yet, the impact of disease on individuals and communities is not homogenous, with women disproportionately affected. The sex and gendered dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak so far are anecdotal, but the consequences of sidelining these canlimit effective responses in affected regions, as well as prevention and preparedness efforts globally. This project will conduct a gender analysis to identify and document the differential gendered effects of the outbreak and gaps in preparedness and response measures in a dynamic way, providing real time guidance and recommendations to those crafting policy and public health interventions. We will: map and analyze sex disaggregated data on COVID-19 infections and mortality to provide evidence to inform public health responses, decision-making and planning; document and analyze gender impacts of the outbreak in order to strengthen understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on individuals and communities through chatroom and social media analysis and interviews with those infected and affected; conduct gender-based analysis of national and global responses through policy analysis and key informant interviews; produce knowledge translation resources, including a gender matrix and toolkit, to improve policy and public health responses to COVID-19. Findings will contribute to the global response of COVID-19 through strengthening understanding of how individuals and communities understand and react to the disease. The COVID-19 Gender Matrix will be a living, online tool presenting gender analysis questions and data as it is gathered and serving as a template to measure gender indicators, if and where the outbreak may spread. The COVID-19 Gender Toolkit will promote immediate gender mainstreamed actions within policy development, preparedness and response activities.

The residents are the frailest members of society, many with dementia, mental health/neuropsychiatric symptoms and/or concurrent physical illnesses. Providing support for these individuals is challenging for care staff who are facing a difficult, distressing and isolated work environment. We urgently need to support care staff and provide the best environment possible for care home residents. We developed a care home training intervention which improved quality of life, mental health and reduced sedative drug use across two large clinical trials in the NIHR WHELD programme. Subsequently we have evaluated and demonstrated benefits from a digital version of WHELD with virtual supervision. We will provide an adapted version of this programme to almost 1500 care homes. We will first develop specific adaptations for the COVID-19 crisis, such as peer networking and solution sharing, alongside evidence-based elements focussing on person-centred care, personalised activities, and reduction of unnecessary sedative medications. We will implement the optimized digital intervention in 160 care homes within four weeks, including virtual supervision. We will evaluate outcomes relating to staff mental health and attitudes, and resident quality of life, attainment of care goals, and use of sedative medications, and examine facilitators of and barriers to effective implementation. Building on the findings we will evaluate efficacy and cost-effectiveness in 1280 care homes using a randomized delayed start design. We will then make the programme "implementation ready" for national care home roll-out.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	1231436.0 GBP

The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated unprecedented restrictions on people’s movements and interactions in public and private settings, and led to the cancellation of major sports events and social activities. These consequences of the COVID-19 ‘lockdown’ have altered the gambling landscape worldwide. There is an urgent need to provide regulators, policy makers and treatment providers (e.g. World Health Organisation (WHO), Gambling Commission, All Party Parliamentary Group on online gambling harms) with high quality evidence on the changing patterns and context of gambling behaviours during COVID-19 and its aftermath. Insight is needed into: the actions undertaken by industry so regulators can consider immediate actions; understanding of new risk groups susceptible to gambling harms to develop effective prevention strategies; and understanding of the escalation and maintenance of harms to inform treatment and support provision. To meet this need, we will address three major research questions across three integrated workpackages: ‘How has COVID-19 changed gambling practices, and the risk factors for and experience of gambling harms?’; ‘What is the effect of COVID-19 on gambling marketing?’; and ‘How has COVID-19 changed high risk groups’ gambling experiences and practices?’. Drawing on our extensive experience of mixed-methods research, we will focus on two groups at particular risk of adopting more risky, online gambling practices - young adults and sports bettors. The team will draw on their strong network of stakeholder partnerships to ensure timely dissemination and impact.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	580485.0 GBP

Almost 100% of patients showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in their lungs by chest CT scans indicating acute lung injury (ALI). Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanism(s) of ALI induced by SARS-CoV-2 is very important to inform vaccine safety and immunotherapeutic strategies. In this proposal, we will investigate the host immune responses and their association with severity of ALI in patient samples and animal models. We will bring together a team of experts with complementary expertise including immunopathology in coronavirus infections, up-to-date lab technologies, and know-how to ensure the feasibility of this study with the following goals: 1) defining SARS-CoV-2 specific serum profiles (epitopes) using yeast display antigen library 2) determining antibody functions including antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) vs neutralizing activities in vitro assays 3) studying T cell (CD4 and CD8) responses to whole SARS-CoV-2 genome 4) evaluating ALI in response to live SARS-CoV-2 infection with or without passive immunity (antibody or T cells) generated from vaccine candidates in a humanized mice model.

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project. This project aims to rapidly progress a self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vaccine against the 2019 novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) to first in human studies (phase I) within a matter of months. Within 14 days of accessing the sequence we have already designed and constructed a candidate saRNA vaccine expressing a pre-fusion stabilised conformation of the native surface glycoprotein (S-protein). This design maximises the potential for induction of neutralising antibodies while minimising the induction for off-target responses to post-fusion conformations. We have engaged key manufacturing partners able to generate GMP material not only for phase I/II studies according to a very tight schedule but also with the capability to rapidly scale to millions of doses should this be required. This cutting-edge nucleic acid vaccine platform has been specifically designed for rapid manufacture and deployment in the event of an outbreak. SaRNA offers significant advantages over other nucleic acid vaccine platforms yielding exponentially higher levels of protein expression than messenger RNA (mRNA) or DNA. The self-amplifying properties of saRNA mean that much lower doses are required to induce protective immunity, providing a significant advantage to manufacturing costs and speed. Additionally, saRNA is not limited by anti-vector immunity and is safe to administer to individuals unable to receive live attenuated vaccines (e.g. children and the immunocompromised). The Target Product Profile (TPP) is a vaccine that can be rapidly manufactured at low cost and elicit protective immunity across all at risk populations within 6 weeks of administration, with the potential for repeat boosting as required.

57	Professor Andrew Steptoe	University College London	None	None	None	English Longitudinal Study of Ageing COVID-19 Substudy	The COVID-19 crisis is having an unprecedented impact on people's lives from the perspectives of their health, psychological wellbeing, social activity, employment and financial circumstances. Older people are at high risk because of the presence of long-term health conditions, problems with mobility, as well as social isolation due to lower levels of internet use compared with the rest of the population. The repercussions of this crisis will be considerable and long-lasting. Research for years to come will need to understand who has been most affected economically and socially, and how policymakers can best help them in the long run. Additionally, researchers need to study the crisis now, and policymakers' responses to it, in order to make future health and social systems more resilient to such events in the future. There is a strong scientific case for collecting data in the time of the crisis within the framework of existing longitudinal data and infrastructure investments that already form a large part of the evidence base when it comes to understanding the links between health, economic welfare, family and social structures. There is an urgent need to monitor these processes in order to identify the extent of adverse experience, to learn how to promote resilience, and to inform policy. ELSA is uniquely positioned to do this for older people. Our aim is to carry out assessments of a large well characterized sample of men and women aged over 50 who are participants in the long running English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). We will implement an internet assessment of the complete sample (more than 9,000 people), with telephone interviews to ensure people who are not able to use the internet can participate. We will measure experiences of COVID-19, changes in financial circumstances, work and caregiving, mental and physical health, social contact and loneliness, health and social care, stress and worries. The survey will be carried out in June 2020, with a second assessment in September/October. The study will inform policy makers and researchers about the diverse impacts of COVID-19.

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project. EAVE (Early Estimation of vaccine and Anti-Viral Effectiveness) was a NIHR-funded project on pandemic influenza, which created a Scotland-wide cohort of 227,000 individuals recruited from 40 general practices together with stored serology samples from 1,000 individuals. EAVE established a national electronic cohort though linking health data sets from general practice, prescribing, hospitalisations and virology testing using the unique Community Health Identification (CHI) number for residents of Scotland. We plan to repurpose and expand this cohort to collect electronic data from 1.2m individuals living in Scotland to study COVID-19. We will augment the cohort by collecting and storing residual sera samples and by sequencing virus from patient specimens. Both of these, are being taken as part of routine care from a sample of these individuals. We will track the progress of the COVID-19 epidemic in near real-time using the EAVE II cohort. We will be able to model the full course of the epidemic from genome sequence data. Once a serological test becomes available we will be able to refine this model and provide precise estimates of the attack rates in different sub-populations, and accompanying hospitalisation and fatality rates. EAVE II will help to identify the clinical features of the epidemic and, in due course, provide estimates of the effectiveness of any vaccines and anti-viral therapies deployed. Ethical and Privacy Committee approval has previously been given for the EAVE study and we anticipate the same approvals will readily be obtained for this follow-on study.

The bid is backed by the major UK professional cardiovascular societies and the NIHR-BHF Cardiovascular Partnership have designated it as a “COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease UK Flagship Project” (see attached letter). Whilst up to 20% of hospitalised COVID-19 patients may have cardiac injury based on serum troponin (and associated with high mortality), this is non-specific and can relate to pericarditis, myocarditis, acute coronary syndromes, acute heart failure, arrhythmias, or simply hypoxia/sepsis/shock. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) can make a specific diagnosis and is recommended in European Society of Cardiology practice guidelines. We will use CMR to determine 1) the UK prevalence of acute myocardial injury/myocarditis secondary to COVID-19 and the severity of presentation; 2) how clinical outcomes associate with recognised risk factors for mortality such as age, sex, ethnicity and comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, and coronary/peripheral vascular disease; 3) if there are differences in myocardial recovery at 6 months dependent on demographics, genetics and comorbidities, and how this impacts on patient quality of life and functional capacity; 4) if we can improve the ECG diagnosis of myocarditis minimising the requirement for invasive cardiac investigations. Ethics approval has been granted for clinical CMR scans enabling us to start quickly, and if funded we would extend this approval to include the additional research scans, other investigations, patient reported outcome measures.

Information is urgently needed to evaluate the evolving palliative and end of life care response. This knowledge is vital to optimise health care delivery, and to manage symptoms, as no evidence currently exists. This research aims to rapidly and robustly evaluate the UK palliative care and end of life care response in COVID-19 in terms of services, workforce and symptom management to optimise patient and family care. Design: Rapid, multicentre observational study, comprising two main work packages. WP1. Online survey of clinical leads of UK community, hospital and inpatient palliative care and hospice services, to map and understand their workforce and volunteer deployment, innovations, challenges and clinical practices in response to COVID-19. WP2. Prospective cohort study of the characteristics, symptoms and clinical care experienced by patients within palliative care and hospice services (selected purposively from those responding to WP1), to understand the prevalence and trajectory of symptoms, treatments received, and their effects (benefits, any harms). Both WPs run initially (phase I) and are repeated (phase II) after 6-8 weeks. This examines practice changes, successes and difficulties. In addition, in phase II we integrate case studies of successful innovations and challenges, that provide in-depth insights. Active policy, patient and public engagement is incorporated in all phases of the research, including with charitable and statutory bodies, NHS England, Public Health England, and our NIHR/ARC supported virtual Patient and Public Palliative Care forum.

The spread and outbreak of the virus in care homes has varied greatly across the sector, sometimes with devastating impact. The incidence and death rate from COVID-19 in UK care homes is, as yet, not known. However, until effective vaccines for the virus are available, older care home residents will remain vulnerable and at greater risk of poorer outcome if they were to contract COVID-19. Capturing lessons learnt about the symptoms, progression and management of this viral infection in the older population (aged over 65 years) and sharing these lessons learnt with care homes that have not yet experienced an outbreak of the virus is crucial. This is the focus for our work. We will conduct four phases of work. First, we will interview up to 30 health and social care practitioners, caring for older people (aged over 65 years) in hospitals and care homes. We will ask practitioners to reflect on what they have learnt about the symptoms of the virus in this population and its progression, in particular what worked well (or what more is needed) when caring for older people with the virus. In the next phase, we will share these lessons learnt (Phase 1) with up to 10 senior care home staff and discuss strategies that are being, or could be used, for managing COVID-19 in care homes. We will use these findings to design an online survey of care home providers to ‘sense-check’ our findings and identify any further gaps that need to be addressed at a national level. The final phase will be to co-create resources with and for the sector and informed by the findings of this work.	The Dunhill Medical Trust	Research Project & Programme Grants	15000.0 GBP

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project. Efficient response to COVID-19 requires an understanding of the epidemiological and behavioural drivers of disease transmission. Due to the rapidly evolving outbreak and the mitigation strategies likely to be put in place at different times, analyses of epidemic drivers and policy evaluation need constant updating to provide relevant data-driven evidence to inform evolving public health choices. We will provide rapid, continually updated estimates of key epidemiological features such as disease severity and transmissibility measures and lengths of stay. Surveillance, serological and sequence data (where available) will be analysed accounting for censoring and reporting delays. Mathematical models will be fit to the emerging data streams using Bayesian methods to provide regular forecasting updates and assess the impact of current or potential future interventions. Contact and precautionary behaviours will be monitored in a representative cohort along with information on risk awareness and perceived efficacy of interventions to refine transmission models, improve forecasting, and assess the effectiveness of social distancing measures. Special attention will be given to sharing results in an open and timely manner. Epidemiological parameter estimates and forecasts will be shared on a public website, updated daily. User-friendly web interfaces will allow users to generate model outputs and investigate the impact of specific model assumptions on different policy findings. Highlights of essential results will be gathered in short policy briefs updated weekly. Findings will immediately inform UK policy through participation on UK Government advisory committees.

75	Professor Kate Hunt	University of Stirling	None	None	None	Transitions to more harmful forms of gambling during Covid-19 pandemic: behaviours and targeted marketing in young people and bettors on sport	Around 2 million people experience harms from gambling, and many gamble on live events (including sports) and online. The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated unprecedented restrictions on people’s movements and interactions in public and private settings, and led to the cancellation of major sports events and social activities. These consequences of the COVID-19 ‘lockdown’ have altered the gambling landscape worldwide. There is an urgent need to provide regulators, policy makers and treatment providers (e.g. World Health Organisation (WHO), Gambling Commission, All Party Parliamentary Group on online gambling harms) with high quality evidence on the changing patterns and context of gambling behaviours during COVID-19 and its aftermath. Insight is needed into: the actions undertaken by industry so regulators can consider immediate actions; understanding of new risk groups susceptible to gambling harms to develop effective prevention strategies; and understanding of the escalation and maintenance of harms to inform treatment and support provision. To meet this need, we will address three major research questions across three integrated workpackages: ‘How has COVID-19 changed gambling practices, and the risk factors for and experience of gambling harms?’; ‘What is the effect of COVID-19 on gambling marketing?’; and ‘How has COVID-19 changed high risk groups’ gambling experiences and practices?’.

76	Professor Xiao-Ning Xu	Imperial College	None	None	None	A comprehensive study of immunopathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection’	Since December 2019 the emergence of severe acute respiratory infections (COVID-19) in China, caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has posed a huge threat to global health with fatality rates up to 10% in elderly patients. Almost 100% of patients showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in their lungs by chest CT scans indicating acute lung injury (ALI). Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanism(s) of ALI induced by SARS-CoV-2 is very important to inform vaccine safety and immunotherapeutic strategies. In this proposal, we will investigate the host immune responses and their association with severity of ALI in patient samples and animal models. We will bring together a team of experts with complementary expertise including immunopathology in coronavirus infections, up-to-date lab technologies, and know-how to ensure the feasibility of this study with the following goals: 1) defining SARS-CoV-2 specific serum profiles (epitopes) using yeast display antigen library 2) determining antibody functions including antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) vs neutralizing activities in vitro assays 3) studying T cell (CD4 and CD8) responses to whole SARS-CoV-2 genome 4) evaluating ALI in response to live SARS-CoV-2 infection with or without passive immunity (antibody or T cells) generated from vaccine candidates in a humanized mice model.

None	None	None	Understanding non- compliance with the International Health Regulations (2005): Recommended strategies to inform and strengthen global coordination of the COVID-19 outbreak response	Outbreaks such as the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) can result in inappropriate, excessive and counterproductive measures that hinder global coordination of outbreak response. Moreover, they compound loss of life and illness by contributing to unnecessary social and economic disruption, and can discourage countries from open reporting for fear of retaliation. For these reasons, the World Health Organization (WHO) declaration of the COVID-19 outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) included recommended, evidence-based measures for detection, containment and control based on available data. These measures adhere to International Health Regulations (IHR) principles concerning human rights, proportionality, and unnecessary interference with trade and travel. Yet preliminary analysis suggests a higher number and range of non-compliant measures are being adopted than previous PHEICs. The goal of this project is to strengthen global coordination of the COVID-19 outbreak response through a fuller understanding of crossborder measures adopted, their likely positive/negative impacts, reason(s) for adoption, and strategies to increase compliance. This project applies a mixed-methods approach to achieve 4 objectives: a) define, categorize and track crossborder measures adopted during the COVID-19 and previous outbreaks; b) systematically review existing evidence of their public health and wider impacts; c) understand decisions to adopt compliant or non-compliant measures in 4 case study settings (Australia, Canada, Hong Kong and US); and d) identify strategies to encourage increased compliance. Working closely with key knowledge users, including WHO, we will collect and analyze new data, and combine it with our existing datasets to conduct real time quantitative crossoutbreak analysis. The key outcome of this project is to mitigate the rapid spread of COVID-19 through practical, evidence-informed strategies that strengthen global coordination.

None	None	None	Understanding and mitigating real-time differential gendered effects of the COVID-19 outbreak	Infectious disease outbreaks are considered by policymakers as global, collective problems, assuming a similar impact of pathogens on all people. Yet, the impact of disease on individuals and communities is not homogenous, with women disproportionately affected. The sex and gendered dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak so far are anecdotal, but the consequences of sidelining these canlimit effective responses in affected regions, as well as prevention and preparedness efforts globally. This project will conduct a gender analysis to identify and document the differential gendered effects of the outbreak and gaps in preparedness and response measures in a dynamic way, providing real time guidance and recommendations to those crafting policy and public health interventions. We will: map and analyze sex disaggregated data on COVID-19 infections and mortality to provide evidence to inform public health responses, decision-making and planning; document and analyze gender impacts of the outbreak in order to strengthen understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on individuals and communities through chatroom and social media analysis and interviews with those infected and affected; conduct gender-based analysis of national and global responses through policy analysis and key informant interviews; produce knowledge translation resources, including a gender matrix and toolkit, to improve policy and public health responses to COVID-19. Findings will contribute to the global response of COVID-19 through strengthening understanding of how individuals and communities understand and react to the disease. The COVID-19 Gender Matrix will be a living, online tool presenting gender analysis questions and data as it is gathered and serving as a template to measure gender indicators, if and where the outbreak may spread. The COVID-19 Gender Toolkit will promote immediate gender mainstreamed actions within policy development, preparedness and response activities.

No evidence-based nursing protocols exist to address the unique challenges of nursing hospitalised patients with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Aim: to co-create and evaluate the impact on patient experience, care quality, functional ability, treatment outcomes and costs of a nursing care protocol specifically addressing the fundamental care requirements of hospitalised patients with the SARS-CoV-2 virus not invasively ventilated. Methods: 2-stage mixed-methods programme, following revised 2020 complex interventions guidance, of: 1) rapid-review, survey, co-creation consensus development of a nursing protocol; 2) rapid-cycle cluster randomised controlled trial with embedded process and economic evaluations. Deliverables: 1.Fundamental nursing care protocol for hospitalised patients with the SARS-CoV-2 virus not invasively ventilated, with proven effectiveness on patient experience, care quality, functional ability and treatment outcomes within 9 months of project inception. 2.Feasible, acceptable and 'implementation-optimised' protocol for widespread implementation, through co-creation and changes implemented during rapid cycle trial waves. 3.Adaptable protocol designed to be generalisable for environments such as care homes, patients with other conditions requiring isolation and to global health systems via knowledge gained in a process analysis of intervention fidelity, mechanisms, contextual factors and implementation. 4.Guidelines, education materials and strategies accessible via Health Education England, the Open University's FutureLearn web platform, and experienced NHS sites acting as training hubs for other health Trusts/care homes/global health systems.

Information is urgently needed to evaluate the evolving palliative and end of life care response. This knowledge is vital to optimise health care delivery, and to manage symptoms, as no evidence currently exists. This research aims to rapidly and robustly evaluate the UK palliative care and end of life care response in COVID-19 in terms of services, workforce and symptom management to optimise patient and family care. Design: Rapid, multicentre observational study, comprising two main work packages. WP1. Online survey of clinical leads of UK community, hospital and inpatient palliative care and hospice services, to map and understand their workforce and volunteer deployment, innovations, challenges and clinical practices in response to COVID-19. WP2. Prospective cohort study of the characteristics, symptoms and clinical care experienced by patients within palliative care and hospice services (selected purposively from those responding to WP1), to understand the prevalence and trajectory of symptoms, treatments received, and their effects (benefits, any harms). Both WPs run initially (phase I) and are repeated (phase II) after 6-8 weeks. This examines practice changes, successes and difficulties. In addition, in phase II we integrate case studies of successful innovations and challenges, that provide in-depth insights. Active policy, patient and public engagement is incorporated in all phases of the research, including with charitable and statutory bodies, NHS England, Public Health England, and our NIHR/ARC supported virtual Patient and Public Palliative Care forum.

Specifically this proposal sets out to mitigate the impact of the COVID- 19 outbreak on children, families and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) by evaluating an innovative, potentially cost-effective, digital intervention for child anxiety problems. The focus is on child anxiety problems because (i) they are the most common mental health problem across the lifespan, (ii) they typically first occur in childhood and are a common reason for referral to CAMHS, (iii) fears, worries, and anxieties have been fuelled by the current context which has increased perceptions of threat and uncertainty, and (iv) CAMHS have identified children with anxiety problems as a key risk group in the context of COVID-19- both during lockdown and as social distancing measures are relaxed. We will conduct a multi-site randomised non-inferiority trial to establish whether a novel online, parent-led cognitive behavior therapy program (OSI; Online Support and Intervention for child anxiety) is as effective as what CAMHS are currently delivering in the COVID-19 context, and whether it brings health-economic benefits. This research has the potential to provide (i) a solution for efficient psychological treatment for child anxiety disorders while social distancing, (ii) an efficient means of treatment delivery to manage the anticipated increase in CAMHS referrals when social distancing measures are relaxed and schools reopen, and will (iii) pave the way for high quality, efficient evaluation and implementation of digital solutions in CAMHS.

It is not clear this is happening. Ongoing work by the MRC-NIHR Trial Methodology Research Partnership (TMRP) Statistics Subgroup on the rigour of global COVID-19 trials has found that only 1 of 9 published COVID-19 trials even mentions ethnicity. Of 1518 COVID-19 studies registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, only six are currently collecting data on ethnicity. The reasons for under-representation of BAME groups are complex and could be attributable to a lack of willingness on the part of participants or a lack of inclusion by health-care staff or researchers and other socioeconomic factors and entrenched structural inequalities. Design decisions such as limiting materials to English means over 40% of Bangladeshi and over 30% of Pakistani women over 65 in the UK cannot take part. Not considering culture, or the nature of the intervention and delivery are likely to exclude more. In 2018 NIHR initiated INCLUDE, which will produce a general roadmap for better inclusion of many under-served groups in trials. In parallel, a collaboration between INCLUDE, Trial Forge and the MRC-NIHR TMRP has been developing the ethnicity component of INCLUDE. The ethnicity framework will help trialists to identify, recruit and retain the BAME representation needed in their trial for the results to be widely applicable to the entire population. There has been substantial BAME and PPI involvement already. This proposal will rapidly complete the INCLUDE Ethnicity Framework and apply it to 3-5 trials (including COVID-19) to produce an example set for other trialists to use when planning future COVID-19 trials. It will also help people interpreting and reporting COVID-19 trials to make judgements about the applicability of trial results to BAME communities.

Methods We will use an ongoing UK Biobank project already designed to investigate ethnic health in UK Biobank, which includes half a million adults, of which there are over 8000 SAs and 8000 BACs. Through this application we have access to linked COVID-19 data, which will include test results, hospitalisation and mortality. Logistic and survival modelling will be used to quantify the risk of SAs and BACs compared to WEs and to investigate possible mediators and effect modifiers. Preparatory work In preparation for this application, we have downloaded over 3000 unique tests results available to date. SAs and BACs were around twice as likely to have confirmed COVID-19 compared to white Europeans, with early evidence that this risk is modified by key markers of health status, including BMI. Conclusion This application is designed to provide greater context to the risk of COVID-19 and resulting complications in BACs and SAs which will help tailor public health policy in the future.

There is growing concern that social distancing and other quarantining meaures introduced by Government will adversely affect general population health and mental health. This proposal aims to understand the nature of the impact of such measures on Scottish people by: i) identifying the key health and mental health concerns and; ii) examining how people’s experiences change over the first 4-months of social distancing.

Since all nursing home residents are at substantial risk, nursing home care staff need to know what residents would want to happen should they become infected with COVID-19. The aim of this project is to develop and evaluate an online advance care planning (ACP) COVID-centric intervention for nursing homes during a COVID-19 outbreak to improve care at the end of life. Findings from a rapid review of available resources will be used to develop an online ACP COVID-centric intervention for training nursing home staff and providing an information resource to family carers. To evaluate the intervention, we will conduct a prospective case study design where a nursing home will be the unit of analysis or ‘case’. Nine nursing homes will participate in the project with three nursing homes located in Northern Ireland, England, and Scotland. We will collect data from up to 54 family carers and 45 nursing home staff. Expected outcomes: (a) enhanced knowledge of conducting end of life discussions during COVID distancing measures; (b) improved ability for staff to assess resident needs and respond more appropriately in relation to ACP; (c) enhanced decision making among family members regarding resident care; (d) improved communication between staff and family carers regarding their relatives health care needs; (e) increased evidence of completed ACPs; (f) development of open source online ACP COVID-centric resources for use by nursing homes.

Using two linked case control studies, we aim to estimate the relative importance of occupational exposures and non-workplace related factors in risk of infection. Additional longitudinal follow-up of the participants will allow us to examine risks among asymptomatic carriers, determine antibody durability and track the pandemic evolution in HCW. We will recruit 5000 HCW from diverse backgrounds and job-roles within three large NHS Trusts in West Midlands. Participants will include HCW with COVID-19 symptoms and have had PCR tests, as well as 1000 of those without symptoms. Cases are HCW with positive PCR results and controls will be a matched sample of those tested negative. We will collect data on personal and health characteristics, type/nature of work, extent and type of interaction with COVID-19 patients, and ability to use recommended infection control procedures. Those with positive tests will be asked about symptoms in household members and the symptomatic ones will be tested for SARS-CoV-2. We will compare occupational and other characteristics by PCR status to examine the relative contribution of occupational and non-workplace risk factors. Participants will be followed up, with blood tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at 3-months and repeated at 6 months. Using interviews with up to 30 purposively selected staff and 20 managers, we will explore access to and use of infection control procedures, to understand any barriers or facilitators.

We have national, daily data on people with COVID-19 and deaths, but there is no similar data for care homes. This makes it difficult to know the scale of the problem, and plan how to keep care home residents safe. We also want to understand the impact of COVID-19 on care home staff and residents. Researchers from University College London (UCL) will measure the number of cases of COVID-19 in care homes, using data from Four Seasons Healthcare, a large care home chain. FSHC remove residents' names and addresses before sending the dataset to UCL, protecting resident's confidentiality. Since we cannot visit care homes during the pandemic, we will hold virtual (online) discussion meetings with care home stakeholders (staff, residents, relatives, General Practice teams) every 6-8 weeks, to learn rapid lessons about managing COVID-19 in care homes and identify pragmatic solutions. Our findings will be shared with FHSC, GPs and Public Health England, patients and the public, and support the national response to COVID-19. Patients and the public will be involved in all stages of the research.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	170819.0 GBP

This COVID-19 Rapid Response award is jointly funded (50:50) between the Medical Research Council and the National Institute for Health Research. The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project. COVID-19 is set to become a global pandemic. Near real time information is needed to inform NHS planning and public health response. This includes community incidence (regardless of seeking care), risk factors for disease, clinical symptoms, case hospitalisation and mortality ratios, asymptomatic viral shedding, asymptomatic infection, household transmission risk and population behaviours during periods of wellness and illness (including social contact and movement, respiratory hygiene and health seeking behaviours). This information can only be gathered accurately through large scale community studies. Our experience of the MRC/Wellcome FluWatch study and ESRC BugWatch study allows us to rapidly establish two six-month national household cohorts (April-September 2020) and (October 2020-March 2021) of 25,000 individuals each (2,500 in each region of England and Wales) for online symptom and behaviour reporting and optional use of an app allowing their mobile phones to be used as GPS trackers enabling secure transfer and analysis of detailed movement patterns. Two sub-cohorts (10,000 individuals each) will also self-swab when ill for detection of COVID-19 and other circulating viruses. We will also conduct a London based study (200 households) following household contacts of COVID-19 cases for 28 days with daily symptom reporting, regular swabbing and baseline and follow up serology to investigate household transmission and asymptomatic infection and virus shedding. We will use data from Virus Watch to train whole population prediction models based on social media and search engine data and develop spatiotemporal models. Findings will be rapidly disseminated via online dashboards informing the public and decision makers.	Medical Research Council	P&Cs	3248052.0 GBP

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project. Efficient response to COVID-19 requires an understanding of the epidemiological and behavioural drivers of disease transmission. Due to the rapidly evolving outbreak and the mitigation strategies likely to be put in place at different times, analyses of epidemic drivers and policy evaluation need constant updating to provide relevant data-driven evidence to inform evolving public health choices. We will provide rapid, continually updated estimates of key epidemiological features such as disease severity and transmissibility measures and lengths of stay. Surveillance, serological and sequence data (where available) will be analysed accounting for censoring and reporting delays. Mathematical models will be fit to the emerging data streams using Bayesian methods to provide regular forecasting updates and assess the impact of current or potential future interventions. Contact and precautionary behaviours will be monitored in a representative cohort along with information on risk awareness and perceived efficacy of interventions to refine transmission models, improve forecasting, and assess the effectiveness of social distancing measures. Special attention will be given to sharing results in an open and timely manner. Epidemiological parameter estimates and forecasts will be shared on a public website, updated daily. User-friendly web interfaces will allow users to generate model outputs and investigate the impact of specific model assumptions on different policy findings. Highlights of essential results will be gathered in short policy briefs updated weekly. Findings will immediately inform UK policy through participation on UK Government advisory committees.

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project. This project aims to rapidly progress a self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vaccine against the 2019 novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) to first in human studies (phase I) within a matter of months. Within 14 days of accessing the sequence we have already designed and constructed a candidate saRNA vaccine expressing a pre-fusion stabilised conformation of the native surface glycoprotein (S-protein). This design maximises the potential for induction of neutralising antibodies while minimising the induction for off-target responses to post-fusion conformations. We have engaged key manufacturing partners able to generate GMP material not only for phase I/II studies according to a very tight schedule but also with the capability to rapidly scale to millions of doses should this be required. This cutting-edge nucleic acid vaccine platform has been specifically designed for rapid manufacture and deployment in the event of an outbreak. SaRNA offers significant advantages over other nucleic acid vaccine platforms yielding exponentially higher levels of protein expression than messenger RNA (mRNA) or DNA. The self-amplifying properties of saRNA mean that much lower doses are required to induce protective immunity, providing a significant advantage to manufacturing costs and speed. Additionally, saRNA is not limited by anti-vector immunity and is safe to administer to individuals unable to receive live attenuated vaccines (e.g. children and the immunocompromised). The Target Product Profile (TPP) is a vaccine that can be rapidly manufactured at low cost and elicit protective immunity across all at risk populations within 6 weeks of administration, with the potential for repeat boosting as required.

The genome of SARS CoV-2 encodes proteins which perform various functions essential for the replication of the virus. By exploiting our knowledge of the 3D structures of these proteins we can identify and/or design small molecules (i.e. drugs) that bind to viral proteins to prevent them from performing their normal function. COVID-19 research groups worldwide been determining 3D structures of proteins encoded within the viral genome. The focus has been on high-profile target proteins of Cov-2, including the protease, spike protein and helicases. Perhaps surprisingly, less effort is being directed towards other promising targets for which there is structural information. We focus on two underexplored proteins, NSP9 (involved in RNA processing) and E protein (a viroporin). NSP9 helps the virus to replicate its genome. By identifying a compound that binds to NSP9, we would have a potential drug to halt viral replication in infected cells. E protein is a viroporin, forming channels in infected cell and viral membranes. Molecules which 'plug' the channel ("channel blockers") are potential anti-viral drugs. For target proteins, we will combine advanced molecular simulations in Oxford with AI-driven identification of potential compounds by IBM to enable and accelerate identification of compounds which could be repurposed as candidate anti-viral drugs. The IBM generative AI method has already been successful in identifying new antimicrobials that have since been experimentally validated. The work here will be undertaken as part of a long-standing collaboration between Oxford and IBM and the strong relationship will ensure delivery of this highly collaborative effort.

Decisions may concern hospital admission or whether to receive care at home, social distancing, and which treatments the person may or may not wish to receive. This can include very difficult decisions such as whether the person wishes to be resuscitated or have other potentially traumatic treatments. These decisions will have an impact on the emotional wellbeing of both the family and person with dementia. Aim: We will produce an evidence-based decision tool to support family carers and people with dementia to make these difficult decisions during COVID-19. Methods: This project will consist of three phases: 1) We will identify key factors influencing the choice of place of death in older people, conducting a rapid review of the evidence; 2) We will review and analyse common challenges and decisions family carers of people with dementia are making in relation to COVID-19, from the Alzheimer's Society online community forum. We will also explore concerns of people living with dementia during COVID-19 reported on the forum and; 3) Together with people living with dementia, family carers and health care professionals, we will develop a decision tool for family carers and people with dementia to use when making difficult decisions. Dissemination and Impact: The tool will provide carers with a clear framework to help them to make decisions and ease feelings of guilt, burden, stress, strain and anxiety. We will work closely with Marie Curie Charity, Alzheimer's Society and British Geriatrics Society to disseminate the tool and our findings to the people who may benefit from using them.

Since the outbreak, these adverse working conditions have been exacerbated. BAME staff experience increased exposure to these workplace adversities, placement in more vulnerable positions, and disempowerment from complaining about deleterious working conditions. These ethnic disparities need to be addressed if we are to avoid the social, economic, and moral costs of excessive adverse mental health and occupational outcomes for BAME staff. Using a mixed methods approach, this study aims to identify ethnic inequalities in mental health and occupational outcomes amongst NHS staff in the context of COVID-19. We will incorporate an ethnicity module into the on-going NHS CHECK study (a national longitudinal study of NHS staff (www.nhscheck.org)). NHS CHECK data will be analysed to assess health and work outcomes of NHS staff within and across Trusts over an 18-month period. Additionally, interviews will be conducted with i) participants of the CHECK survey, ii) London healthcare practitioners (HCPs, e.g., nurses and healthcare assistants) who were interviewed as part of the Tackling Inequalities and Discrimination Experiences (TIDES) study before COVID-19, and iii) NHS managers and senior staff nationally. Findings will be used to develop education and training materials to support BAME NHS staff nationally through collaboration with psychologists (KCL Virtual Reality (VR) Lab), medical educators (e.g., Maudsley Learning) and equality and diversity professionals (Challenge Consultancy).

The survey will include core content, repeated monthly to track changes, and variable content for which Understanding Society has published an open call for researchers across the UK to propose additional questions. The first wave of the COVID-19 qustionniare covers: Coronavirus symptoms and test results; management of long-term health conditions; caring responsibilities; loneliness; employment and financial situation; home schooling; food and alcohol consumption; exercise and smoking; and mental wellbeing.

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project. ChAdOx1 is a replication-deficient simian adenoviral vector that provides a platform technology for the production of vaccines against many infectious diseases. For Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, a single dose of the ChAdOx1-vectored MERS vaccine resulted in protection against MERS challenge in non-human primates and the induction of strong humoral and T cell responses in a Phase I clinical trial. The same vaccine design has now been followed to produce ChAdOx1 nCoV. Preclinical studies of the vaccine will be initiated by the end of February. This will include demonstration of vaccine immunogenicity (antibody and T cell) in mice, followed by vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy against nCoV-19 challenge in ferrets and non-human primates with collaborators at PHE Porton Down and NIH. A pre-GMP vaccine seed stock is in production at Oxford’s GMP manufacturing facility, and will be provided to Advent, Italy, which will produce the first 1000 doses for clinical studies. In parallel with preclinical studies and vaccine manufacturing, Oxford will work with the MHRA on a rapid release testing package. This will employ deep sequencing of the Cell Harvest and Drug Substance to identify any potential replication competent adenovirus and adventitious agents rather than following the existing set of in vivo and in vitro assays, greatly reducing the time to cGMP certification. A phase I/II clinical trial will then be undertaken to demonstrate vaccine safety and immunogenicity in adults, older adults and children.	Medical Research Council	P&Cs	2174847.0 GBP

How the virus causes lung injury is not understood and no treatments exist. It is therefore urgent and vital that the effects of severe COVID-19 are described to rapidly inform clinical management and identify new treatments. Hospital post-mortems of those dying from COVID-19 will allow examination in a level of detail that is not possible during life. This approach will reveal crucial information on the presence of the coronavirus in multiple organs in the body and also understand how the immune system responds. This will rapidly answer key clinical questions and develop a resource of stored tissue that will support international-level COVID-19 research.	Chief Scientist Office	Research Grant	160000.0 GBP

Objective 2-a: To test if Scurfy T cells and WT Foxp3 T cells show any difference in cell cycle and/or apoptosis upon antigen recognition in vivo. 2. Objective 2-b: To assess the role of Foxp3 protein in activation-induced cell death in vivo. Proposed project: The part of the project can be effectively converted into an important study on T-cell immunity to COVID-19. T-cell immunity is considered to play key roles in the eradication of infection by promoting B-cell maturation and eliciting cytotoxic activities to the virus. It is also known that severe COVID-19 patients show remarkable T-cell dysregulation. However, it is unknown known how T-cells respond to each of the key COVID-19 viral antigens, and there is still an urgent need for basic research on the antiviral T-cell immunity using animal models. Accordingly, I propose to investigate T-cell responses to the key COVID viral antigens (including Spike protein) using our mouse models. Specifically we will test if each of the viral proteins induces a particular type of T-cell responses (e.g. Th1 response, Treg induction). We will analyse not only regulatory T-cell (Treg) responses but also helper T-cell responses and CD8+ T-cell responses to the antigen. We will produce recombinant proteins and perform DNA vaccination to analyse T-cell responses. Nr4a3-Tocky and Foxp3-Tocky, which allow the analysis of antigen-reactive T-cells and Treg dynamics, respectively. The level of urgency and importance The proposed project will produce basic materials and knowledge for (1) improving vaccine strategies by enhancing T-cell immunity; (2) improving the COVID-19 immunity test. The fund by converting the two original activities into the COVID-19 research will be equivalent to a 6-month project. We will apply for a follow-on fund through the UKRI and/or industrial grants, in order to further investigate anti-COVID-19 T-cell immunity and develop new methods for fighting COVID-19. The necessary critical mass: The proposed project will be still within the scope of the original plans, i.e. to investigate the mechanism of the generation and functional maturation of Treg in vivo. Instead of using other antigen models, we will use the viral antigens. Thus, we have all the resources including the key transgenic mouse tools (Foxp3-Tocky and Nr4a3-Tocky mice) for the investigation. We will use a commercial maintenance service and their technical supports for maintaining and obtaining the Tocky mice for experiments, in order to smoothly conduct the planned experiments. Strengths: The proposed project will provide key preliminary data for further developing new methods to improve COVID-19 vaccines and immunity tests.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	None

The first case of infection in the UK was reported on 31st January 2020 and with cases continuing to rise, the country was put into lockdown on 23rd March in an effort to reduce the spread of disease.Throughout the epidemic in the UK, mathematical models (including predictions from Warwick) have been used to provide support to the government and to guide decision making. However, these models are typically required to repeatedly produce new outputs as more data emerges on a daily basis on cases and deaths, and there is a need to investigate how the predictions are likely to change as more data become available.This project will develop methodology that will allow for robust parameter inference of the Warwick model, which is already being used for UK-decision support. We will enhance our real time model fitting, incorporating up to date information on cases and outcomes, and use this framework to determine multi-phase adaptive control policies, with a focus upon optimal timing of relaxation and tightening of social distancing measures, that should be implemented to mitigate future infection waves. Our results will be communicated directly to the scientific pandemic influenza modelling group that advises the UK government.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	220403.0 GBP

This project is intended to provide the evidence base for environmental infection control to help control transmission in the healthcare and other environments. The following questions will be addressed Does SARS-CoV-2 survive in the aerosol state in a range of environmental conditions and for how long? Can SARS-CoV-2 survive on a range of environmental surfaces found in healthcare facilities and domestic premises and for how long? Are commonly used room decontamination systems effective at inactivating SARS-CoV-2? Are commonly used air sampling techniques capable of effectively sampling SARS-CoV-2 for subsequent analysis by PCR and plaque assay? All these questions will be addressed using fully developed published methodologies currently available at PHE Porton Down allowing the questions to be answered rapidly.

The new coronavirus disease that emerged in 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a pathogen termed SARS-CoV-2. To develop a rapid and effective therapy against infection, we are proposing to develop an ovine immunoglobulin treatment against the spike protein of this virus. Binding of antibodies to this protein will neutralise cell entry and prevent it's infectivity. Use of ovine immunoglobulin therapy is widespread for other applications, and a therapy rapidly developed for Ebola virus disease (termed EBOTAb) which demonstrated protection in guinea pigs and non-human primates. The use of polyclonal sera recognising muitiple epitopes eliminates risks of escape mutations occuring and eliminating the effectiveness of antibody therapy. This approach is also rapid, cost-effective and has a proven path to regulatory approval. To develop this therapy, recombinant spike protein will be produced in a mammalian expression system to ensure relevant protein folding and confirmation. A large batch will be produced for immunisation of sheep. Immunisations will be conducted using a facility in Australia, to mitigate risks associated with BSE. Sera will be sent to PHE for assessment of antibody levels and once sufficient antibody levels are achieved, plasmapheresis sampling will be undertaken. Immunoglobulin from these samples will be purified to develop the therapeutic material. This will be characterised at PHE for binding and functional properties before being testing using a susceptible animal model for protection against infection and disease progression.

Only two (Kavanagh 2020; McCloskey et al. 2020); discuss (but do not report research on) wider governance issues. Yet the Chinese Communist Party leadership’s response to the epidemic has been comprehensive well beyond clinical management. It has set up high level coordinating mechanisms across government ministries that have issued hundreds of policy documents setting out containment measures. In this way it has mobilized Party and government organizations across (for example) social care, transport, and policing that reach through local governments into every work place and community. It has used TV, print and social media to communicate measures with the public, while the public have used social media as well as self-organization to respond to measures whether by complaining and criticizing or by supporting and complementing government measures. This project will: systematically compile a database of policy documents (available from Chinese government websites) that set out containment measures as they are evolving through the epidemic; use text and computational analysis of newspapers and social media databases (Weibo Scope and WeChat Scope) we will purchase; and conduct local fieldwork (qualitative interviews) to analyse the societal impacts in urban and rural areas and responses on social media and (focussing on companies, and NGOs and citizens) in four carefully chosen localities (Hubei, Beijing, Guangdong and Anhui).

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project. The further spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 outside China, causing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) globally has led to an outbreak that WHO announced 12 March 2020 as a pandemic. The role of Healthcare Workers (HCWs) in managing the outbreak is critical, while working in a setting where they may be inadvertently exposed to SARS-CoV-2, and WHO has prioritised research on how best to protect them from infection and disease. The similar “Public Health Emergencies of International Concern” caused by Zika and Ebola highlighted another important aspect: the need to integrate social sciences research into the outbreak response and to address ethical questions around studies and data sharing, in this context involving HCWs. With our proposal, we aim to integrate three key priorities in a unique way. We will leverage existing funding and our experience within the ICONIC study, funded by the Wellcome Trust/DoH (2014-18). We propose an in-depth analysis of risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs including longitudinal sampling, tracking of movement and studies of behaviours and influences on them (capability, opportunity and motivation). We will perform a virological analysis of infected patients with serial samples to construct a detailed analysis of transmission clusters. The latter will provide valuable clinical data on virus shedding. Finally, we propose to address the ethical questions around the use of apps and wearables, data sharing and conducting studies during an outbreak to produce a set of definitive recommendations for policy makers.

Therapeutics and vaccines are urgently needed. The normal pace of new drug development is incompatible with strategies to rapidly combat COVID-19. Drug combinations with antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity will likely be essential to treat infected patients, as acute respiratory virus-induced disease is commonly mediated by inflammatory responses to infection. An alternative strategy to rapidly identify therapeutics to combat SARS-CoV-2 is drug repurposing. As the drugs are already FDA-approved, it is cost-effective and time-efficient. To this end, we will exploit MuSIC (multiplex screening of interacting compounds) screening of a unique library consisting of ~1,000 drugs to identify single and synergistic interacting compounds that have either SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity or anti-inflammatory activities, with limited/no toxicities. This library includes FDA-approved compounds and antiviral drugs that showed activity against other cornoviruses (SARS-CoV & MERS-CoV) (1). Drug candidates will be validated using SARS-CoV-2-infection of well-differentiated primary human airway epithelial cell cultures (WD-PAECs), which are excellent surrogates of human airway epithelium. WD-PAECs represent the most relevant pre-clinical translational model for screening therapeutic drugs for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 uses that same receptor/entry factors as SARS-CoV (2), which infects WD-PAEC cultures. Our findings will identify candidate drugs for treating COVID-19 patients, which can quickly enter clinical trials or be employed for compassionate use, especially in the case of viral diseases lacking specific treatments.

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project. In preparing for a possible COVID-19 pandemic, estimates of severity, in particular of both the numbers of infections occurring at different levels of severity and the infection- and case-severity risks, are crucial to understand and predict the burden and impact of the epidemic on healthcare services. Such estimates are most importantly needed by age and risk group (e.g. defined by co-morbidities) strata, although in the early stages of an epidemic, strata-specific information is rarely available. No single dataset can provide enough information on its own to estimate severity, but estimation is feasible by synthesising multiple datasets, such as: line-listing data from first few hundred type studies; surveillance data including case counts, numbers accessing healthcare, and numbers of deaths; cohort studies; and household studies. Such a synthesis needs to account for biases inherent in each data source, including differential ascertainment by severity level; and to account for the incomplete nature of the data, which, collected in real time, are typically affected by censoring of final outcomes (recovery/hospital discharge or death). We propose to make the best use of both individual- and aggregate-level data that will become available, by using a combination of survival analysis techniques (e.g. curerate mixture or competing risks models) and Bayesian evidence synthesis in a single analysis to estimate severity in real time, as data accumulate over the course of the epidemic, and once the epidemic is over.

The Company has developed an innovative, customisable antimicrobial coating that has a multitude of applications across industries. The coating is effective against pathogenic bacteria through a contact-killing mechanism. The active agents in these materials are copper compounds and there is strong evidence that copper reduces the viability of the virus strain that causes COVID-19  [DOI: 10.1056/NEJMc2004973 ] We now intend to test the coating against a range of viruses, including the COVID-19 virus. If successful, the coating will be applicable to a wide variety of materials---from wood, to cloth, to metal and steel-- that are located in areas where the public congregates, such as public transport, office buildings, hospitals, gyms, care-homes, supermarkets etc. Such an invention would prove to be invaluable as countries emerge from lockdown by helping to minimize virus transmission through surfaces. Applied as a liquid, the NoBACZ products are adhesive and water repellent and they rapidly form solid but flexible barriers that are robust enough to form semi-permanent coatings on any surface. Lifetime (anticipated to be months) is easily visualised through their distinct colour (deep green) and top up coating can be applied if required. The material is environmentally friendly, comprised from food-chain compatible reagents and manufacturing is straight-forward and easy to scale. The NoBACZ coating product will be investigated to confirm its activity against single strand RNA viruses like the coronavirus. NoBACZ will then iteratively test combinations and consistencies of different formulations in order to zero in on the most durable and widely applicable viricidal version. The target product profile is a coating, visible on any surface, such as a doorknob, a train hand rail, or a supermarket trolley handle, that kills any virus that happens to land on it but is vanilla safe to humans. This would reduce the labour-intensity of decontaminating high-traffic surface areas, ideally allowing cleaning and reapplication to occur only now and again vs the impracticality of several times a day with alcohol / cleaning agents.

Hugely popular comedy festivals including Brighton, Machynlleth, and the biggest arts festival in the world - Edinburgh, have been cancelled, not to mention the nightly comedy variety nights at local clubs all over the country. These events attracted over 3 million people every year. This cancellation of the comedy scene has impacted the lives of the public, comedians, venues and festivals who are suffering not only financially, but also from a dearth of live entertainment and the community that surrounds it. Comedy and laughter is proven to improve well-being and mental health and it is facing a shortage at a time when the general public need it the most. NextUp are creating a Virtual Comedy Festival that re-connects the public with live comedy and the talented acts who create it, allowing them to earn revenue in the process. Our aim is to bring laughter back into the nation's homes, and gain an audience of over a million through our month long festival. Not only does this project amplify the power of comedy during the UK's lockdown, it lays the foundations for live comedy to _continue_ to reach more people than ever including those with physical disability, those facing social isolation, and those who are limited by their geographic or financial circumstances.

The solution will be built as a virtualised platform allowing it to be easily hosted locally or in a secure cloud environment. Contact tracing is an essential part of infection management and by associating personnel, vehicles, equipment and client location, Integrated Community Care management teams can quickly determine what the service exposure is if a team member subsequently becomes infected or must self-isolate as a precaution. The data provided by the solution will enable rapid identification of other personnel, clients, vehicles and equipment that were in proximity through contact association during the specified infectious period. Being able to rapidly identify personnel at risk will enable tighter infection control and reduce the numbers of personnel having to self-isolate, keeping community services up and running during COVID-19 and helping to contain the spread of the virus. Post-pandemic, the same solution will help Integrated Care Teams drive efficiency in their community operations, ensuring compliance, reducing risk, improving personnel utilisation and reducing service costs by providing automatic notifications to delivery teams about delivery readiness, helping to eliminate repeat visits to client homes. The project can be delivered within the current COVID-19 restrictions and within the specified project timelines. The company can commence work earlier, within one week of award, to enable a working prototype to be delivered for service trialling before the next wave of the pandemic.

These issues have become more pressing because of Covid-19 . Virtual clinics are now the only way of interaction between specialists and patients. Limiting travel for vulnerable patients will remain important for some time, yet no suitable system is in place for rare disease specialists to access patients' detailed technical clinical data digitally for a virtual appointment. The current working processes are based around in-person clinics, which vulnerable, sight-impaired patients must travel to attend, often over long distances. Clinicians depend on patients bringing with them data from other appointments (that may have occurred many years ago) and which the patient is expected to have collected and curated at the time. It is worth noting that NHS internal efforts to link and distribute this data have failed, due to the logistics of patient consent. MyEyeSite aims to resolve this issue by empowering patients, through their rights under GDPR, to request, access, collect, manage and share their clinical data as they wish, digitally. MyEyeSite will provide tools for patients to do this in a safe, structured and systematic way. It will also provide an interface for doctors to safely access shared data, for example ahead of a virtual appointment. In due course MyEyeSite will provide interfaces for medical research studies to access data - with appropriate patient consent - to accelerate discovery. The first phase of MyEyeSite was a feasibility study and prototype funded by Health Data Research UK to research the problem space, design and test potential solutions, and carry out a market study. We engaged patients, doctors and researchers as collaborators, carried out extensive user research and collaborative design sprints, held public patient days to garner wider input into work in progress, and engaged industry to explore long term sustainability options. For the second phase we now want to fast track elements of the MyEyeSite R&D programme that will respond to critical issues stemming from Covid-19, by progressing the patient and clinician interfaces from prototype to live production use. In doing so we aim to enable clinicians to provide a better quality of care to this vulnerable group during the pandemic, and also progress an important long term innovation for UK rare disease capability.

154	FOUR D RUBBER COMPANY LIMITED	FOUR D RUBBER COMPANY LIMITED	None	None	None	Reusable Protective Material	This project is to develop UK manufactured reusable sterile polymer material for use in protective equipment including aprons, gowns, surgical drapes, bed and trolley drapes and mask headbands and diaphragms. The Covid-19 outbreak has highlighted the opportunity to improve the approach to protective equipment and materials used in the UK healthcare and other sectors. Current PPE and protective materials are largely single use plastic products sourced from geographically remote locations with long supply chains and competitive demands. The result has been significant challenges to obtain large quantities of protective equipment over a prolonged period of time with associated environmental impacts from shipping and disposal. The superior physical properties of the material will enable it to be resterilised and reused. This will reduce the total volume of protective equipment required to service the needs of the UK's and other countries health services. Reuse of equipment, coupled with UK manufacture, will result in waste and total carbon footprint should reducing significantly in line with the Government's aim to be carbon neutral and to have zero avoidable waste by 2050 . At the same time a strategic source of material in the UK will be developed underpinning a unique manufacturing facility located within a coalfield regenerated area.

155	SME HCI LIMITED	SME HCI LIMITED	None	None	None	Innovative Care Pathway for Employee Mental Health Support	The impact of mental health problems on the UK economy is estimated to be up to £70 billion each year. Because of this need, around 72% of employers now utilise data driven health and wellbeing strategies. This impact is due to the endemic mental health problems within society. The current COVID-19 crisis will result in a significant increase in these costs as the impact of traumatic experiences are felt by individuals and therefore there is an increasing need to address these problems. Current treatment pathways are slow, requiring multiple points of contact before individuals are directed to the care they need. We propose the development of an innovative automated care pathway to enable the rapid assessment of mental health needs relating to COVID-19 traumas and a direct connection to care providers. By building onto our existing software platform, we can enable direct video conferencing between individuals and trauma treatment specialists using our existing data analytic techniques to evaluate and refine a care pathway to ensure the accurate assessment of individuals in need. To our knowledge no platform with this capability exists on the market today. Since 2005 Vivup has been a supplier of EAPs to the public and private sector, including existing implementations within different NHS trusts. We offer support for mental healthcare within the workplace, using a data driven approach to develop effective care pathways for individuals requiring assistance. During the current COVID-19 crisis individuals, in particular frontline healthcare workers, are under incredible strain from their current traumatic workplace conditions. We have already seen an increase in the 10% uptake of the clinical services we provide in March 2020 alone. By developing an innovative automated care pathway to rapidly direct individuals to the mental health treatments they need, we can minimise the effect of Trauma on frontline NHS staff, keeping them at work and improving services at the point-of-care.

156	CLOUD COVER IT SERVICES LTD	CLOUD COVER IT SERVICES LTD	None	None	None	Design of a new lighter VPN client for Home working	**Existing VPN solutions are relatively difficult to administer and difficult to scale. Limitations imposed by older encryption methods leads to poor user experience and limit the number of users each device can support. Traditional full-tunnel VPN architectures also impose high bandwidth requirements on hub sites that many SME struggle to meet.** Our solution will provide an SME friendly, simple to use, easy to deploy, scalable and secure remote access solution to allow access to both local and cloud-based resources without the capacity & bandwidth limitations of traditional VPN systems. With a focus on performance and ease of management, this solution is intended to address many of the challenges currently faced when deploying remote access solutions at speed & scale. Business IT teams have a major challenge in providing a secure connection to company systems against the backdrop of the enormous growth of home working. This system will provide a solution that companies can self manage using existing systems more efficiently and securely. This is a significant advance on existing solutions because it brings remote working technology previously too costly and complex within the reach of the SME sector. The CloudCoverIT team has developed hundreds of specific solutions of this type over nearly a decade in business. And our experienced in house team have scoped the technical elements of this project in 2019 . The current COVID-19 situation has brought the project to the forefront and the team have a project plan ready to develop including technical and commercial development in an 8-week window. The market need for this is significant as all businesses follow government advice to enables all worked who can to work from home. Every business that has staff connecting to systems can do so more securely that without VPN and faster and more reliably than with a stretched VPN operating near or beyond its limit of connections. This system enables companies to make secure connections without large numbers of terminations and high bandwidth by employing modern encryption and compression technology to improve the overall efficiency of the system.

157	YOURMEDPACK LIMITED	YOURMEDPACK LIMITED	None	None	None	Using YOURmeds to help isolated and vulnerable people in the community to medicate effectively	Approximately half of all adults in the UK take prescription medication, but only half take this medication correctly in terms of timing and dose. Many elderly and vulnerable people (e.g. those with mental health issues) require additional support to ensure that they take medicines correctly, with many of those over 75 on multiple drugs for long term health issues. This support is often given as part of any care visits or as a specialised medication visit. Taking medication correctly is key to good health and independence and important now more than ever as we aim to reduce burdens on the NHS. Within the current Covid-19 pandemic, it is important that we shield those most at risk from poor health outcomes whilst maintaining their support network and protecting the health and safety of carers and the wider support network. Therefore, it is not always possible to offer the same level of in-person care or family support visits and maintain everyone's safety. We will pilot our patient centred medication support solution, YOURMeds. YOURMeds is a pre-packed smart medication pack and electronic tag that alerts the user to take their medication and notifies their nominated support network including formal carers and family to any instances when medicines are taken incorrectly (e.g. wrong, missed or overdosed). This digital solution works remotely, transmitting data to the YOURMeds dashboard (accessible via an app for support networks) using the same technology as a mobile phone. Therefore no separate internet connection is required. We will work with a GP group and care agency to recruit participants to our planned pilot and test our solution for a period of 10 weeks with each participant. Our solution will help patients feel supported and maintain their good health and independence in a period where they may not be able to access their usual service or have the support of their wider networks and family. In the longer term, there is scope for YOURMeds to save time and money for councils and other agencies providing adult social care whilst also minimising hospital admissions. This would create additional capacity in the care system and bring more vulnerable people into the safety net.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	46555.0 GBP
158	THE LIGHTERMEN COMPANY LTD	THE LIGHTERMEN COMPANY LTD	None	None	None	Hand-Hygiene Enforcing Access Control	Our project is a 'smart' hand-sanitiser that enforces its use to gain access to a building or space within a building. There is a huge focus on hand-hygiene due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but of course, that concern has always been present in the medical industry. Everybody who has visited a hospital has seen and used the hand-sanitiser dispensers, but may not have understood the upmost importance these bottles on the wall serve. The staff within hospitals across the globe often have their usage of hand-sanitiser tracked and measured in an effort to move usage towards 100%. This is due to the effectiveness of hand-sanitiser usage on stopping the spread of infection between patients; however there is a break in the chain. Visitors to the building are not tracked in any way, and although staff may be tracked, there is nothing enforcing the usage of the hand-sanitiser. This is what our solution addresses. Our system works simply - if you use the hand-sanitiser, you can gain access, if you don't use it - you can't. This system can be applied to every part of a building, from the main access, movement throughout the building - such as between wards, and for compartmentalising larger rooms or sections of the building for isolation. This means it doesn't matter who you are, or why you're in a hospital - you will never be able to forgo the usage of hand-sanitiser, and thus will do your part to reduce the spread of infectious diseases.

159	VALKYRIE INDUSTRIES LIMITED	VALKYRIE INDUSTRIES LIMITED	None	None	None	A virtual classroom for remote education	Education has been severely disrupted by the current Covid-19 health crisis, with opportunity for direct student-teacher interaction limited. Current solutions to the problem include the use of corporate teleconferencing tools, which are not entirely appropriate for the task of educating minors. There are numerous privacy issues and it is difficult for teachers to directly interact with students, or to monitor their engagement and progress over the course of a lesson. Valkyrie Industries proposes a virtual classroom, a digital tool enabling teachers to provide interactive remote education. The classroom will mirror it's real world counterpart, providing a familiar environment for continued learning amongst Covid-19 disrupted schoolchildren and university students. It will provide all of the tools expected by teachers in a real teaching environment, and enable students to join using devices ranging from mobile and smart tv to VR-ready computers. Building on our expertise in natural, embodied interaction and years of developing virtual environments, Valkyrie Industries are creating a ubiquitous tool appropriate for teaching remotely. In the short-term, this would hugely benefit students whose education is currently on hold with fragmented government oversight on remote learning solutions. In the long-term it would provide a teaching resource that leverages the full potential of virtual learning, enhancing classrooms by offering students and distance learners access to group lessons anytime and anywhere. It can boost engagement, immersing teachers and students in new experiences and defying physical limitations with virtual trips into space, inside a virtual human body or exploring atoms. Ultimately, it could also leverage Valkyrie Industries' patented haptic technology to touch and feel the virtual, such as handling moon rocks, for a truly immersive learning experience. However, for the scope of this project we are focussing on the major issues of specificity and security that curtail the use of current available teleconferencing tools. Our virtual classroom will mirror the performance of a real classroom, enabling teachers to hold their own unique classes or full VR lectures. Virtual environments and objects help to simulate a classroom environment, improving learning retention and class interaction. Teachers will be able to gauge student engagement and to test their progression through mini quizzes, questions and built in monitoring. The simple act of looking at a student in a classroom improves how they will respond to the teacher; it is this embodiment that we intend to simulate.

163	SMARTIFY CIC	SMARTIFY CIC	None	None	None	Visit Virtually: Scalable content creation for museums and culture	**Context**: The UK's estimated 2,500 museums have all had to close due to COVID-19 . For the average museum, over 75-80% of annual revenue comes from visitors stepping through their doors (NEMO survey 2020) and with spring and summer peak time for tourism, a cultural financial crisis looms. Museums will also likely see a drop in donations and government support as funding is redirected. Meanwhile, many museum staff have been furloughed or laid off and a recent sector review by Artnet estimated at least 20% of museums globally may not survive the COVID-19 crisis. **Opportunity**: Museums are now looking for new ways to engage their audiences, support wellbeing and generate donations. Over the past decade museums have made huge strides in digitising collections and 60% of museums are increasing their digital reach (Artnet 2020). However, business models which leverage these assets are not yet established and many digital collections go unused. The tools needed to put these assets to good use in generating engagement and revenue are either prohibitively expensive or are part of oversaturated platforms. Museums currently rely on social media or Google Arts and Culture to create and share content. These platforms have clear failings: 1) User experience is poor; clicking around an exhibition with Street View is a frustrating interface and results in 'serious tradeoffs in how the art _and_ the building are communicated' (FRAME, April 2020). 2) They are competitive , saturated and promote paid content. 3) They lack appropriate tools to export media without platform branded logos. 4) Copyright images shared become public domain and museums are unable to develop bespoke rights agreements. 5) The time and effort needed is beyond staff capacity: 'facilitating access... cannot be delivered at the detriment of the sector's already stretched workforce' (Museums and Heritage, 2020). **innovation**: With over 1 million users Smartify is the world's most downloaded museum app and has seen a 30% user increase in engagement since March 2020 . Smartify will build a smart multimedia tour authoring tool that is semi-automated and repurposes existing museum assets. This will include text-to-voice; transcription; translation; predictive content generation, editing and publishing. The tool will enable museums to create, develop and disseminate content, and will analyse online audiences for conversion into membership or donation. It will also create an opportunity to retrain furloughed staff; and will offer distance learning opportunity and alleviation of boredom for audiences at home.

164	PERSEPTIVE LIMITED	PERSEPTIVE LIMITED	None	None	None	AirShield: Virtual 'Air Curtain' to protect against COVID-19 transmission from patients to healthworkers in hospital ICUs	The current coronavirus pandemic has highlighted how hospital in-patients with respiratory infections can spread disease to staff and other patients. Medical staff comprise 10% of coronavirus cases in Italy and early signs indicate that UK medical staff will also be disproportionately affected. Patients with contagious infections (e.g. Measles, SARS, TB) are normally isolated in negative pressure rooms, but in epidemic and low resource settings, this is impossible. Learning from the SARS epidemic of 2003, some countries have put all intensive care beds in negative pressure rooms, but in the UK almost all of these beds are still on open wards. AirShield solves this problem, allowing virtual isolation of the patient in intensive care (or hospital ward), whilst maintaining easy access to the patient from all sides of the bed. This is managed by adapting laminar airflow technology widely used in laboratories to maintain sterile work areas to the clinical environment and retrofitting to hospital beds. The air will be filtered of any exhaled droplets/aerosols so a wall of clean air surrounds the patient. Risks of infection spread to staff and other patients (and subsequent sickness and potential deaths), are significantly reduced. The system is simple to implement, cost-effective and easily scaled, enabling expansion of isolation beds as existing hospital facilities are overwhelmed, and has wider application for other infectious diseases globally, especially in low resource environments.

165	I5 HEALTH LIMITED	I5 HEALTH LIMITED	None	None	None	i5 Coronavirus Health Risk Calculator - Major Upgrade	i5 Health, on a 'pro bono' basis, has recently created the i5 Coronavirus Health Risk Calculator ("Calculator") accessible from [https://www.coronavirusrisk.org/][0]. It establishes whether a person falls into one of four health risk categories: Low, Medium, High and Very High. The i5 Calculator has already been used over 100,000 times and, on 9th April, the largest NHS Commissioning Support Unit for London, NEL CSU, successfully used the tool for 4.1 million Londoners. The uses of the Calculator are many. These include individuals deciding their level of quarantine, the prioritising of care, improvement in bed management particularly in the ICU context, supporting remote consultations, planning for disease control and relaxation of restrictions. With the prospect of Covid-19 wave extending, another wave following and re-occurrences happening each year, there is the additional need for authorities to source information on risk levels of individuals in every location to execute disease control and Social Isolation strategies. To fulfil better all these needs, the Calculator requires rapid upgrading. The opportunity for so doing lies in the fact that that Covid-19 is a previously unheard of strain of Coronavirus - the characteristics of which are only really now being understood. Research behind the creation of the current Calculator had to rely on hospital secondary care data on two close relatives of the new disease - 'human' Coronavirus and Influenza. The data arising from hospital admitted Covid-19 patients will be released before the end of April 2020 and we must be prepared to analyse it for additional insights in order to ensure adjustments to the Calculator's algorithms as quickly as possible, to stratify and protect the population. For the next iteration, we can, with the co-operation of the NHS, draw on additional GP primary care data about the patients. In addition, we can use the time and resources allotted to ensure the linking of outcomes for the High and Very High categories to providing forecasts on key factors like lengths of stay, bed days and ICU needs.

167	CROPDESK TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED	CROPDESK TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED	None	None	None	Development of digital recruitment tool to match UK unemployed to farms experiencing labour shortage as a result of Covid 19	**Specific need:** T**he UK farming industry requires up to 90,000 seasonal workers** at peak, to grow and harvest its crops. The labour to grow our crops has, for the last 30 years, traditionally come from Eastern Europe, as seasonal migrant workers. COVID-19 restrictions on movement of people and global lockdown of transport infrastructure currently prevents them from returning. At the same time, claims for Universal Credit in the UK surged to 950,000 since the -COVID-19 lockdown. The UK is suffering job losses on a scale and speed un-precedented even after a global financial collapse. It is expected that the unemployment rate will rise from 3.9% pre pandemic to 5.2% in April, further in May and June. There is a significant potential UK workforce, likely to want to engage to resolve this key worker crisis. Providing the infrastructure needed to connect farmers with this resource is a sector priority. **innovation:** A unique mobile recruitment app and cloud application which takes details of applicants, pre-checks them for suitability, and offers them to farm subscribers by matching answers to set questions. Employer selects which worker(s) to offer work to, using redacted data and supplies information on their farm and jobs offered. On acceptance, the worker's full details are passed directly to the employer and their contract begins. The app pushes a periodic satisfaction survey to both employee and employer which acts as a 2-way review. Employers notify the system when a contract ends. **Delivery:** Cropdesk has been operating in the technology market for 5yrs, focussing on technology, with a CEO who is a soft fruit farmer himself of over 30 years. Cropdesk will own the IP to this product but will sub-contract agriculture recruitment specialist, Agri-HR to consult and help commercialise it We have multiple initial routes to market: * Through Agri-HR, A European leader in agricultural recruitment (a Gangmasters Licenced Agency) * Through Cropdesk's customers and contacts including Berry Gardens Ltd, the UK's largest soft fruit cooperative * Through Enterprise Europe Network connections and overseas partners and the Knowledge Transfer Network, with potential sector support through the Knowledge Transfer Network * To applicants through a national social media campaign and potentially the DWP (Department of work and pensions)	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	49845.0 GBP
168	MULTICARE MEDICAL LIMITED	MULTICARE MEDICAL LIMITED	None	None	None	Development of profiling bed for community care use	Multicare Medical Ltd developed an existing community profiling bed design to overcome the unique challenges posed by COVID-19 . The project looked at the design of the bed, and reworked the construction of the bed, incorporating innovative mechanisms that allowed the bed to be folded instead of needing to be disassembled, cutting installation time from 20 minutes to 5 minutes. Not only did this increase capacity by allowing more beds to be installed on a daily basis, but also reduced risk to frontline operatives as they spent less time in patients houses. Furthermore the redesign also meant that installer of the bed could assemble the bed in a safer manner with reduced risk of manual handling injuries. Every component was also examined for ways to make the bed more hygienic and easier to clean with the goal of ensuring that the bed could be cleaned easily and thoroughly, reducing the risk of passing infection from one patient to another. The bed was designed to be built and assembled in the UK to avoid global shortages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Alternative raising and lowering mechanisms were sourced and UK manufacturers engaged to ensure that the NHS and Local Authorities could have the equipment it needs, when they needed it.

169	SPYRAS LTD	SPYRAS LTD	None	None	None	Implementation of Paper-based Sensor into Disposible Masks for Continous Respiratory Monitoring for Telemonitoring	COVID-19 is a respiratory based pandemic. With breathlessness being a vital symptom, there is no quantitative method for monitoring essential workers or the most vulnerable individuals for early symptoms. Using Spyras technology incorporated into face masks, we aim to monitor breathing pattern distress and indicate possible deterioration from COVID-19 . With the predicted production volumes of face masks reaching 10 Billion in 2020 only in China(Lai Lin Thomala, 2020) and the high risk of exposure of the people using these masks to COVID-19 a means to predict possible contagion through respiratory analysis embedded within the mask becomes attractive. The benefits of wearing face mask in the fight against the virus are understood and part of clinical practise to wear, countries like Czech Republic, Morocco, and New York are making masks mandatory for the public. Personal protective equipment is a continuing limited resource. Spyras can integrate its highly accurate paper sensors into 3-ply and FFP2/3 respirator masks with minimal disruption to existing manufacturing practices. Spyras' reusable electronics would be contained within a small module that connects to the disposable mask and sensor. A mobile application would connect to the sensor in the mask providing respiratory analytics. This mobile app would not only gather respiratory data but also work as a symptoms tracker to monitor a cough, breathlessness and temperature when the user inputs qualitative data. Data collected through a remote app can be passed to a secure cloud platform and provide an interactive data dashboard for observation both holistically from a government viewpoint for disease spread per demographics down to a clearly detailed clinical need. With funding from Innovate UK, Spyras will be able to redeploy and develop its platform from monitoring the breathing of individuals in sports and hospitals, to face masks at work or outside and take a more measured approach in their individual health profiles. Spyras can extend app features for post virus support, such as implementation of rehabilitation instruction and measures. This is to reduce the possibility of a 'second wave' of infection when restrictive measures are lifted and to assure individuals with the aftermath of such a global event. Moreover, this would positively impact the recovery of people post COVID-19 . As seen from coronavirus outbreaks of the past such as SARS and MERS there will be a need for rehabilitation post healing not only for patients who have been hospitalised in ICU(Chan 2005).

We make music that matters, and music for change in a wide variety of places, and in particular use music as a therapy through our programme - Music In Mind. Music in Mind is our group music therapy project for people living with dementia and their carers, delivered by specialist music therapists and skilled professional musicians. We are already leading people across the North West of England and around the world through this programme. Since 2012, we have worked with close to 6,000 people living with dementia and our aim to to reach the same again by 2022 . Relationships with The University of Manchester, NHS trusts and national housing associations help us provide ongoing musical interventions for people living with dementia, and bespoke training for healtcare professionals to leave a legacy behind after our projects end. Commissions from the British Council, the UK's international organisation for cultural relations and educational opportunities, have enabled us to share our expertise with professional musicians in Taiwan, Japan and Montenegro. Because of the current Covid-19 lockdown, Manchester Camerata's consultant music therapists and musicians are unable to continue delivering the core Music in Mind programme to people living with dementia across Greater Manchester. Our aim is to build an online platform to enable remote delivery of Music in Mind. This will primarily provide immediate support to people currently affected by the Covid-19 lock down across Greater Manchester. Manchester Camerata will approach a global market with the online Music in Mind Remote training resources and digital music activities.The vision of Music in Mind is truly international as dementia knows no boundaries. Therefore, the training packages that will be developed will be translated into many different languages.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	49911.0 GBP
171	BIRMINGHAM ENTERPRISE COMMUNITY CIC	BIRMINGHAM ENTERPRISE COMMUNITY CIC	None	None	None	Supporting emerging entrepreneurs through uncertainty	COVID-19 has created disruption never before experienced during peacetime. Businesses suspending operations, job losses and lockdowns have resulted in opportunities for young people's careers dropping significantly, with vacancies in many sectors falling 32-40% (Sources: TechCrunch & Adzuna) leading to falling career prospect confidence. The aim for this project is to create a programme of support aimed to provide entrepreneurial training to young adults facing career disruptions due to COVID-19 in order to help them create their own career opportunities or increase chances of employment through upskilling. This virtual programme would offer digital training resources, workshops, mentoring and peer support to help develop individuals over competency areas as set out in the 'EntreComp' Framework whilst allowing them to build a portfolio of evidence. Being part of the peer community will remind individuals that they are not alone as they work together to rebuild confidence in their futures. Those who do not start a venture afterwards return to the workforce with higher skills having developed entrepreneurial competencies, increasing the value they bring to organisations. These entrepreneurial employees bring a source of innovative and creative thinking to organisations and are able to lead them in seeking new business opportunities in a post-COVID world. Those who do launch ventures may create employment for themselves and for others whilst contributing economically, creating impact from the programme. In order to achieve the vision, this project will focus on three objectives: 1. To entrepreneurial upskill 18-30 year olds who have seen their career prospects affected by COVID-19 . 2. To support individuals prepare for new career opportunities including starting a business. 3. To help target individuals to access a network of like-minded individuals to enable support and combat social isolation. The area of focus for this project will be individuals aged 18-30 year olds who have their career prospects affected by COVID-19 . This may include individuals who have lost jobs or been furloughed, individuals who are unemployed or individuals who have just left education and are now seeking employment. The regional focus for this project will be the West Midlands area which has been severely affected by COVID and contained a large number of individuals in this demographic. This project is innovative in the way that it uses entrepreneurial competences to generate an evidenced-based portfolio of professional development applicable to a range of careers, delivered through digital mediums that can be scaled whilst still generating impact and providing value for money.

173	3D REPO LTD	3D REPO LTD	None	None	None	BIM for Remote Working	Despite being one of the main contributors to the UK economy, the majority of construction output has stopped entirely due to the ongoing pandemic. Those projects that are still operational ordered all of their non-essential staff to work from home wherever possible. However, attempting to work on complex architectural and infrastructure 3D designs over the Internet while trying to collaborate with colleagues remotely poses unique challenges not seen in other industries. A major issue experienced by everyone is choppy audio and video while teleconferencing. Adding 3D rendering into the mix makes screen sharing in architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) virtually impossible. Even popular service providers such as Netflix were forced to reduce their streaming resolution in order to free up much needed capacity within the network. We, therefore, aim to devise a new solution for remote working and collaboration specific to AEC. Instead of relying on screen sharing which effectively sends a stream of images over the Internet, our solution will rely on remote 3D rendering and navigation sharing. Each user will be able to instantly become a presenter in 3D space with avatars denoting, in real-time, who is working on what at any given location. This will significantly improve remote working experience for AEC professionals while at the same time speeding up the Internet for the rest of us. This solution is being made open source and free to use for the benefit of the entire construction industry in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	49990.0 GBP
174	IMIN LTD	IMIN LTD	None	None	None	Democratising Livestreamed Fitness: supporting user's health and the leisure industry	In the UK, it has been previously reported that physical inactivity is responsible for one in six of all preventable deaths, with an estimated cost of £7.4bn/year (PHE). COVID-19 is creating fatal health problems that are an immediate and obvious concern; but what cannot be overlooked is that a sustained lockdown period will result in lower rates of wellbeing across society - lower levels of physical health, and deteriorating mental health that come from being isolated and limited in out-of-home pursuits. The leisure sector, together with public health, is on-hand to help fight against the rising tide of inactivity in usual circumstances; but because of new regulations forcing leisure businesses to close and outdoor groups to be banned, overnight we have removed almost all extrinsic support that exists to support people to continue to be physically active. For example, early evidence suggests that the long government struggle against childhood obesity will be exacerbated by the pandemic (Columbia University). Not only that, but leisure business cannot earn revenue using existing routes, and current trends indicate many will not be able to re-open after a lockdown is lifted, meaning we won't have these organisations there to continue to fight against inactivity once society becomes to return to normalcy. Without any intervention, physical activity levels will plummet, and the UK (and the rest of the world) will face the next huge health challenge of widespread, chronic unchecked health issues associated with isolation and physical inactivity. imin, the middleware platform for the leisure sector leaders, will rapidly develop a new API to deliver live information about live-streamed virtual exercise classes to existing and new B2B customers. By working in close collaboration with OpenActive and partners, this will be delivered across a number of local authorities and health bodies, to help those types of organisations to continue to support citizens to stay physically active whilst self-isolating, ensuring mental health and overall wellness is sustained in these most testing of times, as well as supporting fitness businesses to continue to deliver to their target users.

175	I5 HEALTH LIMITED	I5 HEALTH LIMITED	None	None	None	i5 Coronavirus Health Risk Calculator - Major Upgrade	i5 Health, on a 'pro bono' basis, has recently created the i5 Coronavirus Health Risk Calculator ("Calculator") accessible from [https://www.coronavirusrisk.org/][0]. It establishes whether a person falls into one of four health risk categories: Low, Medium, High and Very High. The i5 Calculator has already been used over 100,000 times and, on 9th April, the largest NHS Commissioning Support Unit for London, NEL CSU, successfully used the tool for 4.1 million Londoners. The uses of the Calculator are many. These include individuals deciding their level of quarantine, the prioritising of care, improvement in bed management particularly in the ICU context, supporting remote consultations, planning for disease control and relaxation of restrictions. With the prospect of Covid-19 wave extending, another wave following and re-occurrences happening each year, there is the additional need for authorities to source information on risk levels of individuals in every location to execute disease control and Social Isolation strategies. To fulfil better all these needs, the Calculator requires rapid upgrading. The opportunity for so doing lies in the fact that that Covid-19 is a previously unheard of strain of Coronavirus - the characteristics of which are only really now being understood. Research behind the creation of the current Calculator had to rely on hospital secondary care data on two close relatives of the new disease - 'human' Coronavirus and Influenza. The data arising from hospital admitted Covid-19 patients will be released before the end of April 2020 and we must be prepared to analyse it for additional insights in order to ensure adjustments to the Calculator's algorithms as quickly as possible, to stratify and protect the population. For the next iteration, we can, with the co-operation of the NHS, draw on additional GP primary care data about the patients. In addition, we can use the time and resources allotted to ensure the linking of outcomes for the High and Very High categories to providing forecasts on key factors like lengths of stay, bed days and ICU needs.

177	CROPDESK TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED	CROPDESK TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED	None	None	None	Development of digital recruitment tool to match UK unemployed to farms experiencing labour shortage as a result of Covid 19	**Specific need:** T**he UK farming industry requires up to 90,000 seasonal workers** at peak, to grow and harvest its crops. The labour to grow our crops has, for the last 30 years, traditionally come from Eastern Europe, as seasonal migrant workers. COVID-19 restrictions on movement of people and global lockdown of transport infrastructure currently prevents them from returning. At the same time, claims for Universal Credit in the UK surged to 950,000 since the -COVID-19 lockdown. The UK is suffering job losses on a scale and speed un-precedented even after a global financial collapse. It is expected that the unemployment rate will rise from 3.9% pre pandemic to 5.2% in April, further in May and June. There is a significant potential UK workforce, likely to want to engage to resolve this key worker crisis. Providing the infrastructure needed to connect farmers with this resource is a sector priority. **innovation:** A unique mobile recruitment app and cloud application which takes details of applicants, pre-checks them for suitability, and offers them to farm subscribers by matching answers to set questions. Employer selects which worker(s) to offer work to, using redacted data and supplies information on their farm and jobs offered. On acceptance, the worker's full details are passed directly to the employer and their contract begins. The app pushes a periodic satisfaction survey to both employee and employer which acts as a 2-way review. Employers notify the system when a contract ends. **Delivery:** Cropdesk has been operating in the technology market for 5yrs, focussing on technology, with a CEO who is a soft fruit farmer himself of over 30 years. Cropdesk will own the IP to this product but will sub-contract agriculture recruitment specialist, Agri-HR to consult and help commercialise it We have multiple initial routes to market: * Through Agri-HR, A European leader in agricultural recruitment (a Gangmasters Licenced Agency) * Through Cropdesk's customers and contacts including Berry Gardens Ltd, the UK's largest soft fruit cooperative * Through Enterprise Europe Network connections and overseas partners and the Knowledge Transfer Network, with potential sector support through the Knowledge Transfer Network * To applicants through a national social media campaign and potentially the DWP (Department of work and pensions)	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	49845.0 GBP
178	MULTICARE MEDICAL LIMITED	MULTICARE MEDICAL LIMITED	None	None	None	Development of profiling bed for community care use	Multicare Medical Ltd developed an existing community profiling bed design to overcome the unique challenges posed by COVID-19 . The project looked at the design of the bed, and reworked the construction of the bed, incorporating innovative mechanisms that allowed the bed to be folded instead of needing to be disassembled, cutting installation time from 20 minutes to 5 minutes. Not only did this increase capacity by allowing more beds to be installed on a daily basis, but also reduced risk to frontline operatives as they spent less time in patients houses. Furthermore the redesign also meant that installer of the bed could assemble the bed in a safer manner with reduced risk of manual handling injuries. Every component was also examined for ways to make the bed more hygienic and easier to clean with the goal of ensuring that the bed could be cleaned easily and thoroughly, reducing the risk of passing infection from one patient to another. The bed was designed to be built and assembled in the UK to avoid global shortages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Alternative raising and lowering mechanisms were sourced and UK manufacturers engaged to ensure that the NHS and Local Authorities could have the equipment it needs, when they needed it.

179	SPYRAS LTD	SPYRAS LTD	None	None	None	Implementation of Paper-based Sensor into Disposible Masks for Continous Respiratory Monitoring for Telemonitoring	COVID-19 is a respiratory based pandemic. With breathlessness being a vital symptom, there is no quantitative method for monitoring essential workers or the most vulnerable individuals for early symptoms. Using Spyras technology incorporated into face masks, we aim to monitor breathing pattern distress and indicate possible deterioration from COVID-19 . With the predicted production volumes of face masks reaching 10 Billion in 2020 only in China(Lai Lin Thomala, 2020) and the high risk of exposure of the people using these masks to COVID-19 a means to predict possible contagion through respiratory analysis embedded within the mask becomes attractive. The benefits of wearing face mask in the fight against the virus are understood and part of clinical practise to wear, countries like Czech Republic, Morocco, and New York are making masks mandatory for the public. Personal protective equipment is a continuing limited resource. Spyras can integrate its highly accurate paper sensors into 3-ply and FFP2/3 respirator masks with minimal disruption to existing manufacturing practices. Spyras' reusable electronics would be contained within a small module that connects to the disposable mask and sensor. A mobile application would connect to the sensor in the mask providing respiratory analytics. This mobile app would not only gather respiratory data but also work as a symptoms tracker to monitor a cough, breathlessness and temperature when the user inputs qualitative data. Data collected through a remote app can be passed to a secure cloud platform and provide an interactive data dashboard for observation both holistically from a government viewpoint for disease spread per demographics down to a clearly detailed clinical need. With funding from Innovate UK, Spyras will be able to redeploy and develop its platform from monitoring the breathing of individuals in sports and hospitals, to face masks at work or outside and take a more measured approach in their individual health profiles. Spyras can extend app features for post virus support, such as implementation of rehabilitation instruction and measures. This is to reduce the possibility of a 'second wave' of infection when restrictive measures are lifted and to assure individuals with the aftermath of such a global event. Moreover, this would positively impact the recovery of people post COVID-19 . As seen from coronavirus outbreaks of the past such as SARS and MERS there will be a need for rehabilitation post healing not only for patients who have been hospitalised in ICU(Chan 2005).

We make music that matters, and music for change in a wide variety of places, and in particular use music as a therapy through our programme - Music In Mind. Music in Mind is our group music therapy project for people living with dementia and their carers, delivered by specialist music therapists and skilled professional musicians. We are already leading people across the North West of England and around the world through this programme. Since 2012, we have worked with close to 6,000 people living with dementia and our aim to to reach the same again by 2022 . Relationships with The University of Manchester, NHS trusts and national housing associations help us provide ongoing musical interventions for people living with dementia, and bespoke training for healtcare professionals to leave a legacy behind after our projects end. Commissions from the British Council, the UK's international organisation for cultural relations and educational opportunities, have enabled us to share our expertise with professional musicians in Taiwan, Japan and Montenegro. Because of the current Covid-19 lockdown, Manchester Camerata's consultant music therapists and musicians are unable to continue delivering the core Music in Mind programme to people living with dementia across Greater Manchester. Our aim is to build an online platform to enable remote delivery of Music in Mind. This will primarily provide immediate support to people currently affected by the Covid-19 lock down across Greater Manchester. Manchester Camerata will approach a global market with the online Music in Mind Remote training resources and digital music activities.The vision of Music in Mind is truly international as dementia knows no boundaries. Therefore, the training packages that will be developed will be translated into many different languages.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	49911.0 GBP
181	BIRMINGHAM ENTERPRISE COMMUNITY CIC	BIRMINGHAM ENTERPRISE COMMUNITY CIC	None	None	None	Supporting emerging entrepreneurs through uncertainty	COVID-19 has created disruption never before experienced during peacetime. Businesses suspending operations, job losses and lockdowns have resulted in opportunities for young people's careers dropping significantly, with vacancies in many sectors falling 32-40% (Sources: TechCrunch & Adzuna) leading to falling career prospect confidence. The aim for this project is to create a programme of support aimed to provide entrepreneurial training to young adults facing career disruptions due to COVID-19 in order to help them create their own career opportunities or increase chances of employment through upskilling. This virtual programme would offer digital training resources, workshops, mentoring and peer support to help develop individuals over competency areas as set out in the 'EntreComp' Framework whilst allowing them to build a portfolio of evidence. Being part of the peer community will remind individuals that they are not alone as they work together to rebuild confidence in their futures. Those who do not start a venture afterwards return to the workforce with higher skills having developed entrepreneurial competencies, increasing the value they bring to organisations. These entrepreneurial employees bring a source of innovative and creative thinking to organisations and are able to lead them in seeking new business opportunities in a post-COVID world. Those who do launch ventures may create employment for themselves and for others whilst contributing economically, creating impact from the programme. In order to achieve the vision, this project will focus on three objectives: 1. To entrepreneurial upskill 18-30 year olds who have seen their career prospects affected by COVID-19 . 2. To support individuals prepare for new career opportunities including starting a business. 3. To help target individuals to access a network of like-minded individuals to enable support and combat social isolation. The area of focus for this project will be individuals aged 18-30 year olds who have their career prospects affected by COVID-19 . This may include individuals who have lost jobs or been furloughed, individuals who are unemployed or individuals who have just left education and are now seeking employment. The regional focus for this project will be the West Midlands area which has been severely affected by COVID and contained a large number of individuals in this demographic. This project is innovative in the way that it uses entrepreneurial competences to generate an evidenced-based portfolio of professional development applicable to a range of careers, delivered through digital mediums that can be scaled whilst still generating impact and providing value for money.

185	LEESMAN LIMITED	LEESMAN LIMITED	None	None	None	Leesman Home Working Survey and Analysis	In response to the COVID-19 global outbreak, economists estimate that UK GDP will fall by up to 30%. Forecasting the impacts of such an unprecedented pandemic is near impossible due to the ambiguity around the demise of the virus, and the ability to measure its societal and economic impact is years if not decades off. We are able to measure the impact from an employee / employer perspective. As a result of the country-wide lockdown, organisations have been forced into the world's largest ever home working experiment. What may be common practice for some is an entirely new way of working for the majority. 52% of Leesman's global database of employee workplace experience, comprising of more than 740,000 respondents, have little or no experience working from home in their present roles. When looking at only the UK, this figure increases to 55%. As the world's leading authority on employee experience, Leesman's deployment of a rapid response survey and subsequent academic insight allows the UK to take the lead in understanding the impact of home working on the economy and society. In addition, it will also aid individual organisational exit strategies from lockdown, enabling employers to make data-led decisions on who can return to existing working environments first, based on the measured effectiveness of working from home. _On a micro level, Leesman_ provides a depth of analysis that will show an organisation exactly how its workforce has coped and been supported while working from home, while on a macro level, Leesman's front line empirical data can benchmark this against global statistics relating to workplace effectiveness, experience and productivity. As a nation, the UK has been told it is lagging behind other European countries' productivity levels for years. As we eventually enter the winter of this discontent and move into a united recovery, we will be looking to up these socio-economic levels like never before. By understanding how effective we have been, we are able to look at how effective we can be by benchmarking data from home working against office-based work.

186	LIOPA LTD	LIOPA LTD	None	None	None	Use of automated lip reading to communicate with Tracheostomised Covid-19 patients	The COVID pandemic will result in large numbers of patients who need to be weaned off ventilators over several weeks. In order to do this, patients will need a tracheostomy. From experience with existing patients it is known that these patients will not be sedated, will be in an unfamiliar environment, confused, frightened, weak and unable to vocalise. By utilising AI technology the SRAVI app can lip read and then translate to written or verbalised language on a handheld device - allowing these patients to communicate effectively with carers and relatives. The App, when pointed towards the patient, will capture video of the patient mouthing phrases, decipher 'speech' from the lip movements and vocalise the result. This can be done both at the patient bedside or remotely if they continue to be infectious. This will help mental health, pain relief and early rehabilitation. The project will deliver - * A fully-featured, productised version of SRAVI capable of commercial use in ICUs/General Wards. * A Feasibility study using the SRAVI App in two (or more) ICUs - Usability measures will be built into the app to capture feedback and allow ongoing development and evaluation of the app. A range of outcome measures will be collected from patients, families and staff to inform the healthcare impact and market potential of SRAVI.

It is obfuscating the principle of 'open justice' and our archaic court processes simply aren't able to deliver on their purpose in this new setting. The need for 'information transparency' (visibility over court processes; over data about the throughput and volumes of cases; about the age, gender, or other protected characteristics of the litigants; about the substantive decision, etc) is greater than ever since 'real-time transparency' is not possible. Hearings are taking place between the judge and the parties involved, with little room for scrutiny from reporters or the public. Researchers have indicated that the in-person ethical framework they usually abide by to evaluate the impact of proceedings (getting informed consent, not disrupting proceedings) is not possible in this new setting. And innovators are calling for court data which was never before possible to obtain until now. Our radical idea will address these issues by changing the way we 'observe' proceedings. We are committed to working across the legal sector (commercial, Government, third sector) to create a shared insights roadmap and common schemas. Utilising our speech-to-text software, this project create automated transcripts from recordings, and impose rich structure on this data that can be analysed collectively to analyse trends and garner insights in unprecedented ways.

188	JSF HEALTHCARE LTD	JSF HEALTHCARE LTD	None	None	None	ReBleep - The Redefined medical bleep	Following the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic, the pressure placed upon NHS staff has increased drastically. What was always a stressful and time-crucial organisation, has become even more constrained. At the heart of healthcare, is communication. We communicate with patients; we communicate with their family members; we communicate with our team. Despite the emphasis on communication, there is research to say that 70% of all errors in healthcare are down to poor communication. The current method of communication amongst doctors -- the pager -- is inefficient, expensive and compromises patient well-being; so much so, that the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care has ordered for them to be phased out by the end of 2021 . ReBleep is an application, designed by doctors, to combat the negatives of the pager system and improve communication throughout the NHS. This is an application designed for all healthcare workers - from doctors, to nurses, to phlebotomists. Faster and more efficient communication amongst the healthcare team will mean better healthcare for individuals. Features we include, such as severity-level indication will enable the easy prioritisation of tasks -- a task that doctors have had to manually think through themselves. This will reduce the workload and stress on the NHS. A clear track-record and more certain handover of bleeps will ensure that jobs do not get missed -- an unfortunate scenario that is becoming more likely due to the impact of COVID. As a whole, ReBleep will help alleviate the burnout of NHS staff - a profession where 76% of employees experience mental distress or ill health at work, and up to 57.4% of foundation year 2 doctors decide not to enter further training (2017). Future expansion to GP Surgeries will decrease the separation between primary and secondary care, substantially decreasing the time taken for GPs to write to specialist clinicians for letters of advice. The rapid communication between all members of the NHS will increase the country's scope to deal with future crises, whether it be an unforeseen pandemic, or an unexpected war.

We want to replace all the awful timesheeting applications your business uses, and replace it with something that is made for organisations that have had to embrace remote working quickly and perhaps against their will. But Good Morrow isn't just a really good timesheeting app - it turns the concept on its head. Rather than asking the employee to account for their time, it applies the principles of modern wellness and productivity apps to help employees organise and understand how they are using their time. An employee-centric approach which matches the realities of remote working. Check in with Good Morrow each morning and you'll get an AI-supported conversation asking which items on your to-do you managed, confirming which meetings happened and how they went, and making sure you've taken time for lunch and relaxation. It'll give you tips for how to manage stress, or handle conflicting work demands, based on the data you've provided over time. And at the end of all of this, it will use that information to fill in your timesheets for you, asking you to fill in any gaps. At the end of the work day, you open Good Morrow again to get your to-do list in shape for the morning and close off the day. And your employer gets quality management information, delivered straight to their existing system, which really reflects how their employee's time has been used.

190	OPEN DATACENTRE SERVICES LIMITED	OPEN DATACENTRE SERVICES LIMITED	None	None	None	Testing and Immunisation Certification Project	This project is intended to create a decentralised digital certification and verification mechanism for the current Covid-19 testing and a future immunisation programme, in order to increase UK pandemic preparedness and resilience to any future outbreaks. Adoption of this model will enable UK residents to take control of elements of their own medical history and provide information to selected third parties in a secure manner, without disclosing more confidential medical information. The current Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted a need for UK residents to have greater access to selected parts of their medical history. This will enable patients to grant interested third parties, selective permission to access their records, in order to validate their personal testing and immunisation information. By establishing an effective certification and validation process, clinicians, pharmacists and future testing organisations, can validate and digitally certify, the results of antibody testing and any future immunisation programmes. Selectively accessible certification of testing and immunisation information will enable the population to emerge more rapidly from the current crisis caused by this pandemic. Individuals will be able to return to work, travel, and resume their normal activities and be able to prove they have been either tested or immunised from the current outbreak. Certification also provides a suitable infrastructure for any subsequent pandemics. By introducing a certification programme, individuals will be able to be released from the current lockdown in a more controlled manner. This will have positive effects not just for UK GDP, but in the wider social contexts of mental health, domestic violence and isolation. The inclusion of immunisation certification is crucial. Not only is this relevant to the current situation, but provides the opportunity to include and delegate travel and other regular vaccinations, which can be clearly identified as current or expired. This is an enormous advantage for the travel sector and employers alike. The solution generates a digitally signed certificate that confirms testing results and any immunisation data, by means of QR codes. These QR codes enable access to this information either by means of scanning the code contained in a mobile phone app, or could be printed for those who do not possess a smartphone. This project provides a simple solution for the ongoing testing process, and any future immunisation programme, not just for the current pandemic. Implementing such a solution, not only aids recovery from this pandemic, but increases the UK preparedness for any subsequent outbreaks.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	48733.0 GBP

192	LIBERTINE FPE LIMITED	LIBERTINE FPE LIMITED	None	None	None	Care home BiPAP breathing aid for early stage intervention	A significant number of COVID-related deaths in the UK, EU and worldwide occur in care homes where elderly residents contract the disease but cannot be hospitalised due to a lack of capacity or poor expected clinical outcomes from later stage medical interventions such as invasive ventilation. Recent studies have shown that the application of bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) respiratory support for patients at an early stage of influenza-type respiratory diseases reduces progression to ARDS for a significant proportion of patients. A BiPAP device is similar to a user-operated continuous positive airway pressure device (e.g. a sleep apnea machine) but provides two pressure levels to reduce breathing effort and assist exhalation. The objective of this project is to create a low cost BiPAP device suitable for deployment in UK care homes to reduce mortality due to COVID-19 infections during 2020, and to provide an effective early stage intervention to reduce mortality in subsequent annual flu seasons.

193	LUTTON FARMS LIMITED	LUTTON FARMS LIMITED	None	None	None	Experimental development to develop a hand held blueberry harvesting aid	The UK soft fruit industry is facing unprecedented challenges due to the uncertainty of available picking labour as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, coupled with ongoing limitations caused by the uncertainty of Brexit, the fall in the value of sterling and greater opportunities becoming available to migrant labour in mainland Europe. Given these pressures, it is now critical to develop a harvesting aid to alleviate the pressure on requiring large numbers of migrant workers and improve the industry's resilience to future disruptions. A successful aid will enable the industry to pick all available blueberries and therefore supply the UK population with blueberries which are high in antioxidants and help support the immune system. Whilst also supporting the UK economy, protecting jobs in rural areas and preventing unnecessary imports which are detrimental to the environment. We will use advanced and precision design techniques to rapidly develop a blueberry harvesting aid. We will use 3D CAD modelling, digital prototyping and 3D printing to create the harvesting aid. This project is critical to the immediate sustainability of the blueberry industry.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	49796.0 GBP
194	LYRISTIC LIMITED	LYRISTIC LIMITED	None	None	None	Lost in Song	Throughout history, in times of crisis humans have sung together to keep their spirits up. Lost in Song invites socially isolated people throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to experience a joyful choral immersion through 360 video, with the option of using a cardboard virtual reality visor. Through this accessible web app, participants can sing well-loved songs with one of the UK's leading choirs, Ex Cathedra. The web app tackles loneliness and anxiety for those who need to be isolated for longer periods of time, including the 1.3 million people that Public Health England have identified as in the 'shielded' category. The need for this product is clear. According to the Office of National Statistics on April 16th, 58% of people with underlying health conditions had not left their house in the past 7 days. Almost half of people with underlying conditions reported high levels of anxiety and a quarter of the group had felt lonely. Singing is known to help: many studies have shown that singing reduces anxiety. Singing together is powerful. It stimulates every area of the brain, releases feel-good hormones, reduces stress; it can excite and can calm. It touches our deepest emotions. It transforms individuals into a community. Singing builds confidence, shared understanding and empathy. It teaches us to express ourselves with confidence. 360 video has been proven to be able to elicit a feeling of a person's physical 'presence' -- it can simulate the feeling of being with others. Lost in Song combines the two to create a fun, joyful experience for hundreds of thousands of people. The project will be delivered by UK leaders in cultural virtual reality, Limina Immersive. Limina have brought VR to broader audiences since 2016, making virtual reality accesible for people who probably wouldn't consider themselves 'early adopters'. Our choir partner is the world renowned Ex Cathedra, who have a 20-year track record of working with the NHS to provide patients with the powerful benefits of song. Crucially, the project will draw on the expertise of NHS Arden and Greater East Midlands CSU, who'll also deliver the project evaluation ready for phase two. This first project phase includes testing, refinement, production, marketing, distribution, building the web app and populating it with five 360 singalongs of well-loved songs. Our ultimate objective is to help keep isolated people's spirits up by providing an accessible way for them to experience the joy of group singing.

195	SPHERITECH LIMITED	SPHERITECH LIMITED	None	None	None	A Novel Antiviral Filter for Face Masks	Face masks currently in use by healthcare professionals in the NHS and in social care were not designed to be specifically antiviral. Even worse, the simple cloth and paper disposable masks often used by the general public offer little protection and may even be reservoirs to catch and retain droplets containing viruses. In these unprecedented times when we are faced with the COVID-19 pandemic it is essential that the front-line staff in healthcare are provided with the best possible protection. Spheritech has developed a porous hydrogel, originally designed for wound healing and tissue repair that has in-built antimicrobial properties. This can readily be prepared in the form of a porous filter for face masks. The porous hydrogel is proven to be effective against bacteria and fungi but it does not contain any antiviral components. Sodium dodecyl sulphate and sodium lauryl sulphate are well known to be antiviral and are the antiviral components of hand soaps. Our vision is to incorporate dodecyl sulphate and/or lauryl sulphate into our porous hydrogel to add antiviral properties to help combat the current coronavirus pandemic and future viral epidemics. Spheritech has letters of support from large established company for the large scale manufacture of this novel porous filter and support from a mask manufacturing company who already supply the NHS with masks. The process for manufacture is simple and can be scaled rapidly. The raw materials for the filters are a food preservative, poly-epsilon-lysine and the fatty acid suberic acid, both of which are manufactured on a multi-tonne scale. A unique advantage of using a porous hydrogel is its ability to absorb large amounts of aqueous droplets where the viruses are carried and transmitted. This project will fund the development work required to optimise the loading of the antiviral component into the porous hydrogel. It will also cover the antiviral studies required to assess the filters, which have to be carried out to regulatory standards. During the project the company will also be in continuous discussions with the two companies that can scale up the manufacture of both filters and the masks.

196	OPEN BIONICS LTD	OPEN BIONICS LTD	None	None	None	End-to-end digital service for upper limb amputees and clinicians	Prosthetic Clinics in the UK and abroad have closed during COVID-19 lockdowns. This is frustrating for people with upper limb differences who seek a prosthesis for work or daily living needs, or who were in the process of receiving their awaited device. It is catastrophic for clinics and clinical suppliers who, in response to losses have had to furlough, make redundancies, and pause operations. It is also frustrating for clinicians and OTs who want to see and engage with their patients. Open Bionics proposes a feasibility study with a clinical partner in the UK and with UK upper-limb amputees that trials a new digital workflow. Open Bionics proposes to demonstrate new digital processes and tools that empower clinicians and enables them to continue aspects of their work interrupted by clinic closures. This proposal affects upper-limb amputees, clinics, clinicians, and suppliers. Open Bionics will build upon early lab R&D to take this new digital pathway into the field with patients and clinicians.

197	SHOAL COMMUNITY LTD	SHOAL COMMUNITY LTD	None	None	None	Supporting safe return-to-work and the future resilience of of cities, companies and workers post-lockdown by leveraging our existing network of thousands of properly sanitised workspaces, making them instantly bookable by teams and individual workers	Covid-19 has caused a global work from home experiment, with remote work taking place on an unprecedented scale. Many people have struggled with the change in their working environment, the difficulties involved in collaborating remotely and the lack of workplace camaraderie. As we transition into a post-lockdown world, it will be important to provide safe, high-quality working environments where colleagues can be together without having to take long journeys on public transport, which risks spreading or re-spreading infection. Desana enables workers to find quality, properly sanitised workspace near them in coworking spaces and flexible offices. Workspace can be booked for as little as 15 minutes to a whole day at the touch of a button - it's as quick and easy as ordering an Uber, paid for by their company. This means that workers can find workspace near their home and avoid travelling long distances on public transport, contributing to overcrowding and the spread of infection. It also means they have a suitable working environment without the distractions of working from home. For employers, they can instantly provide workspaces convenient to where their employees live without having to establish relationships with multiple workspace operators. This project focuses on developing group booking and 'see where your team is working' functionality within the app. This means that people who need to work together can do so without having to travel to a central workplace which is likely to be much further away from their home. They are also able to socialise with colleagues and enjoy working together in a physical space - benefits lost when working in a distributed workforce. This is important for people's mental health as well as for their sense of purpose. Covid-19 has had an unprecedented impact on the way we work. The wider opportunity is to leverage that impact to alter long-formed working habits that have increasingly had a corrosive impact on our wellbeing: from long commutes to inflexible working hours.

200	HARU LTD	HARU LTD	None	None	None	Haru Ltd - Innovating Charity Retail	Charity Shops have become an important part of both the high-street and communities across the UK since the 1950s. An easy way to recycle second-hand items, the charity retail sector directly diverts 337,000 tonnes of textile from landfill annually, saving the taxpayer £27 million in landfill tax, while raising over a £320 million pounds every year for charitable services in the UK and across the world, including essential work in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. The Charity Retail Sector has very little online presence and relies heavily on being able to sell donated items through their physical shops. With the impact of Covid-19 shops have been forced to shut resulting in the sector losing 98.4% of its revenue. At Haru, our vision is a thriving charity sector empowered by technology. Our mission is to deliver innovative services that revolutionise how the sector operates, creating a more efficient and effective sector. Over the last year, we have been working with charity shops to develop a solution that would allow any charity shop to easily sell items online. This is a physical service supported heavily by innovative technology. Using our model, we have been able to empower a small number of shops to sell online and boost their fund-raising capacity. We intend to invest in and develop the software part of our existing service which will revolutionise how the charity sector sells second-hand donations. This software is an innovative new approach to simplify and make online selling as easy as possible for users of any ability. Our in-store mobile application will allow users to find and price items suitable for online selling. Powered by a proprietary algorithm the application decides the most appropriate sales location, and price for an item, maximising the value of donations. The mobile application will work in tandem with our unique inventory management system designed to easily process and sell high volumes of second-hand items across multiple online marketplaces.

To prevent a 'lost generation', the classof2020 project enables a community-led response. Businesses, organisations and furloughed professionals and workers will be able to share training and development/ materials/opportunities with graduates, unlocking knowledge that is otherwise not productively used. Graduates will be able to access learning for free and exercise their current skills/ upskill further in a self-directed and highly scalable way. Through a peer-accreditation process that draw in professionals, they can prequalify/ accredit their skills development. When the economy bounces back, this shortens time to hiring and shortens post-hiring training time, allowing graduates to reach enhanced productivity faster. The project leverages existing contacts with colleges and universities to reach ca 600,000 graduates.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	43983.0 GBP

In the face of COVID-19 we are expecting people to spend much more time in their homes which has two serious knock-on effects: 1) occupants experience longer exposure to indoor pollutants, increasing the risk of respiratory illnesses; 2) Poor IAQ is linked to COPD, asthma, stroke & heart diseases -- all of which are underlying health conditions, increasing the risk of severe illness from covid-19, putting further pressure on the NHS. To address this challenge we are now developing OptimisAir: an integrated 'Indoor air quality management system' that helps Registered Social Landlords reducing their maintenance costs through automated airflow control combined with AI-based activity-recognition and nudge-techniques to reduce the root cause of poor indoor air quality. It uses IoT-enabled sensors to monitor indoor pollutants and utilises game-changing technologies (machine-learning, activity-recognition, 'nudge'/behavioural sciences) to tackle an age-old problem: poor indoor air quality, dampness and draughts in homes. The outcome of the project creates a novel, patented system at an extremely competitive cost.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	49703.0 GBP
203	LatchAid Ltd	LatchAid Ltd	None	None	None	LatchAid: Modernising breastfeeding support services to help mothers and babies breastfeed during the Covid-19 pandemic and beyond	Breastfeeding support services in the UK are patchy, under-funded, and predominantly rely on face-to-face delivery, which is now paralysed by the Covid-19 pandemic due to social distancing measures. Millions of mothers and babies are isolated at home and suffering in silence when they experience breastfeeding issues. Research shows that 90% of mothers give up breastfeeding before they want to. Among them over 60% are due to pain and health issues (i.e. cracked nipples, breast infection) caused by incorrect latching (how the baby fastens onto the breast) and the lack of appropriate support. Using digital solutions to deliver breastfeeding support is urgently needed. This project provides the platform to achieve this gradually during six months. LatchAid's Beta mobile app contains 3D interactive breastfeeding animations, breastfeeding support chat rooms, and infant-feeding FAQs. It has already been commended as a much-needed, revolutionary innovation by users in 10 different countries across 6 continents. This funding will scale our reach and fast track the development of three additional features, tailor-made in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. They enable the delivery of digital breastfeeding support at scale: (1) Virtual breastfeeding support groups; (2) A virtual breastfeeding supporter (3) Interactive expert webinars. Powered by Artificial Intelligence, our virtual support groups foster a scalable and accessible ecosystem where mothers can learn breastfeeding skills and connect with others for vital peer-to-peer and professional support anywhere, anytime. The virtual breastfeeding supporter chatbot enables us to support millions of users globally 24/7 . We are passionate about improving the breastfeeding outcome and women's feeling of self-efficacy, which will in turn bring substantial benefits to the families and society. Breastfeeding organisations and professionals severely disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic can resume service delivery through our platform. In the short term our objective is to support the UK mothers who are struggling with breastfeeding now. In the long term our mission is to enable the mothers of 800,000 babies born in the UK and 140,000,000 babies born worldwide every year to easily access reliable and trustworthy information and support with their breastfeeding needs.

204	RAWWATER ENGINEERING COMPANY LIMITED	RAWWATER ENGINEERING COMPANY LIMITED	None	None	None	Rawwater 'click-fit' reusable visor for pandemic protection/humanitarian aid	**Reusable visor to protect healthcare staff from COVID-19** Concerned by the number of local GPs, frontline healthcare staff, key workers and carers who were unable to obtain full-face protection in their fight against COVID-19, Warrington-based Rawwater Engineering Company Ltd. set about designing a reusable visor. It took fewer than three days for Rawwater to finalise its proto type design and begin 3D printing visors free of charge for healthcare staff. Unlike traditional disposable visors which use clear acetate sheet and are intended for single use, Rawwater's visor uses strong domestic, catering or medical-quality disposable cling film. After use, the cling film is easily removed and folded in on itself for safe disposal as medical waste. The visor, however, can be reused and re-filmed after first being sterilised with Milton or similar. This means that just one visor and a supply of inexpensive film could help keep a medical worker/key worker safe for the duration of a pandemic or in other circumstances where there is a risk of infection transmission. Unlike acetate that is in short supply, suitable grades of cling film are readily available. The Rawwater visor features a simple click-together design and an ingenious yet straightforward way of tensioning the visor film to ensure it remains taught and clear. The visor is lightweight, comfortable and can be worn over prescription glasses. It does not mist up or impact the vision of the wearer. Rawwater has been printing visors as quickly as it can using two 3D printers. To accelerate production, it has also given other businesses free access to its design. That said, it takes Rawwater 24 hours to print just four visors. And that's a long time. Further development of the design for fast, efficient injection moulding is the answer. Rawwater sees its visor design as providing an effective solution wherever traditional face protection is in urgent need/short supply. The company will use the funds awarded by Innovate UK to: • Further develop the visor design for rapid, cost-effective scale-up, • Research disposable films specifically for use with the visor, • Secure all necessary regulatory approvals, • Work with carefully selected specialists to begin developing emergency visor/film packs for hospitals, healthcare/key workers, overseas and humanitarian aid - in fact, any circumstances where a reusable visor could be the difference between life and death. The project will create at least 5 skilled jobs at Rawwater's research centre.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	49735.0 GBP
205	HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED	HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED	None	None	None	Artificial Intelligence posture scanning app with exercise programme for people with back and neck pain, unable to visit their GP or physiotherapist because of COVID-19.	**Patients with back and neck pain are usually assessed and treated by their GP, physiotherapist, chiropractor or osteopath, in a clinic. COVID-19 prevents this. This means that vulnerable people are now stuck at home in pain.** This project is to develop an app to scan and measure your body at home, using Artificially Intelligent body recognition, then prescribe specific education and exercise treatments. It can help tens of thousands of people move away from pain during and after the pandemic. The app will be a highly creative consumer tool, professionally designed to attract as many people as possible, created by award-winning digital marketers and animators, employing user-centric design. The app scans, automatically and precisely measures, then assesses the patient's whole body using their smartphone. Then, a unique 8-step programme progresses through each part of the body, e.g. neck from the side, ribs from the front, hips from the side etc. For each body part, the user sees: **1 . ANIMATED EDUCATIONAL VIDEOS** * What good looks like * How that part can be distorted (bent, twisted, tilted etc) * How it got like that * How to fix it **2 . THE RESULTS OF THEIR SCAN** * Showing their alignment (hips, lower back etc) **3 . THE RIGHT EXERCISES FOR THEM** * Selects and shows them exercise videos accordingly (already used in clinic) Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence technology enable smartphones to detect body parts; a step on from facial recognition. Our scanner builds on this technology by using the points detected to: 1 . Measure the relative angles of alignment. 2 . Assess postural distortion. 3 . Prescribe specific exercises. **These points distinguish this technology and make it completely innovative.** Healthcare Technologies was created before the pandemic to solve healthcare issues using technology. We had already created exercise videos and a copyrighted educational programme for back pain. Existing AI body scanning apps are for vanity photography, sports exercises or solely for professional use in clinics, only taking images. None have a programme that links measurements to assessment and the prescription of exercises and therefore cannot benefit people in lock-down. We are creating unique technology for direct use by patients themselves, giving us freedom to operate. **Market** Millions of patients with back pain cannot access treatment because of COVID-19 . To focus efforts, social media advertising profiles can prioritise advertising to back pain sufferers who are comfortable with technology. We can then use reviews from these early adopters to broaden the reach.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	49808.0 GBP
206	SLINGSHOT SIMULATIONS LTD	SLINGSHOT SIMULATIONS LTD	None	None	None	Breathing Cities: A Living Model of People and Place	The vision for this project is in the name: Breathing Cities. "_The Covid-19 lockdown has led to cleaner air but will do little to address the issue of air pollution in the long run_  [and ] _world leaders now have a chance to plot a different, cleaner future_"  [1 ]. Slingshot Simulations plans to use this project to help city councils to not only develop their resilience to the influx of traffic and people returning to work but help them find sustainable methods of positively impacting people working and living in cities. Our mission would be to use the data we have as a society and maximizing its potential through our Simulation-as-a-service platform to encourage healthier, breathing cities coming out of Covid-19 . Our main objective is to brace city councils for the impact on, and as a result of, the traffic and people flow as we return to work following the pandemic. By using existing data to forecast and then iteratively, in real-time, update those forecasts, we want to support councils by informing them of the Pandemic situation from multiple environmental and economic angles thus helping them monitor developments and adapt their strategies in an agile manner. The focus will be on working to significantly accelerate our existing partnership with Leeds City Council to find solutions surrounding, transport (including couriers and delivery) and people, specifically how transport and citizens will move around the city following the wake of Covid-19 with the aim for councils to view all possible "what-if" scenarios of traffic and people flows and plan accordingly. For example, helping them with their Clean Air Zone Strategy  [2 ], which is due to be enforced from mid-2020 and could have a further impact on local business, particularly couriers and delivery systems. Our truly original Simulation-as-a-Service platform, has been developed over seven years of R&D at the University of Leeds: * It runs in real-time, allowing businesses and organisations to act immediately * It can produce results within days not months using just flowcharts * And most importantly it uses a "no-coding" approach that both accelerates and democratises the benefits of high-end simulation for businesses big and small. This fresh approach of interactive forecasting, multi-objective optimisations, and "what-if" analysis could lead to a world first: A real "Digital Twin". 1.

UK's CHs play a vital role, however, 28% have confirmed cases of COVID-19 (CareHome.UK, 17/04/2020). Care Homes face extreme challenges reducing transmission, with movement between residents' rooms taking time, adding stress and increasing risk of spreading the disease. **Key Objectives** - ACT will rapidly augment Bluebell's current baby monitor to be suitable for Care Homes, safely and quickly identifying early COVID-19 symptoms in residents. As well as improving care for older people, this will reduce costs and pressure on the healthcare system.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	49753.0 GBP
208	ELECTRONIC MEDIA SERVICES LIMITED	ELECTRONIC MEDIA SERVICES LIMITED	None	None	None	Conquering COVID in Construction – a safe, managed return to site for construction workers	The IHS Markit purchasing managers' index for UK construction dropped to 39.3 last month from 52.6 the previous month, the lowest reading in more than 10 years. The UK construction sector employs 2.4m workers many of whom are self-employed and are unable to benefit from the Treasury's Furlough Scheme. The sector is a significant contributor to the UK's economic activity producing about 6 per cent of the country's total economic output. The vision for the project is an easy to use health check and tracking app that will give the worker and their employer a simple red/green check of their ability to work. This would enable the industry to end the lockdown, re-engage the predominately self-employed workforce and restart economic activity in a significant sector. The red/green advice from the app would be based on: 1 . Daily self-declared monitoring of general health and especially of any symptoms specific to COVID-19 . These declarations will be performed even when the user is self-isolating. 2 . A tracking feature that would record the user's location while at work and who else they have been in contact with (e.g. < 5 metres separation). 3 . Alerting when there are too many people too close together. 4 . Occupancy of any welfare units, so they can self-time their breaks to minimise unnecessary contacts. 5 . Alerting of the user when a co-worker who they have been in contact with is developing symptoms or who has tested positive for COVID-19 . 6 . Machine Learning-based algorithm to track the development of symptoms in the workforce. The app would have a dashboard for the employer showing who is currently on-site, real-time hot spots showing where workers are congregating so they can be instructed to disperse, a list of staff who have reported symptoms or have tested positive, a list of staff who should be self-isolating because they may have come into contact with another infected member of staff, potential return dates for self-isolating staff plus a list of staff who have tested positive for antibodies and may be immune to re-infection. Both China and South Korea have demonstrated the benefit of using tracking and contact tracing to reduce the spread of COVID-19 . Therefore, the proposed system can be part of an industry-led approach that will help the global construction sector to safely return to work.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	49882.0 GBP

Social skills challenges lie at the heart of autism and require social skills training. Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the provision of social training for autistic children in the UK, due to school closures and restrictions on movement and travel. To address this problem, we provide an innovative product that helps children develop social skills while staying at home. The product is designed by autism and social experts, based on effective social training programmes. It uses intuitive, user-centred design; gamification; and responsive technology, to provide an accessible, engaging and safe product for autistic children. The project will be conducted and delivered under Covid-19 lockdown restrictions. The project team will work and collaborate remotely. We will build on work and research we conducted previously, to fast-track the technical development process, and deliver our product before the end of 2020 . The project is beneficial for autistic children, their families and society at large. It enables autistic children to develop their social skills, under Covid-19 restrictions. It builds their confidence and improves their social inclusion, enrolment in formal education, employment prospects and quality of life. It fosters social inclusion and cohesion, and benefits the national economy. The project responds to emerging challenges caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, and builds resilience to cope with any future lockdowns, due to the resurgence of Covid-19 or the potential emergence of new pandemics or other adverse events.

211	SYNDEO LIMITED	SYNDEO LIMITED	None	None	None	Syndeo Digital Well-being Coach	The COVID-19 pandemic is causing dramatic changes to the lives of everyone. The crisis is already impacting on the happiness and mental well-being of the UK population. It will continue to have a negative psychological effect for quite some time. Most people find themselves in an extremely challenging situation and are forced to plan how they cope with the immediate challenges caused by COVID-19 . Equally, many people also need to consider how they plan to bounce back from this crisis. This inevitably means people need to reconsider and change their professional goals. Alongside these personal challenges people are also forced to adapt to these challenges through the means of working virtually. The Syndeo Digital Wellbeing Coach will assist people in adapting to this new reality by augmenting an already existing "Goal-Setting through Happiness" online training course which particularly focuses on setting goals that restore, maintain or increase psychological well-being. The Digital Wellbeing Coach uses the latest A.I. technology to be able to point participants to the most beneficial exercises for them. Thus, this proposed project offers a completely personalised, online experience for participants to work on their goals whilst maintaining the highest levels of mental well-being. The Digital Wellbeing Coach has been created in conjunction with Oxford Brookes University and builds upon research carried out by Dr Christian Ehrlich (Ehrlich, 2012, 2018, 2019; Ehrlich & Bipp, 2016).

Most craft bakeries rely on supplying hospitality businesses such as restaurants and cafes or trading in their own high street shops. The Covid-19 shutdown and lockdown resulted in the loss of most of their usual customers. Therefore, many have introduced home delivery services. This shift from supplying businesses to supplying consumers presents many big operational challenges. Craft bakeries typically deal with hundreds of customer orders every day, all of which need to be produced overnight ready for delivery the next morning. This unique challenge has been addressed from the very earliest days of business computing [1 ] and there are a number of specialised bakery management software systems available, such as Cybake, Flexibake and BaPS. These B2B systems perform the necessary number-crunching to collate customer orders, calculate production requirements, manage recipes, control allergen and nutritional information and organise logistics. However, they are not designed to manage home deliveries. This project will provide craft bakeries with a dedicated online platform that combines consumer-facing e-commerce technology with specialist bakery production functionality. We will re-purpose our existing bakery software platform, transforming it from a business-to-business (B2B) to a business-to-consumer (B2C) system within five months. This system is urgently needed, and we will therefore release new functionality every month. Without this solution, bakers would need to use generic e-commerce platforms for fresh food such as Amazon Fresh, Deliveroo and Uber Eats. However, these do not provide bakers with the necessary specialist functionality and, moreover, have a serious impact on bakers' slim margins. This project will not only assist an industry that has been heavily hit by Covid-19 but will also deliver long-term benefits to society. The current crisis has demonstrated how dependent we now are on supermarkets. By enabling local food producers to supply consumers directly, we can introduce more balance into the supply chain. The "Farm to Fork" movement is well-known; a new "Oven to Door" movement is quickly emerging. Craft bakers are already helping to keep the nation fed and are now providing householders with a much-needed service. This project will help more craft bakeries to do this both in the short and long term.

213	AFFIGO C.I.C.	AFFIGO C.I.C.	None	None	None	Remote Symptom Monitoring for Schizophrenia - Speeding Up Deployment at Scale	Our company, Affigo CIC, a social enterprise, has developed technology to help people with schizophrenia manage their symptoms. Our solution is based around a smartphone app that is used to track symptoms over the course of the day, every day. The captured symptom data can then be viewed by users to track their symptoms over time and this helps them self-manage their condition. The symptom data can also be upload to a secure server accessible to the NHS staff responsible for looking after the service user. The NHS care team can use this to monitor a user's symptoms remotely if they see a pattern of deteriorating symptoms that could be harmful, they can make contact or intervene by stepping up care. We have conducted two randomised clinical trials of our technology and it is proven safe and reliable. Our technology is currently deployed in one NHS Mental Health Trust. In the Covid-19 pandemic our technology can help to address the issues of staff shortage and reducing face-to-face contact. The remote monitoring capability requires less face-to-face contact but also enables staff to continue to deliver assessment, as the care coordinators and clinicians can view the real time symptom data on a secure desktop at the clinical team base, or on their secure devices from any location. However, our solution requires some technical development to make it rapidly configurable and deployable into different NHS Mental Health Trusts. Currently this requires technical programming skills. In this project we will overcome these barriers and make deployment and configuration "self-service", thus enabling rapid roll-out across the whole of the NHS to help overcome staff shortages and to minimise the need for face-to-face contact. Deploying our solution at scale will help protect the NHS.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	41804.0 GBP
214	HIVE COMPOSITES LIMITED	HIVE COMPOSITES LIMITED	None	None	None	Anti-viral hand protection - water soluble healthcare gloves	COVID-19 and other viruses and diseases are spread from person-to-person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person coughs or exhales and the droplets land on objects and surfaces. Others can catch the highly infectious virus by directly inhaling the droplets or touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. The World Health Organisation (WHO) and UK Government advice is to wash hands frequently for 20 seconds using soap and warm water to inhibit the spread of the virus. Soap breaks the fat membrane of the virus and the virus then becomes inactive. Wearing gloves is a convenient way to minimise contamination from viruses, diseases and germs and keep hands clean, but they are only useful when handwashing is either not possible or is insufficient to prevent contamination. If they are worn, they need to be changed frequently. Even if gloves are worn for protection, virus transfer can still occur through touching of face, when taking gloves on and off and cross-contamination from touching multiple items. It only takes one mistake and the virus can be transmitted into the body. In this unique project, we will develop materials for gloves that are biodegradable, dissolvable in water and contain anti-viral & soap additives. Anyone wearing the gloves would wash them off in warm water at 40-50C instead of taking them off. The materials will be stable under normal use but the application of water at 40-50C will trigger the dissolution of the material, release the soap/foaming agents and all will be washed down the drain under the hand-washing action in the recommended 20 seconds. Use of such dissolvable gloves will significantly reduce the risk of virus and infectious disease transfer.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	49543.0 GBP
215	ANDERSEN CALEDONIA LIMITED	ANDERSEN CALEDONIA LIMITED	None	None	None	Covid -19 Environmental and Surfacing testing development	Andersen Caledonia's project is to expand our Coronavirus (CV) environmental testing capability beyond hospitals to benefit the wider community. Recent published data has shown that this Coronavirus(Covid-19) can survive on surfaces for many days: e.g. A set of tests on the cruise ship the Diamond Princess found the virus 17 days after all passengers and crew had left. It is not known how common the transmission of the CV is via surfaces but the possibility of the transmission from surface to hand to mouth has been shown. By providing testing information to organisations such as GP surgeries, care homes, pharmacists, supermarkets, bus fleet owners and dentists, we can enable them to ensure that their facilities stay clean of the virus as far as possible. It is much better that we keep especially high-risk people free of the virus than to work tirelessly to try and save them post-infection. We also need to make everyone feel that they can live their life in social isolation without it becoming a prison. Testing for CV in the environment requires the collection of samples using swabs from high risk surfaces. The swabs are then transported in cool boxes back to our laboratory for testing using a QPCR machine. This machine can look for exactly the DNA/RNA of COVID-19 virus and can identify as little as 100 strands. A single human cell has 92 strands of DNA / RNA. Andersen Caledonia are already a key supplier to the NHS: sterilising gowns and testing hospitals for environmental contamination. Our two testing laboratories are UKAS accredited and serve the whole of the UK. Testing for CV is not without risks to the staff, but our whole team have enthusiastically given their time to develop our capability and we have carefully minimised risks.In addition to our staff we have been able to build our testing service within a matter of weeks due to the invaluable support of our supply base. I am pleased to say that our whole supply base of swabs, viral transport media, QPCR machine and reagents has been sourced from UK manufacturers. We thank them for their support !

216	THIRDFORT LIMITED	THIRDFORT LIMITED	None	None	None	Electronic witnessing solution allowing remote execution of Wills, thereby increasing Wills accessibility during a pandemic and going forward.	Covid-19 has driven the largest increase in the demand for Wills the UK has ever seen ([Law-Society-Gazette-March-20][0]). All demographics are scared about their health, worried for their family's wellbeing and financial security, whilst thinking about the legal and financial ramifications if the worst was to happen. In addition, c.40% of UK over 55 year-olds do not have a Will (Unbiased-2017), largely due to the manual (non-digital) administrative hassle involved. When writing or updating a Will, everyone could benefit from proper legal advice and over 70% (Law-Society-Gazette-2020) of people use a regulated lawyer to help write and execute Wills. UK regulations mean that lawyers must verify a person's ID (to avoid fraudulent claims over assets) before giving advice and a Will must be signed and witnessed by two individuals. These processes typically happen face-to-face with a lawyer, but this is simply not possible during a pandemic, when social distancing and lockdown rules are in place. Worse still, vulnerable individuals who are most at risk and practising shielding are likely to be the most in need of a Will. The UK government has rightly classified Wills lawyers as 'essential workers', however they cannot carry out this essential work. Some Thirdfort client law firms get by via requiring witnessing over garden fences, but with no electronic solution, lawyers are resorting to all kinds of dangerous and cumbersome workarounds. Another Thirdfort client drives to clients with a gazebo to use as a makeshift office to conduct ID-checks and signing/witnessing. If the client lives alone, the lawyer must travel to the client's property with another member of their own household to act as the second witness. If the lawyer lives alone, finding a second Witness becomes even harder. These workarounds are slow, costly and potentially lethal, as it exposes vulnerable clients and essential-workers to Covid-19 . Thirdfort is building a remote ID-checking and E-signing/witnessing mobile-app to allow any individual with a smartphone to write and sign their Will, whilst getting the necessary legal advice. The solution is built on the back of our existing mobile-app which tackles equivalent problems in the property legal market. We will sell the product to Wills-lawyers who will be able to use it in combination with offering legal advice over telephone/video-conference to offer a fully remote Wills service. This new remote offering can then endure post-pandemic, upgrading the archaic, inefficient and potentially insecure way Wills are currently executed.

217	DEEP RENDER LTD	DEEP RENDER LTD	None	None	None	AI-based Image-As-Video Streaming	Deep Render Ltd is a London based deep-tech start-up developing the next generation of AI-based media compression algorithms. Our proprietary and patented technology is at the forefront of machine learning research. Deep Render is combining the fields of artificial intelligence, statistics and information theory to unlock the fundamental limits of image and video compression: The human eye is the best data compressor known to humanity - with compression ratios at least 2,000 times better than everything developed to date. Our Biological Compression approach approximates the neurological processes of the human eye through a non-linear, learning-based approach, thereby creating a novel class of highly efficient compression algorithms. We are world leaders in this domain, and our unique, AI-based image compression technology is already providing a 75% efficiency gain over the best previous compression standards. As global data consumption is growing exponentially with more than 80% of traffic being Image/Video, Deep Render's AI-based compression technology is vital to bypass broadband constraints. The outbreak of COVID-19 has now accelerated this growth, as a result of the crisis, internet usage has increased significantly. In particular, the demand for live-streaming and video-chat services. Therefore we want to apply our already working image compression codec to live-video streaming. The outcome of the project is to extend our image compression codec to an image-as-video live-streaming codec, at least 75% more efficient than the current state-of-the-art. Our target customers are the live video chat services (Zoom, Skype, Microsoft Teams), as well as the entertainment industry, including live streaming platforms (Twitch, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube). Our value proposition is easy to understand. By making file sizes 75% smaller, we directly increase the bandwidth supply of the internet for live-streaming by a factor of 4 . Increasing the bandwidth supply by making file sizes smaller, is magnitudes more value- and time-efficient than increasing the bandwidth supply through rewiring the globe with progressively more fibre-cables. Deep Render is going to help create a new age in which bandwidth constraints are a problem of the past. As a result of COVID 19 solving this problem has gained more importance and Deep Render is determined to create a fast solution.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	50000.0 GBP
218	V2G EVSE LIMITED	V2G EVSE LIMITED	None	None	None	Covid-19 eHealth Data Acquisition Unit (COVeHealth)	The UK is currently in "lock down" due to the novel coronavirus pandemic. Before putting the currently locked down country back to work we need to: 1) Reduce the incidence of cases to reduce the burden on the NHS to more normal levels 2) Once that is achieved, we need to prevent the virus from catching fire a second time To reduce the risk of a second wave, we need to develop tools to enable us to: a) Preemptively identify early stage Covid-19 sufferers b) Use these tools to guard the borders of spaces (hospitals, homes, shops, workplaces, shopping malls, schools, universities etc.) The World Health Organization's message is that we must **"Find, isolate, test and treat every case to break the chains of Covid transmission."** Covid-19 screening tests are currently performed at a modest distance by a health worker using a "no touch" infrared thermometer to detect the tell tale fever. The other common symptom indicative of Covid-19 is the persistent dry cough, detected by the characteristic sound. What is desperately needed, both in the UK and around the World, is a way of performing screening for early stage Covid-19 symptoms remotely. With DfT seed funding V2G EVSE have developed a low cost "smart" 0G to 5G enabled communications controller with a wide range of input/output, currently configured to monitor and control an electric vehicle charging station and securely communicate with a cloud based management system. We will repurpose our existing technology by connecting the controller to a microphone and infra-red camera, then use novel machine learning algorithms to detect the characteristic cough and fever of Covid-19 sufferers. This will allow us to create an installed or hand held device that can be used to identify those with potential Covid-19 symptoms. Since our existing hardware is effectively the internals of a smartphone with no touch screen but more versatile communications, including Bluetooth, we are also ideally placed to participate in the recently announced Apple/Google track/trace initiative. The COVeHealth project will develop proof of concept prototypes of a "commercial" version suitable for use at the entrance to public spaces and an alternative low-cost "domestic" version for use hand held or in confined spaces.

221	TRICERION LIMITED	TRICERION LIMITED	None	None	None	MyVaccineRegister - App/Portal to declare an individual's vaccination against and immunity to COVID-19	MyVaccineRegister aims to create a real-time verified database of individuals who have received a COVID-19 vaccine, who have subsequently been tested for the generation of antibodies and therefore have confirmed immunity to the virus; this is in contrast to the concept of herd immunity - where a subject has been exposed to the virus but not necessarily generated long-term immunity. It will enable registered individuals to return to normal work and not be affected by coming into contact with the virus, whatever the transmission mechanism. It also deals with the issues of social distancing -- since a person who has been vaccinated not only protects themselves, but also reduces the risk of onward transmission. At present, a vaccine is not yet available, but by setting up the platform now, the project will be ready to deploy as soon as vaccines come onstream. It is apparent that several companies (biotechnology and pharmaceutical) are developing a vaccine and that more than one vaccine may reach the market. The platform will be designed to work across any of these vaccines. A key objective is that the platform should be open to all nations and it will need to deliver data accurately and speedily. Once we have created the platform in the UK, we will look to scale globally. The access to an accurate vaccination record and immunity, verified and digitally delivered, will enable the world to live with COVID-19 . Access for the individual is to be via a mobile App (Android/iOS platforms) or portal.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	49775.0 GBP

None	None	None	Accelerating Value to an EEG-based solution for Remote Trials, during COVID-19 (AVERT COVID-19)	The global crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound and widespread effect on healthcare. Priorities have necessarily shifted, and resources have been diverted to assist with the crisis. For many thousands of patients enrolled in ongoing or planned clinical trials, it is vital to maintain safety but also minimise, where possible, disruption to ongoing therapy and preserve their valuable scientific contribution towards drug or biomedical device development. BrainWaveBank's platform is suitable for use across a range of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, designed to track measurement of basic drug mechanisms, stratification of treatment groups, and early detection of response to therapies. It consists of an easy-to-use, wearable headset, accompanied by games presented on a tablet that test different aspects of cognition, yielding brain-based biomarkers of neurophysiological mechanisms and cognitive function. In this project, BrainWaveBank will accelerate the pathway to deliver their platform in a manner that means participants will not have to leave the safety and comfort of their own home, enabling continuing data collection and providing a dependable, user friendly solution during the working restrictions of COVID-19 and beyond.

223	LDT DESIGN LIMITED	LDT DESIGN LIMITED	None	None	None	Respirator Mask (RM) with Self User Fit Test & Tracking Capabilities	The problem we wish to solve is a major problem that has emerged from the Covid-19 pandemic and it specifically addresses the fit, comfort, distribution and compliance fit of face respirators for front line healthcare professionals. Respiratory Protective Equipment (RPE) i.e. FFP3 and facial protection, must be considered when a patient is admitted with a known/suspected infectious agent/disease spread wholly by the airborne or droplet route. Our vision is to allow all NHS workers and Healthcare professionals globally to have a newly designed respirator mask (RM) that can be easily fitted and removed, provides a better seal to the face and is comfortable to wear for longer. The main aim of this project is to allow the users to fit test the RM themselves and log the user and Health and Safety Information directly onto a digital database in real time. Current fit test procedures are very time consuming which leads to inefficiencies in getting a correctly fitted RM to users and the current paper-based method of logging fit test information is an antiquated inefficient process. By providing the user with a new RM, simple test feature and mobile application-based procedure for the fit testing the respirator mask we believe it will improve efficiencies within the NHS and allow healthcare professionals more regular control of their safety in the workplace. The instant fit test feedback will give reassurance to users that they are protected in the best way possible. The data logged by the RM system will be Health and Safety information for an individual and information about where that piece of equipment is in use to help manage stock and distribution of product. The project is split into three main areas: The Respirator Mask Design - This will be a new design using materials that can better form a seal to different face shapes and sizes, improve comfort and make the RM easier to put on and remove. The Seal Test Feature - Will integrate into the respirator and have electronic hardware built into it to log face seal integrity and provide fit approval measurements before a member of staff can start their shift. This information will be pushed to a mobile application. The Mobile Application - Will take the user through the fit test procedure and also log the seal pressure test and ultimately identify if they are suitably protected for their shift.

Using a genetically diverse collection of natural baker's yeast engineered for large-scale industrial processes we breed up to a billion progeny and select cells optimised for the product and process of choice. Baker's yeast has been safely used for over 30?years for the bulk manufacture of biologics, such as insulin and vaccines, and is relatively inexpensive compared to mammalian systems. This project aims to address an urgent unmet need for SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens for the UK's production of serological assays, used to identify individuals with immunity to COVID-19 . Phenotypeca will produce yeast strains for the manufacture of specific antigens for evaluation by Oxford University's Jenner Institute, and build UK partnerships for their supply to serological assay producers. Parts of the SARS-CoV-2 virion have strong homology to other coronaviruses, making it challenging to produce tests that are both specific (no false positives, risking COVID-19 spreading) and sensitive (no false negatives, preventing people with immunity from returning to normal activities). To achieve this, we have designed multiple antigens from unique parts of the virus particle's structural proteins, including an exposed region known to bind the human ACE2 receptor, which has been guided by previous work that successfully made high-quality antigens from yeast after the 2003 coronavirus outbreak.

This increases detection/prevention rates and enforcement against illegal sellers; enables safer public and private procurement, and protects citizens and communities from harm. Organised criminal sellers have been quick to target the urgent need for PPE, testing kits and medicines, as well exploiting people's fears by offering illicit, harmful, Covid-19 "miracle" cures. By focusing on prevention and enforcement, we'll help reduce the $2.2trillion global impact of illicit trade, which deprives governments of tax revenues, harms citizens' health, and pressurises public services. Even before the Covid-19 explosion in illicit supply, fraudulent medicines were recognised by WHO and OECD as one of the most harmful forms of illicit trade. Vistalworks has previously released an AI-driven system to warn shoppers of threats from illicit online sellers in online marketplaces, and just launched a Chrome browser-extension to warn consumers of Covid-19 related risks as they shop online.

226	WILL DAVIS DESIGN LIMITED	WILL DAVIS DESIGN LIMITED	None	None	None	Safety Visors for front-line staff	Studio Davis (a well-regarded product design company based in Bath UK) is seeking funding to scale up production of a full face ECS certified protective visor for donation to health and social care workers at risk of infection from Covid-19 . The initial impetus leading us to design the visor using non-specialist materials and a low cost/ low-skill assembly process came from approaches by healthcare professionals working in local NHS Trusts where supplies of PPE were inadequate. However there is clearly a need for PPE in other contexts where workers are at risk of potential Covid-19 contagion such as social care (care homes/ hospices). Our aim is to meet that need locally by gaining ECS certification for the visor and producing/ distributing 20,000 units by the end of 2020 . Initial design and field testing of the visor is complete with informal approval from healthcare professionals. The visor represents demonstrably high standards of protection, comfort, and time to market at a fraction of the cost (£2.25 per unit) of most certified visors currently available; finished visors will be donated to health and social care institutions. Whilst the visor uses some plastics in its manufacture, negative environmental impacts are considered in the proposal (for example using different materials/ modularity of some parts). Supplier networks are already in place and assembly and packing processes designed: 500 units have already been produced. All of the costs of initial design work, parts, and facilities overhead for the first batch of visors have been underwritten by Studio Davis. The funding sought for the six month period from May to November 2020 will enable us to improve quality by gaining ECS certification in partnership with UL International; to free up staff and estates resource to scale up production to 1000 units per week in order to reach a production volume of 20,000; and to open source and publicise our design/supply/assembly process to enable other small businesses to produce visors for their localities. In doing so the project seeks to contribute to the creation of a more agile, distributed and resilient production network for PPE. This will help to slow the transmission of Covid-19 in key areas, saving lives and enabling economic activity to resume as quickly as possible.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	45000.0 GBP
227	SOFTWARE SOLVED LIMITED	SOFTWARE SOLVED LIMITED	None	None	None	SurveyorTech Connect - Remote property surveying for insurance on your mobile phone	The COVID-19 lock-down is causing disruption to the commercial Insurance Market. Brokers are unable to visit clients or prospects; insurance providers are unable to survey premises or assess losses. This makes it difficult for insurance providers to offer effective commercial insurance to SMEs, pushing up premiums and putting at risk long-standing insurance firms. 'SurveyorTech Connect' resolves this issue by enabling these activities to occur remotely, through a mobile phone, free of charge during COVID-19 recovery period. Its introduction will change working practices in the insurance industry making remote surveying an affordable option. Integrating live video streaming, image and data capture, and data analysis technologies, SurveyorTech Connect uniquely enables an unskilled person to conduct a property survey alongside a remotely-based insurance professional using a smart phone. With no previous surveying experience, a user is guided through a visual inspection of their property inventory, enabling an insurance professional to provide remote insurance and risk management advice or follow up a claim to investigate a loss. Using their phone, the client is prompted to take images, videos or upload documents through the app, which automatically uploads this information to a secure portal for an insurance professional to analyse. Insurers operate a generally outdated traditional model and are already under pressure to survey more risks to manage exposure to financial loss and enrich the data they capture. SurveyorTech Connect will help the commercial insurance market get back on its feet during and after the lock-down and instil a new working habit that will enable insurance businesses to assess more SME's risks, while also realising environmental and economic benefits through reduced travel. Software Solved has a proven track record of developing software solutions for the insurance industry, particularly risk consulting, having developed custom solutions for global insurers like AXA, RSA and QBE. Its specialist Insurance Practice is led by Rob Faulkner, a Chartered Insurance Practitioner with over 23 years' industry experience and a substantial network of both Insurance Brokers and Providers. Software Solved intends to offer SurveyorTech Connect free of charge to enable maximum adoption during the insurance industry's time of need and will target SMEs that are feeling the most pain and have limited resources to develop this product themselves. This will enable Software Solved to learn from user experience allowing it to enhance the product into a commercial offering that will change the way SME risks are handled and surveyed in the long-term.

COVID-19 has changed the landscape of society, but not the way alcohol abuse destroys the lives of individuals and families. WHO has issued guidance highlighting the issues with alcohol with respect to COVID-19  * Alcohol use, especially heavy use, weakens the immune system and thus reduces the ability to cope with infectious diseases.  * Alcohol increases the risk, frequency and severity of perpetration of interpersonal violence such as domestic violence, child abuse  * Heavy use of alcohol increases the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), one of the most severe complications of COVID-19 . The current societal and economic impact of COVID-19 have exacerbated the dependency on alcohol for some patients with data from research company Kantar confirming Alcohol sales increased _22 per cent_ in March 2020 . Significant proportion of patients with mental health and psychosocial issues also abuse alcohol. **SOLUTION** **A fully personalised DBCI Alcohol reduction service.** Our current unique digital programme (FREEDOM 1.0) supports people with 7-steps behavioural change programming to redefine personal life goals and sustain a reduction in the reliance on alcohol. The solution has supported nearly 600 users and enjoys 99% client satisfaction ratings. This programme is based on successful wellness cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), neurolinguistic programming (NLP) coaching programme and 'Sober in Seven' book written by the founder,Andy Smith. Digital behaviour change interventions (DBCIs) offer the potential to increase long term behaviour change and sustained achievement for excessive drinkers receiving an alcohol brief intervention. There is urgent need for a **cost-effective alcohol specific full DBCI solution** that can be easily scaled and with the future use of AI can be developed to provide a more personalised intervention Our project focuses on the development of tailored interventions to be incorporated into the development and deployment of **a fully personalised alcohol DBCI solution** (FREEDOM 2.0). This will be available via all digital platforms (web/smartphone app) and operating systems. We will utilise user feedback and AI/data analytics to increasingly develop a more personalised intervention FREEDOM 2.0 will build on the unique, established and proven existing programme to develop a **cost-effective full DBCI solution** utilising the latest thinking in online support, motivation and coaching approaches. This reflects the NICE guidance and recent trials which suggest cognitive bias retraining, self-monitoring, feedback, and action planning intervention modules enable drinking reduction.

229	EASY AS 123 LIMITED	EASY AS 123 LIMITED	None	None	None	Easy As 123: balance	The project is to take the work we've been doing since 2018 -- creating a full financial data processing system with Client Relationship Management  [CRM ] called kEAper that we will sell on licence to anyone working with self-employed clients -- and to develop the client-facing web & mobile app called **balance**. The project will allow us to finish a free trial version to test the THP tool on self-employed people accessed through networks and partner organisations that we have been cultivating. The specific need is the lack of financial management skills & confidence amongst self-employed workers (including gig workers/side hustlers) often leading to business failure. As the COVID-19 pandemic has proved harshly yet again, the self-employed are an extremely vulnerable sector with often very little safety net, treated as an irritating after-thought by a distrustful HMRC, and they struggle with their financial management -- so many of them may not survive this crisis or even restore their income levels. HMRC's digital tax plans will make things even harder. Uniquely, we started from HMRC's published proposals (which we believe gives a competitive advantage and helps to future-proof) which are to expand Making Tax Digital quarterly tax reporting to all, decrease the VAT threshold, access bank accounts in order to calculate tax 'in-house', and expand self-assessment to everyone. Our approach, compared with existing accounting softwares and banking apps that some in this sector use (85% still use Excel or paper), is to encourage users to: * see the whole picture from their portfolio of activities; * set aside for tax & rainy days (or crises such as now); * focus on vital but understandable analytics; and * build their financial management skills through elearning. We believe the self-employed can be helped towards financial resilience and independence, but that they sometimes need a helping hand, not just from our time-saving technology but from human advisors. That's why we are developing a new role that we call Business Data Interpreter (or BDI). These could be existing Bookkeepers, IFAs, & Business Coaches, or new people entering the sector looking for flexible remote working. BDIs can use kEAper to help with analytics as well as preparing Tax Returns, and so on, and communicate with and assess clients through **balance**.

They bring together skills and understanding of community organising and digital tools to help address some of the challenges created by this pandemic. WeGotYou aims to help reduce the demand for statutory, charitable or organisational support - and to make it as easy as possible for neighbours to help one another get what they need quickly. The app hopes to supplement and assist the incredible work already going on at a local level, including through mutual aid groups, to get help to those isolating and help volunteering activities scale through the use of digital tools while acknowledging the most vulnerable are not always online. Crucially, WeGotYou allows people to get help for others, outside their own neighbourhoods, such as a parent living in another part of the country of an elderly neighbour up the road. 1. Through the WeGotYou website, users can make requests for help for themselves or someone else, such as collecting shopping and medication or walking the dog. 1. Through the WeGotYou app, users will see the requests for help closest to them, allowing them to take immediate action. _Kyle Taylor, Founder of Citizen Sector, said:_ _"Being a good citizen has never - in peacetime - been so essential. All around the world, people want to do their bit and relieve some of the burden on the government and charities. WeGotYou helps people be good citizens and neighbours from their phone, supplementing the incredible work already going on in local communities everywhere. If you'd like someone to bring your mum some fresh milk or to come and walk your dog, WeGotYou."_ _Ned Howey, CEO of Tectonica, said:_ _"Through WeGotYou, our team has managed to transform existing digital organising tools in the space of a week to help people get help for themselves and their loved ones. The scale of the response calls for innovative digital solutions that get help to as many people as possible as quickly as possible. We are proud to have developed part of the answer."_	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	48662.0 GBP
231	INDOOR BIOTECHNOLOGIES LIMITED	INDOOR BIOTECHNOLOGIES LIMITED	None	None	None	Development and validation of a simple cellular immunity test (SCIT) for SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19)	As the current Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic unfolds, we urgently require screening tools that determine who has been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes the disease. To enable the population and the economy to return to normal it is important to know who has become immune to the virus. This includes individuals who have already been infected, in some cases without realising it. In order to gain immunity to SARS-CoV-2, an individual must generate an adequate immune response that protects from future infection. This can be measured by looking for antibodies found in blood samples that bind specifically to the virus. A number of companies have attempted to manufacture a test that determines whether an individual has these antibodies present in their blood. However, as widely reported, all these tests have failed to meet reliability criteria and thus have not been approved for widespread use. Technical hurdles with this type of test may continue to hold up their use. We propose a different type of immunity test, utilising existing laboratory tests. Long-term protection against viruses not only comes from antibodies, but from cells of the immune system called 'T cells', which play a critical role in controlling and eradicating viral infections. From a single tube of blood, we can identify the presence of T cells that respond to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This approach is potentially more sensitive at determining immunity than antibody testing, but this needs verifying on patients that have recovered from Covid-19 . Patients will be recruited by our long-standing clinical colleagues at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, (Prof Andrew Godkin and Prof Paul Morgan) to determine whether a laboratory test for the presence of these T cells is a feasible alternative to the antibody test. This alternative approach would provide the same information about whether an individual has been infected with the virus and generated immunity to it. In addition, when a vaccine does become available, results from the test developed here will yield critical additional information as to whether an adequate immune response that protects individuals from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been generated.

232	PROXIMIE LIMITED	PROXIMIE LIMITED	None	None	None	Proximie Remote ICU Support Service	COVID-19 is arguably the greatest challenge faced by the NHS in its history. Intensive care units (ICUs) are being placed under immense pressure as the virus continues to spread at a relentless pace. New ICU infrastructure is being built; however, the logistics of intensive care provision has yet to be addressed from a workforce perspective. With qualified healthcare providers in high demand and short supply, ensuring that medical expertise is available across the country is challenging. How can the NHS rapidly leverage its clinical resources to meet the growing need? The solution is the Proximie ICU platform. The Proximie ICU system builds on the success of the original Proximie platform, which is a secure and clinically robust solution already deployed in NHS hospitals to connect surgeons remotely during live procedures. Proximie's experienced agile development team will design and build the ICU solution in a three-week period and will work with existing hospital partners to support set-up and develop recommended clinical workflows. The system will be a secure, lightweight platform that can be rapidly deployed in any ICU environment to enable clinicians to compound their expertise and provide advice for multiple patients from a single command centre. The beauty of the solution lies in its extreme simplicity. A laptop, tablet or smartphone and camera are placed at the patient bedside to provide a live video feed. A healthcare professional will be able to instantly alert clinicians that they require support via the click of a button or direct message. A clinician, working remotely or self-isolating at home, can access the Proximie ICU system via the Chrome browser on a laptop and immediately view multiple patient video streams on a dashboard. This information can then be used to provide real-time advice to healthcare professionals at the patient bedside, resulting in timely, and higher quality, patient care. Moreover, the system reduces PPE requirements and the potential spread of infection by decreasing the number of individuals physically present in a clinical area and reducing the time delay associated with having to don PPE. Proximie has received requests from multiple UK and US hospitals to rapidly build and deploy the solution. The platform will be designed with collaborative input from the NHS and the ICU team at Guys and St Thomas' Hospital. This is a responsive, high impact project that will reduce costs and help save lives.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	49845.0 GBP

Severe COVI9 and associated mortality has strongly been correlated withseveral comorbidities including age, diabetes, immunodeficiencies and cardiovascular diseases. Howbehavioral or lifestyle factors, in particular tobacco use, influence the course of COVID19 has not beendirectly examined. Tobacco use, smoking and vaping, is a particular concern since it is directly linked topoor lung health and increased susceptibility to bacterial and viral pulmonary infections including SARSand MERS coronaviruses. Furthermore, patients that use tobacco products are at higher risk for thecomorbidities such as, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases that are risk factors for COVID19. SARS-COV2 infection and tobacco use both trigger and perpetuate a dysfunctional inflammatory cytokineresponse in the lung. We hypothesize that smoking and vaping are primary risk factors associatedwith severe COVID19 and that they directly contribute to morbidity and mortality by exacerbatingthe uncontrolled pulmonary cytokine storm.We will adapt transcriptomics approaches established for our current R61, “Effect of Opioid Use Disorderon HIV Latent Reservoirs and Immune Dysfunction Assessed by Single-Cell Transcriptomics” to gaininsights into COVID19 mechanism of disease. We will initially obtain blood samples from the BostonMedical Center COVID19 biorepository collected from COV19+ smokers and nonsmokers and compare toCOV19-negative individuals and perform state of the art digital drop single cell RNA sequencing, singlecell ATAC-sequencing and computational analysis to provide insights into key innate immune signaturesthat directly contribute to COVID19. Although we will initially focus on blood since this is an easilyobtainable tissue and often provides an immunological footprint of disease, we will compare blood withother clinical tissue samples including lung fluids as they become available.The completion of these studies will provide new insights into COVID19 biomarkers and dysregulation ofspecific inflammatory pathways. A primary goal is to use the results from these proposed experiments togenerate new hypotheses that will guide more mechanistic studies towards understanding epigeneticevents that directly and indirectly influence the course of pulmonary lung infections.

239	BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS	BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS	None	2017-04-01	2022-03-31	Preventing HIV infection among people who inject drugs during COVID-19	This application is being submitted in response to NOT-DA-20-047. Injection drug use has contributed to newHIV outbreaks in many regions of the United States. The parent K01 award seeks to improve the delivery ofantiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to people who inject drugs (PWID) through syringe serviceprograms (SSPs), which provide essential HIV prevention services to this population. Large-scale public healthemergencies, as well as the measures undertaken to mitigate them, can increase HIV risk among PWID (e.g.,by impacting drug market characteristics and drug-related and sexual risk behaviors) while also impacting thedelivery of essential prevention services. This administrative supplement proposes longitudinal, mixed methodsdata collection to understand the impacts of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV or COVID-19) on HIV-related risk among PWID and SSPs’ capabilities to provide PrEP and other HIV prevention services over thecourse of the pandemic. Due to restrictions on in-person research encounters in the context of infectiousdisease transmission, over the course of six months, we propose virtual (video-conference) qualitativeinterviews with 40 PWID and 20 SSP staff as well as modified, weekly quantitative ecological momentaryassessment (EMA) with participating SSPs to understand evolutions in PWID risk behaviors (Aim 1), SSPorganizational functioning and staff wellbeing (Aim 2), and EMA feasibility and SSP service provision in thecontext of a large-scale emergency (Aim 3). Guided by the socio-ecological model, our mixed methodsanalyses will provide critical evidence on how to sustain the delivery of PrEP and other essential HIVprevention services to at-risk PWID during large-scale public health emergencies. Our primary innovations arethe longitudinal examination of individual and organizational responses to the COVID-19 pandemic over time,the use of virtual data collection methods (including EMA with SSPs) that leverage the parent K01 award’snetwork of community research collaborations, and the mixed methods approach to eliciting multiplestakeholder perspectives on the impacts of this unprecedented pandemic on HIV prevention with a vulnerablesubstance-using population. Findings from this supplement will inform efforts to promote sustained HIVprevention service delivery during future public health emergencies while also enhancing the success of theparent K01 award focused on SSP-based implementation of PrEP for HIV prevention in a highly sociallymarginalized population.

240	FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY	Florida International University	None	2020-05-26	2021-04-30	Novel long noncoding RNAs in the airway mucous response	Airway epithelial cells or AECs orchestrate the pulmonary immune responses to airborne viral infections anddrive the successful resolution of infection. Among the immediate early responders that set the tone for innateimmune response, we have identified that as early as half-an-hour of insult, the long noncoding RNA species(lncRNAs) are deployed by the AECs to modulate the epithelial inflammatory response. Specifically, in AECs,we identified a few novel lncRNAs that modulate the expression of inflammatory factors and of ligand/receptorsthat help recruit immune cells. As with the other acute viral infections, a balanced early epithelial responseprovides timely recruitment of appropriate immune cells to thwart the infection and resolve the lung tissueremodeling. However, hosts with hyperreactive or compromised lung mucosal immunity, suffer from higher lungtissue damage, impaired lung functions and overall poor health outcome, as noted in several cases of COVID-19 patients. Overarching goal is to identify and characterize the early host immunomodulatory factors that mightpredispose to severe hyperinflammatory state to novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19 disease. The studies proposed will provide novel insight into theimmediate early susceptibility factors of upper airway epithelial cells to SARS-CoV-2 that contribute to adysregulated inflammatory response. Specifically, the archived biological samples from COVID-19 patients willbe analyzed to establish the association of expression levels of the novel lncRNA and SARS-CoV-2 receptors(ACE2 and TMPRSS2) among individuals with various degree of COVID-19 disease severity. The fixed cytospinsand cell pellets will be analyzed for host cellular (lncRNA and receptors) and viral (Spike protein) factors; andwill be validated by qPCR analysis. We will confirm the role of lncRNA by molecular gene editing in AECs culturedin-vitro and treated with a pseudovirions expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein and validated in separate studiesusing SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate for infection. Levels of inflammatory factors will be analyzed by multianalyteassays. This proof of concept study will help establish the association of novel lncRNAs with COVID-19pathophysiology that could serve as early biological indicators (biomarkers) of airway immune dysregulation andother comorbidities. Molecular studies will also help determine whether targeting the novel lncRNA can helpreduce or suppress SARS-CoV-2 mediated airway inflammatory responses.

The FNIHtherefore has extensive experience working with both NIH and the biopharmaceutical industry and deep familiaritywith NIH’s people, science, practices, and policies.The FNIH has been asked by Dr. Francis S. Collins, Director of the NIH, to assist the agency in its response to theCOVID-19 crisis. The aim of this collaboration is to accelerate NIH research urgently required to respond to thispublic health threat and to save lives by leveraging private-sector scientific expertise, in-kind assets and financialresources to augment federal efforts.Dr. Collins’ request that the FNIH help create a COVID-19 public-private partnership (PPP) to accelerate thedevelopment of therapeutics and vaccines under the Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP) is consistent withthe FNIH’s own mission and the Congressional statute by which the FNIH was established to support the NIH inits mission and to advance collaboration with biomedical researchers from universities, industry, nonprofitorganizations and other federal agencies, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).AMP is a nimble and powerful public-private partnership that includes the NIH, FNIH, FDA and multiplebiopharmaceutical companies and not-for-profit organizations. Managed by the FNIH, AMP programs bringtogether the resources of the NIH and industry to improve our understanding of disease pathways and facilitatebetter selection of targets for treatment. Multimillion dollar collaborations supported by the private sector throughthe FNIH have been established in four major disease areas: Alzheimer's disease, Type 2 diabetes, RheumatoidArthritis (RA)/Lupus and Parkinson's disease. The FNIH is also preparing to launch an AMP in Schizophrenia inpartnership with the National Institute on Mental Health (NIMH).The overarching goal of the FNIH in this new AMP is to support the NIH in designing and implementing a strategicand coordinated cross-sector approach to end the current COVID-19 pandemic and to manage future such threats.This PPP is now known as ACTIV, the Accelerated COVID-19 Therapeutic Intervention and Vaccine partnership.Notably, most AMP projects start with a Design Phase that takes approximately 9 months to complete in which theFNIH identifies key partners, establishes scientific working and sub-groups, puts in place governance structures,executes contracts and agreements, deploys and trains appropriate staff, and identifies potential sources of funding.The result of the Design Phase is a detailed scientific and business plan for the PPP, which is called theImplementation Plan (sometimes referred to as the White Paper). The resulting Implementation Phase is a multiyeareffort in which the PPP, through management by the FNIH, operationalizes the scientific plan and coordinatesthis work with critical support provided by NIH using its grants and contracts mechanisms.However, given the acute public health threat that has resulted in tens of thousands of COVID-19 deaths, the FNIHresponded immediately to NIH’s call to action, redirecting staff from active, fully funded donor-supported programsto begin work on the Design Phase for the proposed PPP even though no financing for the FNIH’s work has yetbeen secured. In fact, for the past four weeks, the FNIH staff has been working non-stop on ACTIV, includingnights and weekends, and has already achieved in record time what under normal circumstances would have takenmonths. This redeployment of staff is not sustainable, and the resulting costs and lost revenue are imposing anunacceptable burden on the FNIH’s finances.This request for support under NIH’s Other Transaction Authority (OTA) is, in fact, a do-or-die matter for theFNIH. While other funding sources have been explored and fundraising continues, none have or are likely to beforthcoming in a manner that is sufficiently timely to support the FNIH’s efforts. Quite simply, without immediatefunding the FNIH will not be able to continue working on ACTIV and hence will be unable to support the NIH andits mission in this devastating COVID-19 health crisis.As requested in the Request for Negotiation to Establish a Public Private Partnership for COVID19 Researchsubmitted by the NIH, the FNIH provides herein information concerning the work the FNIH has and willundertake until July 31, 2020 and the costs to underwrite that work. While much of this activity concerns the DesignPhase, given the urgent need to make progress now, several critical implementation activities are anticipated tocommence before July 31, 2020.Please note that this request also includes a separate request for support of the Deloitte Consulting, LLC (Deloitte)contract with the FNIH. Deloitte was contacted to expand and support the FNIH capabilities given the speed andvolume of work required for ACTIV.	National Institutes of Health	Research Grant	1796424.0 USD
242	HARVARD UNIVERSITY	Harvard University	None	2018-09-01	2023-07-31	High-throughput single-molecule protein identification via super-resolution imaging	Modified Project Summary/Abstract SectionA technology capable of generating robust protein data across various biological states, with the sensitivity and coverage available to next-generation sequencing, would drastically change our understanding of cellular proteomes and ability to detect rare proteins in limited samples. Mass spectrometry is a powerful tool for proteomics. However, it suffers from limited sensitivity (>10{6} molecules required) preventing the identification of low-abundance proteins and single-cellproteomics. A high-throughput single-molecule protein identification method remains a key technical challenge for the proteomic community. Addressing this challenge will dramatically improve the ability to discover and assay novel biomarkers, with transformative impact in our understanding of cancer, immunology and brain research. We propose a robust high-throughput strategy for single-molecule protein identification. This approach will be based on our recent technological breakthrough on developing the highly multiplexed (10-plex; Nature Methods 2014), precisely quantitative(>90% precision and accuracy; Nature Methods 2016), and ultra-high resolution (sub-5 nm; Nature Nanotechnology 2016) DNA-PAINT super-resolution imaging method. Using DNA-PAINT to image a DNA-barcoded and stretched protein will provide a unique optical signature for accurate identification of any proteins in a complex mixture. This method will enable parallel identification of proteins with single-molecule sensitivity, resulting in broadly transformative impacts on fundamental and translational biomedical studies. To address the unmet testing need for the current COVID-19 pandemic, we will also work to develop a rapid diagnostics device.	National Institutes of Health	Research Grant	1319500.0 USD

COVID-19, the infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, is rapidly affectinghumans around the globe. While initial epidemiological data have focused on cases thatresulted in severe respiratory disease seen predominantly in adults, little information regardingthe infection burden in children is available. This is complicated by the observation that manyvirologically-confirmed cases in children are asymptomatic. Undocumented, and likelyinfectious, cases could result in exposure to a far greater proportion of the community thanwould otherwise occur. Indeed, it has been proposed that undocumented (or silent) infectionsare the source for almost 80% of documented infections; thus, it is critical to determine the silentand symptomatic infection rate in children. To overcome challenges for clinical studyimplementation imposed by current healthcare access restrictions, a surveillance study underdesign will enroll and prospectively observe eligible children, and their family members, that arecurrent participants in our NIH-funded, ongoing, birth cohort studies. These children and theirfamilies are known to research staff and as part of their participation in HFHS studies, they havealready been exposed to the procedures involved in a surveillance study. We are requestingsupport for the pediatric studies aligned with our Microbiota and Allergic Asthma PrecisionPrevention (MAAP2) (PI: Johnson, Ownby P01AI089473) to participate in the multi-centersurvey entitled Human Epidemiology and Response to SARS-CoV-2 (HEROS), Protocol #DAIT-COVID-19-001. Our primary objective is to report the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection(detection of virus in nasal secretions) over time in cohort children (index child) and householdcontacts (caregivers and siblings). A secondary objective is to compare SARS-CoV-2 infectionstatus and antibody development for index children/siblings with atopic conditions (e.g. asthma,eczema) versus children without atopic conditions. As an exploratory aim, we will investigatewhether SARS-CoV-2 infection (as determined by virus detected in nasal secretions) isassociated with the presence of virus in stool. Our targeted enrollment is 300 families recruitedover a 2-week period and followed for a minimum of 6 months. At predetermined intervals,biological samples (nasal swabs, peripheral blood, stool) will be collected by the caregiver athome using materials provided to the family. Symptom and exposure surveys will be completedremotely via a smart phone, on-line, or telephone at the time of biological sample collection.This timely, multi-site study can be rapidly implemented and realistically conducted withoutnecessitating any visits to a clinical research center and will provide invaluable information onthe infection burden of SARS-CoV-2 in children.

The development of a “universal” coronavirus (CoV)vaccine would not only be effective against COVID-19 but, in theory, would protect against future,potential pandemic CoV strains. The pathway to such a vaccine will likely focus on the design of novelimmunogens that elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies to conserved viral epitopes, such as the receptorbinding site (RBS). Here we leverage our structure-based, “resurfacing” and glycan engineeringimmunogen design approaches for a universal influenza vaccine and extend it to COVID-19. Our ongoingstudies for influenza demonstrate that our resurfaced, heterochimeric immunogen approach substantiallyincreased the overall frequency of elicited RBS-directed responses and our glycan engineering approachcould effectively focus the immune response to a novel, conserved influenza hemagglutinin epitope; weenvision that implementing comparable immunogen design approaches for COVID-19 specificallyfocusing to its receptor-binding interface epitope would yield similar results. We intend to use thisAdministrative Supplement to generate preliminary data to show the efficacy of our approach for aCOVID-19 vaccine, and to optimize the vaccine regimen in the murine model; the data generated herewill form the basis for future studies for a universal CoV vaccine.

AD isassociated with defective skin barrier function, microbial and viral dysbiosis, as well as various cutaneousimmune abnormalities including type 2 inflammation and decreased cutaneous host defense. The AtopicDermatitis Research Network-Leadership Center (ADRN-LC) provides that scientific strategy andorganizational structure to elucidate mechanisms of skin barrier dysfunction, cutaneous immune responses,and viral determinants of atopic dermatitis (AD). An emerging virus with potential direct implications to ADand other allergic diseases is SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus which causes COVID-19 illnesses,which are rapidly affecting humans around the globe. While initial epidemiological data have focused on casesthat resulted in severe respiratory disease seen predominantly in adults, little information regarding the infectionburden in children is available. This is complicated by the observation that many children experienceasymptomatic infections. Undocumented, and likely infectious, cases could result in exposure to a far greaterproportion of the community than would otherwise occur. Indeed, it has been proposed that undocumented (orsilent) infections are the source for almost 80% of documented infections; thus, it is critical to determine thesilent and symptomatic infection rate in children and to understand why they develop less severe orasymptomatic disease. To overcome challenges for clinical study implementation imposed by currenthealthcare access restrictions, this surveillance study will enroll and prospectively observe eligible children thatare current participants in NIH-funded pediatric research studies and their family members. We will collect nasalswabs from all subjects in 2 week intervals for a 4 month period, again at 6 months, and during respiratoryillnesses. Our group will act as the laboratory processing and analysis site for the study. We will extractDNA/RNA from all swabs and perform a qPCR assay test for the SARS-Cov-2 virus. This will allow us todetermine the incidence of the SARS-Cov-2 in the U.S. population and how it varies between children andadults, and those with asthma and other lung diseases. Secondly, we will perform Dual RNA-seq on RNA fromnasal swabs to determine the host epithelial and immune cell response to infection with SARS-Cov-2 andCOVID-19 respiratory illnesses. This data will also allow us to identify different strains of the SARS-Cov-2 viruscirculating in the U.S., their geographical distribution, and how these strains relate to COVID-19 illness severity.

None	2020-05-28	2021-05-27	Droplette: A Platform Technology for At-Home, Effective, and Rapid Pulmonary Delivery to Reduce Ventilator Use & Hospitalization	Significance: COVID-19 causes significant lung damage in a subset of patients leading to a cascade ofinflammatory cytokine activation (cytokine storm) that develops into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).There are several classes of FDA-approved therapeutics that have significant potential in mitigating thepulmonary inflammation when effectively delivered into the lower airways. However, there is a significanttechnology gap in the ability to safely and rapidly dose and administer these drugs to the lungs.Nebulizers are not used for Covid19 patients due to sterility/transmission risks since their use enables viralparticles to linger in the air for hours; they are also not easy to use or sterilize. Inhalers produce mists that donot reach the lower airways. We have developed a patented platform trans-tissue delivery system (Droplette)comprising the unique combination of a piezoelectric transducer and diaphragm pump to physically deliver largetherapeutics into cells and deep through tissue. We hypothesize that this device will allow deep and more rapiddelivery into the lower airways into the lungs of COVID-19 patients relative to standard nebulizers withoutrequiring active inhalation based on the measured droplet sizes (&lt;3 µm) in the mist generated by the device (i.ethis can function as a rapid, low cost, more effective nebulizer for at-home use). Early intervention and at-home administration will reduce the hospitalization burden and need for ventilation- leading to decreasedhospitalization rates, fewer patients who need to be placed on a ventilator and lower mortality. Additionally, thedevice accepts pre-filled sterile one-time use cartridges containing therapeutic formulations and is Bluetooth-enabled with a paired app, allowing a provider to monitor patients’ usage via telemedicine. PreliminaryData: Droplette has been tested extensively across ex vivo, in vivo, and pilot human studies. We have previouslydemonstrated that Droplette can deliver naked large (>1 MDa) mRNA to the basal layer of mucosal tissue andhypothesize that the same mechanism can enable pulmonary delivery. The device generates a fine, low-pressure mist in a unique transitional flow regime and produces consistent spray pattern, plume geometry,droplet size distribution, and particle size. Droplette generates 100% fine mist (&lt;4.7 µm) that dispenses~1mL/min with a flow velocity of 1-5 m/s. Specific Aims: We will demonstrate that Droplette can delivertherapeutics into the lungs & lower airways. In Specific Aim 1 we will Assess efficacy and delivery of Droplettepaired with Hypertonic Saline (7%) (HS-7%) in treating ARDS/Cytokine storm using cascade impaction studiesand cell/animal studies using models that will mimic a COVID-19 like cytokine storm. In Specific Aim 2, we willdo the same set of studies using two classes of therapeutics currently in trials for COVID-19: epinephrine & anti-IL-6 antibodies.

Although therapeuticintervention including novel pharmaceuticals or the passive transfer of immune serum from recovered patientscould provide short-term relief in mortality and morbidity, the development of a successful vaccine willultimately be required to prevent the continued spread and seasonal recurrence of this disease within theHuman population. However, very little is known about either the quality of adaptive immune response or theviral antigen targets that are necessary to prevent the infection. Here we propose to evaluate a novelvaccination approach recently developed in my laboratory that we will now apply to SARS-CoV-2. Specifically,we will generate Vaccinia virus (VacV) vectors expressing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein that have beenengineered to targeted the S protein for MHC-II presentation. Overall, this study will evaluate whether VacVexpressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein could be a potential vaccine candidate and whether the “immunogenicity” ofthe S protein can be enhanced by targeting the protein for MHC-II presentation.

None	2020-06-02	2022-04-30	Development of a rapid response nucleic acid vaccine strategy for coronavirusepidemics	In response to the emerging COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, this supplement proposal to R44 AI138733-01 will leverage our cutting-edge nucleic acid vaccine strategies, some of which that were developed under thisparent grant. Here, we request supplement funding to develop candidate COVID-19 DNA and RNA vaccinesexpressing optimally designed immunogens for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA)vaccines offer significant promise for providing a rapid response solution to emerging infectious diseasesbecause only a partial genetic sequence of the pathogen is needed to generate a new vaccine. Following in vivodelivery, DNA and RNA vaccines lead to in situ production of antigens, negating the need for a complexmanufacturing and process development required for purified recombinant protein, inactivated or live attenuatedvaccines. Nucleic acids can also be manufactured at low cost and are very stable at room temperatureeliminating the need for a cold chain. This provides a significant savings in the time needed to advance a newvaccine from identification of genetic sequence to clinical testing and distribute it to the population. In addition,possibly due to the ability of nucleic acid vaccines to present antigens in their natural conformation in vivo,antibody responses are generally of higher avidity and broader specificity when compared to antibody inducedby subunit protein vaccines. Further, the intracellular expression of antigens also induces robust T cell responsesincluding potent CD8+ T cell responses that can more broadly recognize different viral strains and mediateprotection via enhanced clearance of the infection. Our approach will compare our optimized DNA and RNAvaccine platform technologies alone and in combinations to identify a lead approach that induces the highestand most rapid development of protective levels of neutralizing antibody after a single administration. In addition,since nucleic acid vaccines tested in our lab have been shown to induce antibody and/or T cell responses thatinduce cross-protective immunity in our universal influenza vaccine studies under our parent grant, we willdetermine if the candidate vaccines exhibit cross reactivity against other coronavirus strains for broaderprotection against future coronavirus strains with epidemic or pandemic potential. Our Aims include: Aim 1-Design and compare immunogenicity of candidate SARS-CoV-2 DNA and RNA vaccines. Aim 2 - Maximizeimmunogenicity of nucleic acid vaccines and rapid manufacture by combining DNA and replicon mRNA vaccinestogether or with recombinant protein and optimizing DNA and mRNA formulations. Aim 3 - Safety andimmunogenicity of the lead COVID-19 nucleic acid ± protein vaccine in the preclinical nonhuman primate model.If successful, should identify a lead candidate COVID-19 nucleic acid vaccine for phase I human clinical trials.

NIAID DAIT SACCC	PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT COVID-19, the infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, is rapidly affecting humans around the globe.While initial epidemiological data have focused on cases that resulted in severe respiratory disease seenpredominantly in adults, little information regarding the infection burden in children is available. This iscomplicated by the observation that many virologically confirmed cases in children are asymptomatic (Dong etal, Pediatrics, PMID 32179660). Undocumented, and likely infectious, cases could result in exposure to a fargreater proportion of the community than would otherwise occur. Indeed, it has been proposed thatundocumented (or silent) infections are the source for almost 80% of documented infections (Li et al, Science,PMID 32179701); thus, it is critical to determine the silent and symptomatic infection rate in children. The purpose of this project is to develop, implement, and report on a surveillance study that will enroll andprospectively observe eligible children who are current participants in NIH/NIAID/DAIT-funded pediatricresearch studies and their family members. Many of these studies are focused on populations of children withasthma or other atopic conditions. The primary objective of this study will be to determine the incidence ofSARS-CoV-2 infection (detection of virus in nasal secretions and stool and antibodies to the virus in blood)over time in children and their household contacts (caregivers and siblings).

Setting: All consultant-led hospital maternity units. Target population: Pregnant women. Health technologies being assessed: Pandemic influenza or other pandemic infection such as COVID-19. Measurement of costs and outcomes: The following outcomes will be compared between women with pandemic infection and comparison women, and explored in different subgroups according to management variations: maternal death, maternal level 3 critical care unit admission, other major maternal complication, preterm birth, congenital anomaly, perinatal death. Sample size: The primary objective of this study is to determine the incidence of pandemic infection in pregnancy. The study size will therefore be dependent on the infection rate among pregnant women, together with the UK maternity rate (currently approximately 750,000 maternities per year). If the patterns are similar to the 2009 influenza pandemic, we anticipate identifying 3-500 affected pregnancies during a 6 month initial study period. Information on up to 1500 comparison women is available from existing UKOSS data. A study of this size will have 80% power at the 5% level to detect a doubling of the risk of any adverse outcome (severe maternal morbidity or mortality, preterm delivery, congenital malformation or perinatal death) in women with influenza compared with comparison women. Project timetable: PRE-ACTIVATION PHASE (provisional start date 1 June 2012) January 2012 Apply for necessary approvals, develop web-based reporting systems, finalise and format data collection form and clinician information. ACTIVATION PHASE Week 1: Study information mailed/emailed to clinicians Week 3: Data collection commenced Months 2-6: Ongoing reporting of new cases, data analysis, production of management guidance and dissemination.

Due to the rapidly evolving outbreak and the mitigation strategies likely to be put in place at different times, analyses of epidemic drivers and policy evaluation need constant updating to provide relevant data-driven evidence to inform evolving public health choices. We will provide rapid, continually updated estimates of key epidemiological features such as disease severity and transmissibility measures and lengths of stay. Surveillance, serological and sequence data (where available) will be analysed accounting for censoring and reporting delays. Mathematical models will be fit to the emerging data streams using Bayesian methods to provide regular forecasting updates and assess the impact of current or potential future interventions. Contact and precautionary behaviours will be monitored in a representative cohort along with information on risk awareness and perceived efficacy of interventions to refine transmission models, improve forecasting, and assess the effectiveness of social distancing measures. Special attention will be given to sharing results in an open and timely manner. Epidemiological parameter estimates and forecasts will be shared on a public website, updated daily. User-friendly web interfaces will allow users to generate model outputs and investigate the impact of specific model assumptions on different policy findings. Highlights of essential results will be gathered in short policy briefs updated weekly. Findings will immediately inform UK policy through participation on UK Government advisory committees.

The problem to solve is this: Our current infrastructure is built for patient testing for specific pathways e.g testing cholesterol via a GP clinic. In this case the GP already has information about the patient, their needs and has the mechanism to feed the result back. Similarly in a hospital setting, a test is ordered for a specific purpose, following a patient pathways. There has not been a need for a uniform test for everybody, where the same information needs to be collected,t he same way in multiple settings and the results communicated back to the patient in a timely and uniform manner. Our current infrastructure based on patient pathways is unsuitable, partly because it is too complex, partly due to lack of inter-operability between systems. Also, no single system is designed to scale across a region or large area. Thomson's Screening's SchoolScreener Imms product has the technology for this is already in place, but final adaptions and delivery to adapt the application for mass Covid-19 automated testing management requires the additional funding in this application. The project will have 4 key parts 1. Work with NHS X and testing provider to finalise functionality required 2. Build and operate the adapted testing system, including load testing and scaling (6weeks) 3. Develop KPI analysis of data and methodology for operating 4. Adapt the application and prepare for scaling up The innovation in this solution is in its adapting an existing system that meets all requirements.The solution is specific and focused to the need and therefore it is quick to implement.

254	BISCUIT TIN PLANNING LIMITED	BISCUIT TIN PLANNING LIMITED	None	None	2020-12-31	End of life transformation	The vision for the 'End of Life Transformation' Project is to encourage and support the change needed to the way we handle the end-of-life planning across the UK. The key focus being to remove the barriers and empower, enable and motivate everyone to get organised and put their affairs and wishes in order. By making our own decisions and planning in advance, storing it all digitally in one place, we make a world of difference to those we love. We eliminate the unnecessary hassle and stress and provide peace of mind at an emotionally distressing time of loss. The solution for this Project is centered around the Biscuit Tin Platform - an innovative digital secure vault to hold all your accounts, important documents, wishes and memories all in one place that are released to those you nominate when you die. It is born from my personal experience of losing my parents and finding out first hand that the way we handle 'end of life' today is completely broken and needs to change. In a world where there are digital tools to simplify almost every area of our lives, not having one to help close them down is a glaring omission. The minimum viable proposition for Biscuit Tin is in beta testing and it is innovative as the first of it's kind in the UK. The objectives of this Project are to manage the increased and accelerated society need for an 'end-of-life' digital proposition resulting from COVID-19 as soon as possible. The key objectives of this Project in support of the CV-19 societal need are: a) alleviate the motivational barriers from the end of life planning process and make it as easy as possible to create, populate and maintain your 'end-of-life' plans and wishes e.g. innovative encouragement, engagement and gamification wizards, links to other related propositions; b) expand the 'end-of-life' features to cover a critical illness scenario e.g. digital storage of 'Advance directives' ; c) further automate the death verification process e.g. Death Certificate uploader; d) removal of unnecessary hassle and stress for families during 'life close down' e.g. enhance the guided help and support and checklists to make the process easier and quicker.

Combating school closures due to the pandemic lock-down of Covid-19, You Teach Me ensures continuation of learning from any location -- school or home. Teachers working in mainstream, special and deaf schools create teaching videos that they send to their pupils to access in any location. Using technology in this way supports their learning before, during and after lessons. The videos are shared with other schools. For the first time, schools of all phases and types can watch and learn from each other, and then improve their own teaching by selecting and sharing teaching videos with those pupils who will benefit from them. "_Using You Teach Me, all staff are able to communicate with pupils in the method that matches their needs. Staff video themselves teaching the lesson and this can be differentiated to match pupil needs. All pupils and parents can access this and respond to staff. This clearly visual resource has allowed pupils and parents to not only learn at home but to remain in contact with staff and their peers. As many of our parents are also deaf, the explanations in BSL help them to support learning too"._ H Shepherd, Head, Royal School for the Deaf Derby Schools already utilising You Teach Me pre Covid-19 have been able to respond positively to the lock-down, reducing negative impact upon the learning of their pupils. "_You Teach Me has proven a powerful vehicle for transferring learning effectively into pupil's homes. No single tool has had a greater impact on reducing the inevitable repercussions of current school closures on pupil learning.

256	METASONIXX LTD	METASONIXX LTD	None	None	2020-12-31	Metamaterial-based Noise Control in Intensive Care Units	Intensive Care Units are noisy places, with alarms and machinery buzzing all around. With Covid-19, they will become frightfully noisier: 10 commercial oxygen concentrators or ventilators are sufficient to create the noisy equivalent of a motorway in a hospital ward. Considering that some of the ventilators built in converted factories are even noisier, imagine how noisy will be the London Excel Centre turned into Nightingale hospital! While the priority is to save patient lives, this noise may be considered to be unimportant. After all, we are at war with Covid-19 . Still, noise in ICUs is proven to impact on the recovery time of patients and on the concentration and mental health of medical staff. Some of the NHS heroes that now work in first-line may even need treatment afterwards, like war veterans. We felt that improving this situation could be our small contribution to the war that is keeping us all isolated. Therefore, in this project, we will study the feasibility of a solution to manage noise in ICUs, based on acoustic metamaterials. This is an innovative engineering and design approach, which allows normal materials to acquire properties not otherwise existent in nature. We will design a screen that can be put up as necessary and can selectively cancel unwanted noise, letting through specific sounds (e.g. patient alarms) if desired. Our screen will be designed to be lighter and thinner than classical sound-absorbing panels, but as effective as very thick plywood in blocking unwanted noise. Metasonixx is a leader in transforming normal materials, like plastic or wood or metal, into acoustic metamaterials, which manipulate sound impacting on them. Our know-how is protected by 3 patents and underpinned by research in two UK universities, Sussex and Bristol. In this project, our engineers will explore mass-production of our prototypes, supported by experienced commercials, to ensure efficient delivery and a realistic exploitation plan, and by ICU staff, to ensure that our product is tailored to real needs. We expect a positive impact on the wellbeing of staff and patients in ICUs shortly after the end of the project and beyond the current pandemic, as our technology will be adaptable to other noise sources. Beneficial applications to noise management in other sectors of our society (e.g. cars, homes and open offices) might stem from this project on the medium/long term.

With their tragic loss comes the arduous task of closing or updating the 10-15 accounts (utilities, TV, mobile, broadband, entertainment, subscriptions etc) that the deceased will have held. The role is left to bereaved families, or an appointed Executor, who will need to seperately call, write or email each company, then wait for up to 10 business days for a reply. Accounts can take weeks to close down. It is consequently a stressful and time consuming task for many, and is considered an unwelcome distraction from the things that really matter. Since service providers need the same key data points to close or update the deceased accounts, **we want to automate this process.** Our service allows users to contact multiple companies, in one go, in under 10 minutes. This works in a similar way to the Government's "Tell Us Once" service, but is for private sector suppliers (utilities, TV, mobile, broadband, entertainment subscriptions etc).

258	FIREFLY LEARNING LIMITED	FIREFLY LEARNING LIMITED	None	None	2020-12-31	The Firefly remote learning platform	The COVID-19 crisis has had a significant impact on schools nationally, which are facing unprecedented lengths of shutdown, creating a clear need for innovation, agility and technology-driven solutions to enable effective adaptation to vastly different ways of delivering teaching and learning. Given uncertain and potentially extended closure timescales, this is critical to ensure students are not disadvantaged or left behind, and parents and teachers are empowered with the tools necessary to deliver learning continuity. As a globally leading educational technology provider, Firefly Learning is extremely well placed to assist schools during this time, with our existing virtual learning platform providing critical technological tools to assist schools, teachers, and students as they transition to entirely new methods of remote, blended learning, and the vastly different teaching pedagogies this requires. In addition to supporting our current customer base, we are currently providing our existing learning platform to new schools for free during this time of crisis. The Firefly platform already represents the forefront of current technology with respect to connecting schools and homes. However, given the unprecedented nature of the current situation, further development and innovation is needed to tailor and adapt the platform and service ecosystem to effectively support a fully remote, blended learning environment, whilst also beginning to address the infrastructure and resource challenges inherent in scaling platform use to handle unprecedented demand, and ultimately extending reach to all schools currently in need. Through this project, we will collaborate with up to 30 new schools, delivering free supply of our learning continuity platform, and providing assistance with integration and customisation. Additionally, we will provide training and consultancy advice for teachers on pedagogy and best-practice for enabling effective distance learning. In parallel, we will collaborate with them through a 3-month programme of iterative, agile development (over the coming term), seeking to adapt and tailor the platform to best facilitate distance learning - providing core functionality enhancements to enable effective learning continuity, parental support and visibility, school insight and critical teaching tools. In an environment where fully remote education has never been mainstreamed, these requirements are not yet fully understood. Therefore, whilst prioritising rapid delivery and enhancement during this time of need, our project will further identify longer-term development priorities for advanced facilitation of distance learning, and infrastructure improvements necessary to achieve stable, affordable and accessible technology solutions for all students.

The problem we are solving together is the ability to associate Government-approved tests for Covid-19 with you, and all other members of the public, in a way that shows the test has been performed and which allows you to easily prove it, all without you having to give away personally identifiable information. The objective is to facilitate a highly efficient process whether Government decides on a strategy of testing in the community, for example tests performed at drive-thru testing stations or tests performed at pharmacies or other approved environments where there is a trusted person to oversee the test. We can do this by using digital technologies which already exist to help adults and children in three main ways: First, without having to give away any private information to people you don't know, to ensure the test you have done for Covid-19 is associated with you and nobody else. There is no room for error so we will ask you to agree to let the person doing the test to use the technology to make an abstract mathematical model of your face. It doesn't take a photo, it doesn't even scan what you look like. It uses AI to work out a set of numbers which represent you and which cannot be mistaken for anyone else. Remember, this is all about not giving away information about you to people you don't know. Second, the technology helps the person doing the test, who might be a NHS keyworker or another trusted person, to match the test to you, and ensure your test belongs to you and only you. Third, you do not need any technology at all to be able to use the results of the Covid-19 test to prove to other people that you have done the test and what the result is. Once the demonstrator receives Government approval we will make it available to everyone who needs it. We really want to help the country get back on its feet as a soon as possible and help you to get on with your life in the way you want to live it.

Regular exercise brings a wide range of health benefits for every age group. However sport and exercise comes with its own risks, which are increased where there is no professional supervision or strategy in place. The goal of this project is to make workouts for those who are exercising on their own, due to COVID-19 social distancing safer, and more effective. To do this we take the same AI technology that is currently used to protect elite athletes from injury, and make it widely available to the public via a smartphone app. The proposed app processes existing data logged with consumer fitness devices and apps, such as Fitbit, Strava or Apple Watch, along with some basic information such as age and body weight. From this it establishes each individual's changing level of fitness, and provides insights and ongoing workout suggestions or recovery strategies each day. The overall aim is that by improving the guidance and safety of physical exercise such as running which is currently experiencing a surge in popularity due to social distancing measures, which are likely to be continued for an extended period of time. We will reduce the number of sports injuries expected in the coming months, thus relieving pressure on the NHS at a critical time, and keeping healthy people away from hospitals and zones where COVID-19 could be easily spread.

The step change in manufacturing rate of NFC circuits and their inclusion in each COVID-19 antibody diagnostic device for home testing allows critically important pandemic mapping data to be available in the cloud for analysis within seconds. This is essential to establish a significant sample size for robust statistical analysis to allow governments to take the correct action quicker to control the spread of the disease throughout the population and to allow informed decision to be made on when lock-downs should be enforced or removed. NFC-4-COVID-19 provides one part of the solution to pandemic management, where antibody tests are distributed through postal services to every citizen and following simple instructions allows a test to run and the test data immediately sent to a secure cloud based data management and dash board system. Without NFC connectivity other forms of data transfer are needed to transfer data from the diagnostic to a SMART phone and then to the Cloud. Optical techniques suffer from poor signal to noise, whilst dierect electrical sensing is more robust. The later is the preferred approach for COVID-19 antibody tests. The project builds on proprietary materials and manufacturing methods developed for long range RFID tags and labels and applies these to make smart phone readable labels and devices. The extreme production rate will enable point of need diagnostics to be developed which immediately transfers sensor data, geo-location and user information to the Cloud for analysis and display by artificial intelligence algorithms, distributed ledger, blockchain and other Cloud Computing platforms, such as Microsoft Azure. In addition, the unique multi-layer process will be more sustainable allowing more complex circuitry to be produced on smaller circuit boards which use less material. Such advances will allow very compact distribution track and trace labels to be produced which may log the environmental temperatures and humidity seen by sensitive goods during storage and distribution.

264	LIFE SCIENCE GROUP LIMITED	LIFE SCIENCE GROUP LIMITED	None	None	2020-12-31	Development of Viral Inactivation Buffer for the transportation of viral contaminated samples	Current Covid-19 testing of patient samples follows guidelines published by the World Health Organisation (WHO), which have been followed by health organisations in developed countries such as the National Health Service in the UK and Centre for Disease Control (CDC) in the USA. These protocols all transport virus 'live' in a cell preservation media that must be kept cool (2 -- 8°C) and has a limited life due to degradation. These samples are potentially infective and necessitate handling as Class Level 3 pathogens from when they are collected from the patient, through shipping, to inactivation in the initial processing at analytical laboratories. This limits the number of laboratories that are able to perform sample testing. During previous Ebola outbreaks (another RNA virus), methods were developed to allow sampling that denatured samples by immersion of swabs in a chemical denaturant that killed the virus and allowed processing by laboratories at a significant reduction in risk in the supply and analysis chain. This methodology of denaturation of swabs by immediate immersion in high molarity guanidine thiocyanate solutions has been shown to be effective in denaturation of both Ebola (with the addition of detergent) and Influenza A viruses and is compatible with high throughput processing in labs. Validation of a viral inactivation buffer (VIB) for Covid-19 samples would not only reduce the risk throughout the analysis chain from sampling to analysis, but also increase the number of laboratories able to process these samples at the lower risk category, with a significant reduction in processing time and the ability to test larger volumes of samples at a local level. This methodology has also been shown to increase the stability of samples, reducing the need for cold shipping and improving sample consistency due to the denaturation of RNAses within the samples.

265	ENSPAN innovationS LTD	ENSPAN innovationS LTD	None	None	2020-12-31	Ensuring SMEs have access to capital	The COVID-19 Situation has exacerbated a pervasive problem: Smaller U.K. companies (SMEs) often struggle to grow and invest in people (jobs), marketing (sales) and equipment (capacity) because of cash flow constraints. Typically, these constraints arise from a) being paid late by the customer, and b) limited access to institutional (bank) capital to invest in the business. Larger customers are notorious for paying their suppliers late because they too are managing the cash flow problem, only at a much larger scale: _"Large companies with lots of buying power carry substantial leverage in negotiations with suppliers. Delayed payments can free up working capital enabling finance chiefs to **strengthen financials at the quarterly close.**"_ - Wall Street Journal (U.K. Companies Penalized for Failing to Pay Suppliers on Time - July 17 2019) SMEs are left with three options: 1) Wait for customers to pay, 2) Apply for bank financing, or 3) Apply for invoice factoring. All of the above have their challenges. Banks have largely been uninterested in SME financing because the cost of due diligence outweighs the benefits of, what are typically smaller loans. Invoice factoring is more expensive to the SME (due to higher invoice fraud risk) and only partially funds the requirement. But primarily, **all of the above take time** - which is critical to solving the **immediate** cash flow problem. Enspan's supply chain financing innovation is to **immediately** advance cash to SMEs against the **actual deliveries** recorded by their customer. By this time, there is hard proof that the customer has taken custody of the goods and has an obligation to pay the SME based upon Purchase Order Terms. The credit rating of the customer is used to determine the interest rate of the SME (which is typically much more attractive than the SME's own interest rate). Enspan's current supply chain platform facilitates digital receiving of goods and provides proof of delivery. We propose to open this delivery information to institutional and retail investors as a way of connecting SMEs with pools of funding - bypassing traditional banks and invoice factoring points of friction and dramatically speeding up access to capital which is critical to keeping SMEs in business, protecting jobs and keeping the U.K. competitive. A byproduct of this is that it has the potential to connect pools of capital (largely private and seeking yield) with new investment opportunities and allow investors to directly support the nation.

We believe, providing structure for both students and parents will be critical during this new norm of balancing education and work. The key objectives of this will be to: * Empower teachers to set classwork based on a flexible timetable. * Provide parents with the ability to overlay their own tasks on the timetable. * Enable students and parents to have a single view of their child's work schedule. Although there are many forms of timetable apps and scheduling software in education - there are none that offers parents the ability to get a birds-eye overview of their child's school work set by teachers whilst having the ability to overlay and assign personal tasks/chores/treats from home based on prior amount of work set.

267	POLICY IN PRACTICE LTD	POLICY IN PRACTICE LTD	None	None	2020-12-31	Accelerated analytics for local authority emergency response	Policy in Practice helps local authorities to unlock the power of their existing administrative data to improve the way social policy and welfare support is delivered across the UK. With over 1.5 million shielded residents, one million new benefit claimants, and thousands of vulnerable children and adults, councils are at the frontline of supporting people impacted directly or indirectly by the pandemic. They have a statutory duty to protect their most vulnerable households and recognise the importance and potential of their existing data to help identify and support people impacted by COVID-19 . Low income households are disproportionately more likely to be affected by the measures put in place to control the pandemic. With benefit caseloads rising rapidly, the administrative data councils hold on low income residents (those in receipt of housing benefit or Universal Credit) can help councils target support quickly to those most heavily impacted. This data is already an essential part of the design and delivery of support at the local level, helping local governments target the right support to the right people. Currently, there is a time-lag between the receipt of administrative data and our ability to deliver meaningful insights, with the process taking up to six weeks and refreshed on a quarterly basis. With conditions changing so quickly due to COVID-19, these analytics need to be delivered monthly and in near real time to maximise their impact and effectiveness and utility for councils. Real-time analytics will help councils to identify newly vulnerable and key affected groups to better mitigate the social and economic costs of this crisis. Innovate UK funding will be used to accelerate a novel approach to ongoing automation efforts with councils, speeding up access to insight from six weeks to two days, and frequency from quarterly to monthly updates. Working with administrative data on a secure, automated scalable basis in the cloud will enable data to be used operationally to support people impacted by COVID-19 . Grant funding will accelerate development efforts at pace, bringing in external expertise to enable real-time monthly analytics to be accessed by a minimum of fifty participating councils. The long-term benefit of the project will be to accelerate a shift in the use of administrative data from processing and resource planning today, toward proactive and targeted support to individuals in the UK and elsewhere, greatly improving the cost-effective delivery of outcomes across a range of social policy areas.

268	ETIC LAB LLP	ETIC LAB LLP	None	None	2020-12-31	Secure Integrated Communications Suite	For this project, Etic Lab will develop a Secure Integrated Communications Suite (SICS) for the not-for-profit legal advice sector, a community of charities dedicated to ensuring that people with limited means receive the support they need to access the UK justice system. Our platform will allow advice providers to chat with clients and leave messages via video, audio or text, to securely transfer important documents and to set appointments with accompanying email and text notifications. It will also support peer-to-peer discovery and communication between advice providers, as well as providing a portal for client feedback. The work of this sector has never been more vital than it is now. Due to the COVID-19 crisis, unprecedented numbers of people are seeking aid with legal issues involving housing, debt, welfare and employment, to name just a few. Advice providers are attempting to address this surge in demand whilst also protecting their staff, clients and the general public by pivoting to remote working. In many cases, this means they have had no choice but to adopt proprietary audio-visual messaging platforms such as Skype, Zoom or Facebook Messenger as a means of providing services to clients. However, these programs do not have the full range of functions required by legal advice providers; nor do they meet the privacy and security requirements of a sector which routinely works with vulnerable individuals and sensitive personal information. As things stand, the sector is being forced to compromise on its values in order to continue serving its clients. SICS would address these concerns by placing the data it produces solely in the hands of the advice sector and its clients. Not only would this ensure the security of sensitive information, it would also enable the sector to use the meta-data generated by the platform (for instance, the length, frequency and purpose of conversations with clients) to systematically evaluate its working practices, supporting charities in their efforts to develop sustainable models for service delivery equal to the challenges of the present. By bringing all legal advice providers together onto a single communications platform, SICS would provide a basis for the sector as a whole to share resources, build community, and come together to ensure that it is able to continue its social mission throughout this crisis and into the years ahead.

269	HEARING DIAGNOSTICS LIMITED	HEARING DIAGNOSTICS LIMITED	None	None	2020-12-31	Audimetroid, a tool for rapid delivery of hearing care and hearing aids	Social isolation during lockdown is putting 15.5 million elderly individuals at increased risk of premature frailty due to fostering mental health deterioration (Armitage 2020). It is absolutely crucial that elderly individuals have ready access to audiology services so they have the strongest possible opportunity of rapidly returning to a socially-active lifestyle following lifting of the lockdown. Our vision is to increase access to care and eliminate waiting times by streamlining provision of hearing aids while simultaneously moving audiology services out of hospital departments and into the community, where the same quality of service can be delivered faster and with far reduced physical contact between patient and care provider, thereby reducing risk of audiology care contributing to continued COVID-19 circulation. We propose delivering this vision by developing technology for "over-the-counter audiometry", wherein hearing assessments and fitting of hearing aids becomes an over-the-counter (OTC) service provided by pharmacies, with referral to specialist audiology departments reserved for patients with severe or complex needs. This vision leverages the recent availability of OTC hearing aids (OTC-HAs). In delivering this vision, we will be addressing three specific themes of the call: healthcare, wellbeing, and community support services. During the project, we will develop an automated testing platform that: i) assesses patient hearing abilities, ii) rules out or responds with suitable referrals to other factors (sudden-onset hearing loss, cerumen impaction, etc), iii) assesses patient suitability for OTC-HAs, and iv) selects the most suitable pre-programmed OTC-HA or otherwise makes a referral to specialist audiology services if OTC care is contraindicated. The project work will be split between i) consolidation of our existing prototype hardware into a market-ready testing platform, ii) extending the software functionality of our existing hearing-screening paradigm to respond to the needs of OTC-audiometry, and iii) working with commercialisation partners to streamline commercialisation and roll-out. The outcomes of the project will take us to TRL 6, ready for regulatory approval and rapid piloting then roll-out with our commercialisation partners. The project builds upon our existing technology for hearing screening assessments, which has received strong interest from researchers and clinicians due to its novel paradigm enabling accuracy advances over incumbent products. The project's innovation is in addressing unmet needs in the emerging OTC-HA market.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	49897.0 GBP
270	SEEAI LTD.	SEEAI LTD.	None	None	2020-12-31	Supporting future radiologists’ education during and after COVID-19 through an AI-supported training environment	Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many trainees and students in radiology are reporting disruption to their education. Social distancing measures and travelling restrictions have limited the traditional trainee-faculty member workstation teaching, and face-to-face lectures have been replaced by live conferences, class recordings, or cancelled altogether. Radiology students have recognised that while various digital resources provide theoretical knowledge, alternatives to practice-based training are limited. To solve the problem, we propose an AI-supported high-fidelity virtual training environment for reporting x-rays. The training system uses an interface of a real diagnostic environment and trainees can report x-ray images with an English free text, emulating the real reporting practice. The AI algorithm interprets the raw report and trainees receive instant feedback. As the system is web-based, it can reach trainees and students whose education has been affected by the global pandemic. Furthermore, it can be of value to educational institutions by utilising the training system for practice-based examinations. Usually, assessors individually review and provide feedback to student's reports. Our system allows automated grading and real-time feedback simultaneously to multiple students. We are a team of domain experts formed of technologists and doctors, focused on developing intelligent solutions to support radiologists. The pandemic has widely disrupted lives, including that of radiology trainees, and forcing changes to how we deliver education. As the end to this pandemic is still unclear, we envision to create a sustainable solution that contributes to the future of radiology education and provide an ever-expanding content to support trainees and students in their life-long learning journey.

271	FAMIIO LIMITED	FAMIIO LIMITED	None	None	2020-12-31	Localgov Childcare Market Resilience Platform (post-COVID-19)	**Vision:** Famiio's long-term vision is to help deliver a UK family information ecosystem that matches the public's technological expectations (that have grown from modern tools provided by companies like Amazon, Booking.com and Expedia) whilst ensuring the delivery and data sits within the trusted governance of local authorities on behalf of citizens. **Key objectives:** To make this happen, we must first address the immediate shortfall in UK localgov data infrastructure. Like so many other areas, COVID-19 is exposing cracks and challenges in our society and supply chains, and both Childcare and localgov data infrastructure are no exceptions. Austerity's impact on LA technology innovation has meant we are ill-prepared to manage service markets and deliver fast-changing information in an efficient manner when needed, as we have seen with the coronavirus. **Main areas of focus:** Famiio will address this need for resilience by developing an innovative Childcare Market Management tool as part of a wider ecosystem, focusing on: 1. **Enabling LAs** to access and share daily availability of Childcare places in their area and across LA borders. 2. **Supporting LAs and Childcare providers** by linking provider care management systems, LA systems and Regulator systems. This will increase market data available to LA Childcare managers and Family Information Services (FIS's), as well as Central Government. 3. **Empowering parents and key workers** to self-serve available Childcare, make informed choices and meet unique needs so that key worker services can be maintained and the wider workforce can access Childcare and return to work post-COVID. 4. **Joining-up legacy LA systems** to provide a low-cost, effective cross-border market network, compliant with new National Open Service Data Standards. **innovation:** Famiio's long-term roadmap includes twenty unique platform innovations, covering data permissions, case management, automated data quality, emerging technology application (ML & AI), etc. This will build on this early market management project, which is focused on establishing novel data infrastructure. We will be better placed then to address economic damage caused by COVID-19 and improve UK resilience for the future, at a fraction of the cost of most national technology initiatives. **Long-term goals:** * Increase national take-up of childcare, particularly a) 30-hour free childcare for 3-4 yr-olds, b) informal childcare (particularly for flexible or unsociable hours), c) out-of-hours/emergency childcare. * Increase social mobility (parents able to return to work through easily-discoverable childcare availability). * Reduce child poverty (parents able to earn more through better access to childcare). * Increase national productivity/GDP (more parents in work). * Reduce unemployment.

In previous studies involving patients with a variety of cancers, we have demonstrated the clinical potential of the technique. Results from the recent FORECAST clinical trial at UCLH showed strong correlation between the LIT score and eventual clinical outcome for 70 prostate cancer patients. Recently, OMS has been invited to participate in a COVID-19 study on health care workers and critically-ill coronavirus patients at a London research hospital. In that study the team hopes to demonstrate the potential for the technique for providing an early-warning indicator of poor immune function for frontline NHS healthcare workers in order to determine who is at greatest risk of contracting coronavirus. The study will also use the LIT(tm) to monitor patients critically ill with coronavirus. Eventually, the technique could be used in many other facets of COVID-19 treatment and clinical research, including providing a new and useful clinical parameter for monitoring COVID-19 patients in intensive care, providing a new clinical parameter for assessing immune status for use in developing new COVID-19 vaccines and therapies, and assessing impact of PTSD (which causes immunosuppression) on healthcare workers after the initial pandemic has passed. In this project the team will develop a novel digital platform to support data analysis. The platform will enable individual assessment of risk/vulnerability based on a number of clinical parameters including the new clinical parameter (LIT) which we have developed. We will develop new mathematical tools and a new smartphone app as part of the project. The key benefit of this project for the general public is the development of a new rapid test for assessing the strength of an individual's immune system.

273	TOUCHBYTE LTD	TOUCHBYTE LTD	None	None	2020-12-31	Contactless Access Control for Construction Sites	Construction sites require the physical input of access codes into a keypad and/or finger print recognition systems to record and monitor staff arriving on site. Since the arrival of Covid 19, construction companies are had to close sites due to the health and safety risks from these unacceptable access systems. Without an access system, the construction companies were not able to monitor who was on site, or the skills and qualifications of each worker. To address this urgent need and ensure industries continue to grow, TouchByte has provided an alternative, safe solution - taking proven Face Recognition capabilities as used by Border and Passport control, and adapting it for safe and secure access to construction sites. TouchByte's solution is completely contactless and frictionless. Workers gain access to a site quickly and efficiently without the need to touch anything. Their face would be detected and checked automatically on arrival at the site, and if verified by the company's database, the worker would be allowed on site - without any need to touch a possibly contaminated entry pad. The accuracy and speed of the technology has extensively increased and its cost reduced dramatically over the past few years, making it cost effective, safe, secure and efficient.

There is an urgent need to longitudinally study theimpact of the pandemic on pregnant women and the care they receive, and to understand the consequences fortheir children’s birth outcomes and neurobehavioral development. Importantly, women with pre-existingsubstance use, mental health conditions and limited economic resources may be at increased risk for the wide-ranging, deleterious sequelae of the pandemic. The proposed project seeks to address these critical gaps bybuilding upon ongoing harmonized research efforts across seven geographically-representative sites from theNIH HEALthy Brains and Cognitive Development study (HBCD) initiative, including New York University, OregonHealth Sciences University, Washington University in St. Louis, University of Pittsburgh, Cedars Sinai MedicalCenter, University of Vermont and Northwestern University. We will enroll pregnant and postpartum women intoa multi-wave study in which we assess medical, economic, psychosocial and substance use risk acrosspregnancy and the perinatal period, studying associations of these factors to infant neurobehavioral developmentduring the first year of life. Our central hypotheses include: 1) individual variation in perinatal COVID-19 relatedstress leads to differences in birth outcomes, parenting stress and infant temperament and neurodevelopmentand 2) substance use, mental health and economic risk enhance susceptibility to negative COVID-19 relatedhealth and psychosocial outcomes. To pursue these aims, prospective longitudinal survey, birth and postpartumdata will be obtained across a 3-month period in N=100 pregnant and new mothers per site (providing a totalconsortium sample of N=700) to generate individual temporal profiles of COVID-19 related experiences andresponses, comparing outcomes with existing data from maternal-infant cohorts obtained prior to the pandemic.Further, to identify avenues for intervention, will evaluate substance use, poor mental health and lowsocioeconomic status as risk factors and coping, agency and utilization of resources as resilience factors thatinfluence COVID-19 related maternal stress and child health and neurobehavioral outcomes. The effects ofgeographic location will be used to examine the influence of pandemic severity, variation in local governmentpolicies and resource availability on these outcomes. Finally, we will collect and bank longitudinal perinatalbiospecimens in N=40 women per site that will provide a foundation for future studies to evaluate the biologicalmechanisms through which the effects on maternal psychological and physical health influence offspring brainand behavioral development. Through this analysis of COVID-19 related stress, contextual factors and childoutcomes, we will develop a comprehensive understanding of effects and modifiers of this event on healthoutcomes in individuals that vary in dispositional risk during perinatal life, one of the most sensitive timepoints inhuman development.

The transition to virtual care could permanently changeSUD treatment delivery. This shift is coinciding with COVID-19-induced social isolation and anxiety, whichcould increase substance use and mental health disorder severity. A common refrain in the treatment andrecovery field is that addiction is a disease of isolation; the cure is connection. To provide virtual treatment andthe connection so essential to recovery, many SUD treatment centers are launching virtual services without amethod for assessing how, where, and why virtual services are affecting their patients' quality of life and SUDrecovery. The ACHESS smartphone app is currently being used at 40 Iowa treatment sites in the parent study,“Test of a patient-centered e-health intervention in addiction treatment settings.” ACHESS offers a guide and amethod for assessing use of virtual services and an unprecedented research opportunity. From 3/3/20 to3/20/20, sign-ups for ACHESS in the parent study increased by 67% compared to the two prior weeks. Activityon the ACHESS app has nearly doubled in the same period! This supplement will address patient andorganizational factors because of their integral roles in providing virtual care and adopting patient-centeredtechnologies. The supplement will enhance ACHESS with new COVID-19 related features designed to helppatients comply with social distancing guidelines, cope with unprecedented social isolation, and access virtualservices and supports. The research will study how patients use ACHESS features, how organizations referpatients to the ACHESS, how they interact with patients in ACHESS, and the overall impact of the ACHESSfeatures. The supplement's research aims are: Aim 1a: Refine ACHESS to provide information, support, anddata on COVID-19, social distancing, adjusting to social isolation, and how to use virtual SUD services. Then,study how patients use existing ACHESS features before (for existing ACHESS services only), during, andafter the announcement of social distancing guidelines. Aim 1b: Assess how the enhanced ACHESS APPaffects anxiety, loneliness, and reported COVID-19 infections. Aim 2: Create ten case studies describing howagencies implemented and used COVID-19 enhanced ACHESS and how their patients used COVID-19enhanced ACHESS. This supplement's projected outcomes will help us understand how to design virtualrecovery systems to mitigate the effects of a pandemic and the resulting social isolation. The results will helpdesign a virtual recovery system that can be used in future emergencies and to address the on-goingchallenges of social isolation in society post-COVID-19.

To understand the full impact of this pandemic on the livesof survivors and the magnitude of this emerging public health crisis, we must study the brain. We helped definethe plague of disabling features suffered by millions of intensive care unit (ICU) survivors called Post-IntensiveCare Syndrome (PICS), characterized by an acquired Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression. Approximately 10% to 15% of COVID-19 patients develophypoxemia requiring hospitalization, which can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome and the need forlife support, including mechanical ventilation. Up to 26% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 require ICUadmission. We hypothesize that COVID-19 survivors who are hospitalized will have a high burden of PICS-related acquired-ADRD, PTSD, and depression. To test this hypothesis, we propose this NIH AdministrativeSupplement to the BRAIN-ICU-2 Study (R01AG058639). This Administrative Supplement will allow us to usethe BRAIN-ICU-2 long-term follow-up infrastructure to collect 6-month cognition, PTSD, and depression datafor a NHLBI-sponsored randomized trial (ORCHID) that is evaluating hydroxychloroquine versus placebo on15-day death, mechanical ventilation, or oxygen supplementation. We will ascertain these 6-month outcomesusing a comprehensive phone battery that incorporates robust neuropsychological tests for memory, attention,language, reasoning, and executive function, and diagnostic evaluations for PTSD and depression. OurAdministrative Supplement is titled “Outcomes Related to COVID-19 treated with Hydroxychloroquine amongIn-patients with symptomatic Disease - Brain Outcomes and Psychological Distress (ORCHID-BUD)” and willconduct 6-month follow-up assessments in 270 adults who are hospitalized with COVID-19 infection andsurvive. ORCHID-BUD has the following specific aims: (1) To determine the epidemiology (i.e., prevalence) ofcognitive impairment (i.e., acquired-dementia) at 6 months and if hydroxychloroquine administration isassociated with improvement in these same outcomes; (2) To determine the epidemiology of PTSD anddepression at 6-months, and if hydroxychloroquine administration is associated with improvement in thesesame outcomes, and (3) To identify modifiable risk factors (e.g., sedatives, isolation, intravenous fluids,pressor, ACE-inhibitor or ARB use, etc.) associated with worse long-term cognitive impairment, PTSD, anddepression at 6 months. To our knowledge, this investigation will be the first ever to conduct robustneuropsychological assessments for SARS, MERS or COVID-19 survivors, and the first among COVID-19 toconduct diagnostic PTSD and depression assessments. This Administrative Supplement will leverage BRAIN-ICU-2 and ORCHID's resources to conduct a high impact and novel investigation at relatively low cost and helpprovide a comprehensive evaluation of COVID-19's effect on long-term cognitive and psychological outcomes.

The pandemic has interfered with many other importantendeavors, including NIH-sponsored non-COVID HIV clinical trials. We need robust plans to implementmeasures to expand SARS CoV-2, allowing research units to resume studies being conducted on HIV, whilemaintaining the safety and well-being of participants and staff. To this end, we have developed strategies relyingon a combination of testing for active disease, evaluating seroprevalence, and conducting operations in waysthat enforce social distancing and utilization of personal protective equipment (PPE). This project is beingimplemented at the Vanderbilt Therapeutics Clinical Research Site (VT-CRS), and the Washington UniversityPrevention & Therapeutics (WPT) CRS. This strategy will comprise two aims that involve research participants,their household contacts, and staff: Aim 1) To utilize resources obtained through this administrative supplementto expand SARS-CoV-2 testing within the regions of our Clinical Research Sites; and Aim 2) To utilize resourcesobtained through this administrative supplement to more quickly and fully resume on-site research activities atour Clinical Research Sites. Among the activities to be implemented are universal testing of study participantsfor infection by CoV-2 PCR prior to study visits, either by staff during parking lot drive-through visits or self-collected remotely by study participants. At one CRS, testing will also be offered to adult household contacts ofstudy participants. There will be active screening for symptoms of COVID-19. There will be CoV-2 antibodytesting at the beginning and end of the project period, of staff and/or study participants. This project willsubstantially expanding CoV-2 testing, and expedite the opening of our NIAID-funded CRSs.

The impact of the pandemic response may delay help-seeking and intervention delivery, widen inequalities, and amplify existing risk factors. Policy-makers and commissioners urgently need longitudinal data on representative populations to guide the mitigation of longer-term impacts at scale. Consequently, we propose broadening the scope of the funded 2020 follow up to the national Mental Health of Children and Young People in England (MHCYP) survey, to include three waves of data collection (June, October, January) and all participants who consented to re-contact. This approach has significant advantages over current convenience surveys, most importantly the use of a well-characterised national probability sample with pre-pandemic baseline data on mental health and risk factors. The aims are: 1/ To track mental health and wellbeing over the course of the pandemic and up to a year afterwards 2/ To identify groups whose mental health may be most adversely affected, and explore risk and protective factors. 3/ To track the impact of and compliance with social distancing measures and school closures on children and families 4/ To examine changes in access to services and support. We will use a combination of online questionnaires and remote semi-structured interviews augmented by health and education data linkages. Content will include child and parent mental health, and impact of covid-19 on education, social and family life. Our output strategy will prioritise rapid dissemination, followed by high impact publications.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	679786.0 GBP

The problem to solve is this: Our current infrastructure is built for patient testing for specific pathways e.g testing cholesterol via a GP clinic. In this case the GP already has information about the patient, their needs and has the mechanism to feed the result back. Similarly in a hospital setting, a test is ordered for a specific purpose, following a patient pathways. There has not been a need for a uniform test for everybody, where the same information needs to be collected,t he same way in multiple settings and the results communicated back to the patient in a timely and uniform manner. Our current infrastructure based on patient pathways is unsuitable, partly because it is too complex, partly due to lack of inter-operability between systems. Also, no single system is designed to scale across a region or large area. Thomson's Screening's SchoolScreener Imms product has the technology for this is already in place, but final adaptions and delivery to adapt the application for mass Covid-19 automated testing management requires the additional funding in this application. The project will have 4 key parts 1. Work with NHS X and testing provider to finalise functionality required 2. Build and operate the adapted testing system, including load testing and scaling (6weeks) 3. Develop KPI analysis of data and methodology for operating 4. Adapt the application and prepare for scaling up The innovation in this solution is in its adapting an existing system that meets all requirements.The solution is specific and focused to the need and therefore it is quick to implement.

The key focus being to remove the barriers and empower, enable and motivate everyone to get organised and put their affairs and wishes in order. By making our own decisions and planning in advance, storing it all digitally in one place, we make a world of difference to those we love. We eliminate the unnecessary hassle and stress and provide peace of mind at an emotionally distressing time of loss. The solution for this Project is centered around the Biscuit Tin Platform - an innovative digital secure vault to hold all your accounts, important documents, wishes and memories all in one place that are released to those you nominate when you die. It is born from my personal experience of losing my parents and finding out first hand that the way we handle 'end of life' today is completely broken and needs to change. In a world where there are digital tools to simplify almost every area of our lives, not having one to help close them down is a glaring omission. The minimum viable proposition for Biscuit Tin is in beta testing and it is innovative as the first of it's kind in the UK. The objectives of this Project are to manage the increased and accelerated society need for an 'end-of-life' digital proposition resulting from COVID-19 as soon as possible. The key objectives of this Project in support of the CV-19 societal need are: a) alleviate the motivational barriers from the end of life planning process and make it as easy as possible to create, populate and maintain your 'end-of-life' plans and wishes e.g. innovative encouragement, engagement and gamification wizards, links to other related propositions; b) expand the 'end-of-life' features to cover a critical illness scenario e.g. digital storage of 'Advance directives' ; c) further automate the death verification process e.g. Death Certificate uploader; d) removal of unnecessary hassle and stress for families during 'life close down' e.g. enhance the guided help and support and checklists to make the process easier and quicker.

This clearly visual resource has allowed pupils and parents to not only learn at home but to remain in contact with staff and their peers. As many of our parents are also deaf, the explanations in BSL help them to support learning too"._ H Shepherd, Head, Royal School for the Deaf Derby Schools already utilising You Teach Me pre Covid-19 have been able to respond positively to the lock-down, reducing negative impact upon the learning of their pupils. "_You Teach Me has proven a powerful vehicle for transferring learning effectively into pupil's homes.

With Covid-19, they will become frightfully noisier: 10 commercial oxygen concentrators or ventilators are sufficient to create the noisy equivalent of a motorway in a hospital ward. Considering that some of the ventilators built in converted factories are even noisier, imagine how noisy will be the London Excel Centre turned into Nightingale hospital! While the priority is to save patient lives, this noise may be considered to be unimportant. After all, we are at war with Covid-19 . Still, noise in ICUs is proven to impact on the recovery time of patients and on the concentration and mental health of medical staff. Some of the NHS heroes that now work in first-line may even need treatment afterwards, like war veterans. We felt that improving this situation could be our small contribution to the war that is keeping us all isolated. Therefore, in this project, we will study the feasibility of a solution to manage noise in ICUs, based on acoustic metamaterials. This is an innovative engineering and design approach, which allows normal materials to acquire properties not otherwise existent in nature. We will design a screen that can be put up as necessary and can selectively cancel unwanted noise, letting through specific sounds (e.g. patient alarms) if desired. Our screen will be designed to be lighter and thinner than classical sound-absorbing panels, but as effective as very thick plywood in blocking unwanted noise. Metasonixx is a leader in transforming normal materials, like plastic or wood or metal, into acoustic metamaterials, which manipulate sound impacting on them. Our know-how is protected by 3 patents and underpinned by research in two UK universities, Sussex and Bristol. In this project, our engineers will explore mass-production of our prototypes, supported by experienced commercials, to ensure efficient delivery and a realistic exploitation plan, and by ICU staff, to ensure that our product is tailored to real needs. We expect a positive impact on the wellbeing of staff and patients in ICUs shortly after the end of the project and beyond the current pandemic, as our technology will be adaptable to other noise sources. Beneficial applications to noise management in other sectors of our society (e.g. cars, homes and open offices) might stem from this project on the medium/long term.

With their tragic loss comes the arduous task of closing or updating the 10-15 accounts (utilities, TV, mobile, broadband, entertainment, subscriptions etc) that the deceased will have held. The role is left to bereaved families, or an appointed Executor, who will need to seperately call, write or email each company, then wait for up to 10 business days for a reply. Accounts can take weeks to close down. It is consequently a stressful and time consuming task for many, and is considered an unwelcome distraction from the things that really matter. Since service providers need the same key data points to close or update the deceased accounts, **we want to automate this process.** Our service allows users to contact multiple companies, in one go, in under 10 minutes. This works in a similar way to the Government's "Tell Us Once" service, but is for private sector suppliers (utilities, TV, mobile, broadband, entertainment subscriptions etc). Longer term, our ambition is to integrate with Tell Us Once, so that the public have **one, free, service, which they can turn to for support.**	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	46634.0 GBP
285	FIREFLY LEARNING LIMITED	FIREFLY LEARNING LIMITED	None	None	2021-09-30	The Firefly remote learning platform	The COVID-19 crisis has had a significant impact on schools nationally, which are facing unprecedented lengths of shutdown, creating a clear need for innovation, agility and technology-driven solutions to enable effective adaptation to vastly different ways of delivering teaching and learning. Given uncertain and potentially extended closure timescales, this is critical to ensure students are not disadvantaged or left behind, and parents and teachers are empowered with the tools necessary to deliver learning continuity. As a globally leading educational technology provider, Firefly Learning is extremely well placed to assist schools during this time, with our existing virtual learning platform providing critical technological tools to assist schools, teachers, and students as they transition to entirely new methods of remote, blended learning, and the vastly different teaching pedagogies this requires. In addition to supporting our current customer base, we are currently providing our existing learning platform to new schools for free during this time of crisis. The Firefly platform already represents the forefront of current technology with respect to connecting schools and homes. However, given the unprecedented nature of the current situation, further development and innovation is needed to tailor and adapt the platform and service ecosystem to effectively support a fully remote, blended learning environment, whilst also beginning to address the infrastructure and resource challenges inherent in scaling platform use to handle unprecedented demand, and ultimately extending reach to all schools currently in need. Through this project, we will collaborate with up to 30 new schools, delivering free supply of our learning continuity platform, and providing assistance with integration and customisation. Additionally, we will provide training and consultancy advice for teachers on pedagogy and best-practice for enabling effective distance learning. In parallel, we will collaborate with them through a 3-month programme of iterative, agile development (over the coming term), seeking to adapt and tailor the platform to best facilitate distance learning - providing core functionality enhancements to enable effective learning continuity, parental support and visibility, school insight and critical teaching tools. In an environment where fully remote education has never been mainstreamed, these requirements are not yet fully understood. Therefore, whilst prioritising rapid delivery and enhancement during this time of need, our project will further identify longer-term development priorities for advanced facilitation of distance learning, and infrastructure improvements necessary to achieve stable, affordable and accessible technology solutions for all students.

The problem we are solving together is the ability to associate Government-approved tests for Covid-19 with you, and all other members of the public, in a way that shows the test has been performed and which allows you to easily prove it, all without you having to give away personally identifiable information. The objective is to facilitate a highly efficient process whether Government decides on a strategy of testing in the community, for example tests performed at drive-thru testing stations or tests performed at pharmacies or other approved environments where there is a trusted person to oversee the test. We can do this by using digital technologies which already exist to help adults and children in three main ways: First, without having to give away any private information to people you don't know, to ensure the test you have done for Covid-19 is associated with you and nobody else. There is no room for error so we will ask you to agree to let the person doing the test to use the technology to make an abstract mathematical model of your face. It doesn't take a photo, it doesn't even scan what you look like. It uses AI to work out a set of numbers which represent you and which cannot be mistaken for anyone else. Remember, this is all about not giving away information about you to people you don't know. Second, the technology helps the person doing the test, who might be a NHS keyworker or another trusted person, to match the test to you, and ensure your test belongs to you and only you. Third, you do not need any technology at all to be able to use the results of the Covid-19 test to prove to other people that you have done the test and what the result is. Once the demonstrator receives Government approval we will make it available to everyone who needs it. We really want to help the country get back on its feet as a soon as possible and help you to get on with your life in the way you want to live it.

Regular exercise brings a wide range of health benefits for every age group. However sport and exercise comes with its own risks, which are increased where there is no professional supervision or strategy in place. The goal of this project is to make workouts for those who are exercising on their own, due to COVID-19 social distancing safer, and more effective. To do this we take the same AI technology that is currently used to protect elite athletes from injury, and make it widely available to the public via a smartphone app. The proposed app processes existing data logged with consumer fitness devices and apps, such as Fitbit, Strava or Apple Watch, along with some basic information such as age and body weight. From this it establishes each individual's changing level of fitness, and provides insights and ongoing workout suggestions or recovery strategies each day. The overall aim is that by improving the guidance and safety of physical exercise such as running which is currently experiencing a surge in popularity due to social distancing measures, which are likely to be continued for an extended period of time. We will reduce the number of sports injuries expected in the coming months, thus relieving pressure on the NHS at a critical time, and keeping healthy people away from hospitals and zones where COVID-19 could be easily spread.

This builds on and improves an existing prototype which has been favourable tested with people with cancer in the north west. The 'mi-wellbeing planner and coach' has a friendly conversational user interface and gently guides the user through a series of steps which generates a personalised, psychological health and wellbeing improvement plan, and then supports the individual in implementing their plan whilst tracking changes in their wellbeing levels using the WHO-5 item wellbeing scale. So many people are and will be experiencing worsening mental health as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic -- for instance stress and anxiety disorders, depression, addictive behaviours, anger control issues, eating disorders, psychosis and even PTSD. Existing mental health support systems, like talking therapies and hot lines, are being and will be overstretched. Our app will help protect and even improve the mental health and wellbeing of volunteers, whilst additionally helping them get better at helping other people take steps towards improved wellbeing over time.

The step change in manufacturing rate of NFC circuits and their inclusion in each COVID-19 antibody diagnostic device for home testing allows critically important pandemic mapping data to be available in the cloud for analysis within seconds. This is essential to establish a significant sample size for robust statistical analysis to allow governments to take the correct action quicker to control the spread of the disease throughout the population and to allow informed decision to be made on when lock-downs should be enforced or removed. NFC-4-COVID-19 provides one part of the solution to pandemic management, where antibody tests are distributed through postal services to every citizen and following simple instructions allows a test to run and the test data immediately sent to a secure cloud based data management and dash board system. Without NFC connectivity other forms of data transfer are needed to transfer data from the diagnostic to a SMART phone and then to the Cloud. Optical techniques suffer from poor signal to noise, whilst dierect electrical sensing is more robust. The later is the preferred approach for COVID-19 antibody tests. The project builds on proprietary materials and manufacturing methods developed for long range RFID tags and labels and applies these to make smart phone readable labels and devices. The extreme production rate will enable point of need diagnostics to be developed which immediately transfers sensor data, geo-location and user information to the Cloud for analysis and display by artificial intelligence algorithms, distributed ledger, blockchain and other Cloud Computing platforms, such as Microsoft Azure. In addition, the unique multi-layer process will be more sustainable allowing more complex circuitry to be produced on smaller circuit boards which use less material. Such advances will allow very compact distribution track and trace labels to be produced which may log the environmental temperatures and humidity seen by sensitive goods during storage and distribution.

291	LIFE SCIENCE GROUP LIMITED	LIFE SCIENCE GROUP LIMITED	None	None	2021-09-30	Development of Viral Inactivation Buffer for the transportation of viral contaminated samples	Current Covid-19 testing of patient samples follows guidelines published by the World Health Organisation (WHO), which have been followed by health organisations in developed countries such as the National Health Service in the UK and Centre for Disease Control (CDC) in the USA. These protocols all transport virus 'live' in a cell preservation media that must be kept cool (2 -- 8°C) and has a limited life due to degradation. These samples are potentially infective and necessitate handling as Class Level 3 pathogens from when they are collected from the patient, through shipping, to inactivation in the initial processing at analytical laboratories. This limits the number of laboratories that are able to perform sample testing. During previous Ebola outbreaks (another RNA virus), methods were developed to allow sampling that denatured samples by immersion of swabs in a chemical denaturant that killed the virus and allowed processing by laboratories at a significant reduction in risk in the supply and analysis chain. This methodology of denaturation of swabs by immediate immersion in high molarity guanidine thiocyanate solutions has been shown to be effective in denaturation of both Ebola (with the addition of detergent) and Influenza A viruses and is compatible with high throughput processing in labs. Validation of a viral inactivation buffer (VIB) for Covid-19 samples would not only reduce the risk throughout the analysis chain from sampling to analysis, but also increase the number of laboratories able to process these samples at the lower risk category, with a significant reduction in processing time and the ability to test larger volumes of samples at a local level. This methodology has also been shown to increase the stability of samples, reducing the need for cold shipping and improving sample consistency due to the denaturation of RNAses within the samples.

292	ENSPAN innovationS LTD	ENSPAN innovationS LTD	None	None	2021-09-30	Ensuring SMEs have access to capital	The COVID-19 Situation has exacerbated a pervasive problem: Smaller U.K. companies (SMEs) often struggle to grow and invest in people (jobs), marketing (sales) and equipment (capacity) because of cash flow constraints. Typically, these constraints arise from a) being paid late by the customer, and b) limited access to institutional (bank) capital to invest in the business. Larger customers are notorious for paying their suppliers late because they too are managing the cash flow problem, only at a much larger scale: _"Large companies with lots of buying power carry substantial leverage in negotiations with suppliers. Delayed payments can free up working capital enabling finance chiefs to **strengthen financials at the quarterly close.**"_ - Wall Street Journal (U.K. Companies Penalized for Failing to Pay Suppliers on Time - July 17 2019) SMEs are left with three options: 1) Wait for customers to pay, 2) Apply for bank financing, or 3) Apply for invoice factoring. All of the above have their challenges. Banks have largely been uninterested in SME financing because the cost of due diligence outweighs the benefits of, what are typically smaller loans. Invoice factoring is more expensive to the SME (due to higher invoice fraud risk) and only partially funds the requirement. But primarily, **all of the above take time** - which is critical to solving the **immediate** cash flow problem. Enspan's supply chain financing innovation is to **immediately** advance cash to SMEs against the **actual deliveries** recorded by their customer. By this time, there is hard proof that the customer has taken custody of the goods and has an obligation to pay the SME based upon Purchase Order Terms. The credit rating of the customer is used to determine the interest rate of the SME (which is typically much more attractive than the SME's own interest rate). Enspan's current supply chain platform facilitates digital receiving of goods and provides proof of delivery. We propose to open this delivery information to institutional and retail investors as a way of connecting SMEs with pools of funding - bypassing traditional banks and invoice factoring points of friction and dramatically speeding up access to capital which is critical to keeping SMEs in business, protecting jobs and keeping the U.K. competitive. A byproduct of this is that it has the potential to connect pools of capital (largely private and seeking yield) with new investment opportunities and allow investors to directly support the nation.

With over 1.5 million shielded residents, one million new benefit claimants, and thousands of vulnerable children and adults, councils are at the frontline of supporting people impacted directly or indirectly by the pandemic. They have a statutory duty to protect their most vulnerable households and recognise the importance and potential of their existing data to help identify and support people impacted by COVID-19 . Low income households are disproportionately more likely to be affected by the measures put in place to control the pandemic. With benefit caseloads rising rapidly, the administrative data councils hold on low income residents (those in receipt of housing benefit or Universal Credit) can help councils target support quickly to those most heavily impacted. This data is already an essential part of the design and delivery of support at the local level, helping local governments target the right support to the right people. Currently, there is a time-lag between the receipt of administrative data and our ability to deliver meaningful insights, with the process taking up to six weeks and refreshed on a quarterly basis. With conditions changing so quickly due to COVID-19, these analytics need to be delivered monthly and in near real time to maximise their impact and effectiveness and utility for councils. Real-time analytics will help councils to identify newly vulnerable and key affected groups to better mitigate the social and economic costs of this crisis. Innovate UK funding will be used to accelerate a novel approach to ongoing automation efforts with councils, speeding up access to insight from six weeks to two days, and frequency from quarterly to monthly updates. Working with administrative data on a secure, automated scalable basis in the cloud will enable data to be used operationally to support people impacted by COVID-19 . Grant funding will accelerate development efforts at pace, bringing in external expertise to enable real-time monthly analytics to be accessed by a minimum of fifty participating councils. The long-term benefit of the project will be to accelerate a shift in the use of administrative data from processing and resource planning today, toward proactive and targeted support to individuals in the UK and elsewhere, greatly improving the cost-effective delivery of outcomes across a range of social policy areas.

295	ETIC LAB LLP	ETIC LAB LLP	None	None	2021-09-30	Secure Integrated Communications Suite	For this project, Etic Lab will develop a Secure Integrated Communications Suite (SICS) for the not-for-profit legal advice sector, a community of charities dedicated to ensuring that people with limited means receive the support they need to access the UK justice system. Our platform will allow advice providers to chat with clients and leave messages via video, audio or text, to securely transfer important documents and to set appointments with accompanying email and text notifications. It will also support peer-to-peer discovery and communication between advice providers, as well as providing a portal for client feedback. The work of this sector has never been more vital than it is now. Due to the COVID-19 crisis, unprecedented numbers of people are seeking aid with legal issues involving housing, debt, welfare and employment, to name just a few. Advice providers are attempting to address this surge in demand whilst also protecting their staff, clients and the general public by pivoting to remote working. In many cases, this means they have had no choice but to adopt proprietary audio-visual messaging platforms such as Skype, Zoom or Facebook Messenger as a means of providing services to clients. However, these programs do not have the full range of functions required by legal advice providers; nor do they meet the privacy and security requirements of a sector which routinely works with vulnerable individuals and sensitive personal information. As things stand, the sector is being forced to compromise on its values in order to continue serving its clients. SICS would address these concerns by placing the data it produces solely in the hands of the advice sector and its clients. Not only would this ensure the security of sensitive information, it would also enable the sector to use the meta-data generated by the platform (for instance, the length, frequency and purpose of conversations with clients) to systematically evaluate its working practices, supporting charities in their efforts to develop sustainable models for service delivery equal to the challenges of the present. By bringing all legal advice providers together onto a single communications platform, SICS would provide a basis for the sector as a whole to share resources, build community, and come together to ensure that it is able to continue its social mission throughout this crisis and into the years ahead.

296	HEARING DIAGNOSTICS LIMITED	HEARING DIAGNOSTICS LIMITED	None	None	2021-09-30	Audimetroid, a tool for rapid delivery of hearing care and hearing aids	Social isolation during lockdown is putting 15.5 million elderly individuals at increased risk of premature frailty due to fostering mental health deterioration (Armitage 2020). It is absolutely crucial that elderly individuals have ready access to audiology services so they have the strongest possible opportunity of rapidly returning to a socially-active lifestyle following lifting of the lockdown. Our vision is to increase access to care and eliminate waiting times by streamlining provision of hearing aids while simultaneously moving audiology services out of hospital departments and into the community, where the same quality of service can be delivered faster and with far reduced physical contact between patient and care provider, thereby reducing risk of audiology care contributing to continued COVID-19 circulation. We propose delivering this vision by developing technology for "over-the-counter audiometry", wherein hearing assessments and fitting of hearing aids becomes an over-the-counter (OTC) service provided by pharmacies, with referral to specialist audiology departments reserved for patients with severe or complex needs. This vision leverages the recent availability of OTC hearing aids (OTC-HAs). In delivering this vision, we will be addressing three specific themes of the call: healthcare, wellbeing, and community support services. During the project, we will develop an automated testing platform that: i) assesses patient hearing abilities, ii) rules out or responds with suitable referrals to other factors (sudden-onset hearing loss, cerumen impaction, etc), iii) assesses patient suitability for OTC-HAs, and iv) selects the most suitable pre-programmed OTC-HA or otherwise makes a referral to specialist audiology services if OTC care is contraindicated. The project work will be split between i) consolidation of our existing prototype hardware into a market-ready testing platform, ii) extending the software functionality of our existing hearing-screening paradigm to respond to the needs of OTC-audiometry, and iii) working with commercialisation partners to streamline commercialisation and roll-out. The outcomes of the project will take us to TRL 6, ready for regulatory approval and rapid piloting then roll-out with our commercialisation partners. The project builds upon our existing technology for hearing screening assessments, which has received strong interest from researchers and clinicians due to its novel paradigm enabling accuracy advances over incumbent products. The project's innovation is in addressing unmet needs in the emerging OTC-HA market.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	49897.0 GBP

None	None	2021-09-30	Supporting future radiologists’ education during and after COVID-19 through an AI-supported training environment	Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many trainees and students in radiology are reporting disruption to their education. Social distancing measures and travelling restrictions have limited the traditional trainee-faculty member workstation teaching, and face-to-face lectures have been replaced by live conferences, class recordings, or cancelled altogether. Radiology students have recognised that while various digital resources provide theoretical knowledge, alternatives to practice-based training are limited. To solve the problem, we propose an AI-supported high-fidelity virtual training environment for reporting x-rays. The training system uses an interface of a real diagnostic environment and trainees can report x-ray images with an English free text, emulating the real reporting practice. The AI algorithm interprets the raw report and trainees receive instant feedback. As the system is web-based, it can reach trainees and students whose education has been affected by the global pandemic. Furthermore, it can be of value to educational institutions by utilising the training system for practice-based examinations. Usually, assessors individually review and provide feedback to student's reports. Our system allows automated grading and real-time feedback simultaneously to multiple students. We are a team of domain experts formed of technologists and doctors, focused on developing intelligent solutions to support radiologists. The pandemic has widely disrupted lives, including that of radiology trainees, and forcing changes to how we deliver education. As the end to this pandemic is still unclear, we envision to create a sustainable solution that contributes to the future of radiology education and provide an ever-expanding content to support trainees and students in their life-long learning journey.

Like so many other areas, COVID-19 is exposing cracks and challenges in our society and supply chains, and both Childcare and localgov data infrastructure are no exceptions. Austerity's impact on LA technology innovation has meant we are ill-prepared to manage service markets and deliver fast-changing information in an efficient manner when needed, as we have seen with the coronavirus. **Main areas of focus:** Famiio will address this need for resilience by developing an innovative Childcare Market Management tool as part of a wider ecosystem, focusing on: 1. **Enabling LAs** to access and share daily availability of Childcare places in their area and across LA borders. 2. **Supporting LAs and Childcare providers** by linking provider care management systems, LA systems and Regulator systems. This will increase market data available to LA Childcare managers and Family Information Services (FIS's), as well as Central Government. 3. **Empowering parents and key workers** to self-serve available Childcare, make informed choices and meet unique needs so that key worker services can be maintained and the wider workforce can access Childcare and return to work post-COVID. 4. **Joining-up legacy LA systems** to provide a low-cost, effective cross-border market network, compliant with new National Open Service Data Standards. **innovation:** Famiio's long-term roadmap includes twenty unique platform innovations, covering data permissions, case management, automated data quality, emerging technology application (ML & AI), etc. This will build on this early market management project, which is focused on establishing novel data infrastructure. We will be better placed then to address economic damage caused by COVID-19 and improve UK resilience for the future, at a fraction of the cost of most national technology initiatives. **Long-term goals:** * Increase national take-up of childcare, particularly a) 30-hour free childcare for 3-4 yr-olds, b) informal childcare (particularly for flexible or unsociable hours), c) out-of-hours/emergency childcare. * Increase social mobility (parents able to return to work through easily-discoverable childcare availability). * Reduce child poverty (parents able to earn more through better access to childcare). * Increase national productivity/GDP (more parents in work). * Reduce unemployment.

In previous studies involving patients with a variety of cancers, we have demonstrated the clinical potential of the technique. Results from the recent FORECAST clinical trial at UCLH showed strong correlation between the LIT score and eventual clinical outcome for 70 prostate cancer patients. Recently, OMS has been invited to participate in a COVID-19 study on health care workers and critically-ill coronavirus patients at a London research hospital. In that study the team hopes to demonstrate the potential for the technique for providing an early-warning indicator of poor immune function for frontline NHS healthcare workers in order to determine who is at greatest risk of contracting coronavirus. The study will also use the LIT(tm) to monitor patients critically ill with coronavirus. Eventually, the technique could be used in many other facets of COVID-19 treatment and clinical research, including providing a new and useful clinical parameter for monitoring COVID-19 patients in intensive care, providing a new clinical parameter for assessing immune status for use in developing new COVID-19 vaccines and therapies, and assessing impact of PTSD (which causes immunosuppression) on healthcare workers after the initial pandemic has passed. In this project the team will develop a novel digital platform to support data analysis. The platform will enable individual assessment of risk/vulnerability based on a number of clinical parameters including the new clinical parameter (LIT) which we have developed. We will develop new mathematical tools and a new smartphone app as part of the project. The key benefit of this project for the general public is the development of a new rapid test for assessing the strength of an individual's immune system.

While these extreme interventions are effective in slowing transmission of the disease, it isnot clear how they can best be implemented and how other local factors (such as population density, agestructure, timing in the outbreak, and smoking prevalence) might impact their efficacy. We are building a globaldatabase of these interventions in order to more carefully explore these questions and allow other researchersto use this data in their research. We will create models to better understand how NPI impact diseasetransmission and how the local context effects the impact of these NPI. We are working with colleagues in NYC,Spain, and Italy with more granular data to better explore these problems. We aim to develop a framework thatis applicable to widely available case notification data.As the disease spreads to vulnerable populations, such as people experiencing homelessness, persons livingwith HIV (PLWH) and TB, we anticipate that the impact on these populations will be more severe and with a higher force of infection. We will are involved in an effort to build a COVID-19 patient data warehouse at BostonMedical Center, the largest safety net hospital in New England. This will also include COVID-19 treatment andtesting data from Boston Healthcare for the Homeless. We will use this data to study the impact of COVID-19 onthese vulnerable populations. We will also leverage our strong relationships with collaborators in South Africa,the Philippines, and Ukraine, where the prevalence of these conditions is much higher, in order to better elucidatetransmission patterns and impact in the developing world. We will estimate the impact of potential treatmentdisruptions due to the pandemic response on HIV and TB populations.	National Institutes of Health	Research Grant	307029.0 USD
301	CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY	Case Western Reserve University	None	2020-06-01	2020-11-30	Case Clinical Trials Unit: Administrative Supplement NOSI AI-20-031.	The primary objective of this supplemental application is to rapidly enhance the ability of the twodomestic CRSs in the Case Clinical Trials Unit to enroll and follow participants in COVID-19 preventionand treatment trials, with a particular emphasis on enhancing the sites’ capacity to collect, process,store, and ship longitudinal biological specimens from these participants at any stage of the diseaseprocess. The following specific aims are proposed to accomplish this objective:Specific aim 1: To expand CRS capacity to identify new SARS-CoV-2 infections and to offer participationin clinical trials and observational studies. A key element to contribute meaningfully to prevention andtreatment trials will be to have access to recently diagnosed persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection who canbe offered participation. Here, we will enhance the capacity of the two CRSs to access these potentialparticipants by establishing partnerships with central laboratory leadership and expanding support forresearch staff who can support expanded testing and offer participation in research early after diagnosis.Specific aim 2: To improve CRS infrastructure to facilitate specimen collection and longitudinal follow-up of SARS-CoV-2 infected study participants. Among the challenges to refashion the CRSs to conductCOVID-19 trials are limitations in access to secure facilities and personal protection equipment. To addressthis, dedicated protective enclosures will be established at the Case CRS, and dedicated PPE will beacquired where needed for the duration of this funding period, which will be the critical interval duringwhich supply bottlenecks are anticipated to persist.Specific aim 3: To enhance participation of at-risk and SARS-CoV-2-infected persons in clinical researchprotocols. Recruitment of at-risk and infected participants into COVID-19 trials will require novelstrategies to reach out into the community, and to engage potential participants into clinical researchdespite no existing connection to the CRSs. To overcome these obstacles, we will devote dedicated effortfrom outreach coordinators specifically to COVID-19 recruitment, and establish online advertisementcampaigns to maximize opportunities for enrollment.Specific aim 4: To increase CRS capacity for processing and storage of biological specimens from COVID-19 research participants. The final barrier to processing, storing, and archiving specimens from COVID-19prevention and treatment clinical trials is the need for enhanced biosafety precautions in the processinglaboratory. At both CRSs, enhanced BSL-2 workstations will be established, with dedicated equipmentwhen needed, to increase the ability to process efficiently specimens derived from COVID-19 trials.

This new human pathogen is genetically, antigenically andphenotypically distinct from coronaviruses that circulate seasonally in humans and causesymptoms of the common cold. SARS-CoV-2 therefore presents many unknowns. To contributeto what we hope will be a broad effort on the part of the global infectious diseases community, wepropose herein to generate critical reagents that will facilitate research efforts and accelerateprogress toward filling critical knowledge gaps. Namely, we propose the construction of aninfectious molecular clone of the GA-83E strain of SARS-CoV-2 and derivatives thereofexpressing fluorescent and luciferase-based reporter genes. An infectious molecular clone, orreverse genetics system, is an extremely powerful tool which allows the generation of viralvariants carrying targeted mutations. This capability will accelerate progress toward criticalresearch goals. For example, the use of variant viruses carrying reporter genes can greatlystreamline identification of small molecule inhibitors and the titration of immune sera andmonoclonal antibodies. Similarly, the ability to introduce targeted mutations is invaluable in effortsto map antigenic sites, identify escape mutations, map determinants of transmission andvirulence, and identify viral features important for zoonotic potential. In sum, the reagent-generation effort outlined herein is designed to rapidly furnish the emerging SARS-CoV-2 fieldwith an essential tool of modern virology.

Currently available data are limited because the impact of asymptomatic and mildlysymptomatic cases is unclear and many people are unable to access a test due to rationing, or may beotherwise unwilling to go for testing or care. This study will address this problem by conducting a nationalprobability sample, where each address may be selected by chance, to develop estimates of the proportion ofadults in the United States that are infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, and the proportion that hashad the disease in the past and may now have immunity. We will use home-based testing techniques tofacilitate participation in this national study. We will also use surveys to better understand participants in oursample. With these estimates, we will conduct disease modeling to understand different scenarios of theepidemic. We will also develop a website to provide information and data to the public.

None	2018-04-01	2021-06-30	Novel Arm Restraint For Critically Ill Patients To Reduce Immobility, Sedation, Agitation and Cognitive Impairment	The goal of this Administrative Supplement to Parent Grant R42AG059451 in response to responsive to PAS-17-065 is to allow mass production of a novel device to provide relief to critically ill patients affected by thesedation shortage resultant from the COVID-19 pandemic. Through access to plastic injection molding,assembly and logistics, Healthy Design will be able to realize an acceptable time frame to produce, makeavailable and support the use of its novel medical device. Healthy Design expects that streamlining productionwill minimize sedation usage while minimizing restraint, agitation, and delirium and increasing mobility withoutextra staff or other valuable resources.The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a ripple effect in our ICU supply chain, not the least of which is asedation shortage. We are conserving as much as possible by utilizing the less expensive and more abundantmedications from the benzodiazepine sedative category which were until now discouraged by published ICUguidelines; however, these supplies are also rapidly depleting. In the ICU setting, sedation is required forconfused patients with vital medical equipment, restrained intubated patients, patients with severe acute lungdisease resulting in ventilator dyssynchrony, and for those dyssynchronous patients who require a paralytic.While all of these categories of illness include COVID and non-COVID patients, in order to reserve sedation forthe most needy patients, we must reduce sedation for other patients. The Exersides™ Refraint™ was createdto safely reduce the need for sedation by reducing restraint and agitation. As immobility, agitation and sedationare known to lead to delirium and post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), there will likely be further benefits ofthe device. Thus far, Exersides™ has successfully completed a preliminary Pilot Study, a Phase I trial and,except for the COVID-related trial suspension, is currently in its multi-site Phase II trial as part of this STTRFast-Track award.Another phenomenon we are facing due to the current pandemic is an almost complete absence of familyvisitation. Together with an overstretched ICU staff, this loss is leading to patients spending more time alonewhile critically ill. Lack of availability to attend to each patient actually encourages increased sedation andrestraint in an attempt to keep everyone safe while caring for more patients. Exersides™ is intended to keepvital tubes and lines safe while allowing thoracic movement for pulmonary secretion clearance, gut functionand muscle tone preservation. Physicians are realizing they will be making difficult choices as to whether it ishumane to place a critically ill patient on a ventilator and strap them to the bed while awake. From our trials todate, we work with nurses and physicians who are familiar with Exersides™ and understand the concept of asafe, alone, awake, mobile intubated patient.The pathway to Healthy Design’s ultimate goal of making the Exersides™ Refraint™ available to all hospitalsin time to address the concerns forced upon us by the sedation shortages is clear. Design Controls and aQuality Management System are in place and FDA registration is completed. Design files for translation from3D printing used to make prototypes to injection molding for mass production are in their final stages. HealthyDesign will partner with Progressive Plastics, Egli Machine Co. or Sinicon Plastics, depending on their bidswhich are currently under consideration. Manufacturing Solutions Inc and Kalow Technologies are bidding on acontract to assemble, package and ship the device. Preliminary quotes are listed in the Budget Justificationsection of this application. Vermont Manufacturing Extension Center is providing assistance to Healthy Designto foster its own workforce including receiving, assembly, and distribution. Healthy Design’s management teamwill lead the efforts to liaise with hospital administrators and purchasing agents to provide a seamless processfor procurement of the novel device.

It is impacting everyone's lives,as well as crippling the global economy, health care systems, and more. The disease is caused by the SevereAcute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pathogen, and it appears to exert its mostdevastating effects on people's respiratory and pulmonary systems although recent reports have also citedcardiac complications in otherwise healthy individuals. Based on analyzed data from confirmed cases in theUnited States between February 12th and March 28th, the CentersforDiseaseControlandPreventiondisclosed that people with substance use disorders such as those with histories of smoking, as well as thosewith diabetes, chronic lung disease, and heart disease may be at increased risk of developing severecomplications from COVID-19.

Vulnerable populations, such as peoplewho use drugs (PWUD), are particularly susceptible both to severe COVID-19 illness as well as health andwell-being consequences associated with the secondary impacts of the COVID-19 epidemic.PWUD are at higher risk of COVID-19 due to high levels of comorbid health conditions and high incidence ofrespiratory impairment due to cigarette smoking. The health of PWUD are also influenced by social policiesand practices implemented as part of COVID-19 response strategies. For example, COVID-19 socialdistancing measures and hospital access restrictions may reduce PWUD's ability to obtain HIV, HCV, andother types of critical health and social services. Those who are on medication assisted treatment may be atrisk for treatment disruptions, and those who attend self-help groups such as NA and AA may be unable toattend meeting or see their sponsors. Engagement in COVID-19 prevention measures may also be moredifficult for PWUD. High rates of homelessness and unstable housing among PWUD, may prohibit their abilityto 'stay in place'. As they may have no place to stay. Unstable sources of income and effort to avoidwithdrawal symptoms may lead PWUD to more frequent interactions with others and less social distancing, aswell as more frequent sharing of injection equipment. As COVID-19 is a novel disease and massive socialchanges have been implemented, which have not been utilized since the influenza epidemic of 1918, there isscant literature to aid us in predicting the long and short-term impacts of COVID-19 among PWUD.Consequently, we propose to conduct a mixed methods study that would entail frequent (bi-weekly) qualitativeassessments of a sample of PWUD and a quantitative survey. We propose these frequent qualitativeinterviews as the situation may change rapidly depending on the epidemic dynamics.The parent grant (R01DA040488) is an RCT to improve HIV and HCV health outcomes and reduce HIV, HCV,and drug overdose risk behaviors among people who inject drugs (index participants) and their social networkmembers.

Although the SARS coronaviruses are “respiratory” viruses, they are also neuro-invasive, and neurological signs are common (Desforges et al 2014). Since AUD has increased markedly in the COVID-19 pandemic, and also causes neurotoxicity, there is a clear potential for enhanced neurological sequelae of infection by SARS CoV-2 in patients with AUD. One neurotoxic mechanism of coronaviruses is “excitotoxicity” via activation of NMDA receptors (Brison et al, 2014), and this is also a mechanism for neurotoxicity in AWD. This parallels neurotoxicity associated with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in which the cleaved viral coat protein, Tat, causes excitotoxicity, which is enhanced by AWD (Self et al 2004). Since JR220 is an inhibitory modulator of the NMDA receptor, and inhibits AWD-induced neurotoxicity, it should inhibit any enhancement of coronavirus or HIV neurotoxicity caused by AWD, and may inhibit viral neurotoxicity itself. The closest analog of HIV Tat in SARS CoV-2 is the spike protein (SP) subunit that is cleaved from the virus after internalization, and accumulates in neurons. The first specific aim is to test this SP subunit protein, and later other SARS CoV-2 coat proteins, for neurotoxic damage in organotypic hippocampal cultures (OHCs), either alone or during AWD. The second specific aim is to test JR220 for protection against SARS CoV-2 protein or HIV Tat-induced neurotoxicity in OHCs, with or without concomitant AWD. The predictions are that JR220 will prevent enhancement of viral protein neurotoxicity associated with AWD, and may also inhibit SARS CoV-2 protein and HIV Tat neurotoxicity. This proposal is directly relevant to clinical treatment of AUD during COVID-19. It should also identify important new indications for JR220, and strengthen the IP and commercial potential of this drug.	National Institutes of Health	Research Grant	794605.0 USD

COVID-19 cases in the New York City (NYC) tri-statearea continue to rise exponentially and the region is now the epicenter of the crisis in the United States. InNYC alone, there are over 21,000 cases (~40% ≥40 years of age) as of March 26, 2020. Many symptomaticCOVID-19 patients have features of a cytokine storm and/or macrophage activation syndrome, includingelevated levels of interleukin (IL)-6. An overly robust local neutrophil influx may also contribute to the robustimmune response with associated severe cardiopulmonary complications, including acute respiratory distresssyndrome requiring mechanical ventilation and myocarditis with cardiogenic shock. Colchicine is a safe, well-tolerated anti-inflammatory agent that suppresses the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby blockingconversion of pro-IL-1β to active IL-1β, which leads to secondary reductions in other cytokines including IL-6along with inhibition of macrophage activation. Colchicine also preferentially accumulates in neutrophilscompared with other inflammatory cells and inhibits chemotaxis, endothelial adhesion, and extravasation ofneutrophils at sites of endothelial or tissue inflammation. The effects of colchicine in preventing the cytokinestorm and/or macrophage activation syndrome that leads to clinical deterioration in COVID-19, however, is notknown. Colchicine is not known to inhibit acquired immunity, and is not contraindicated in patients withinfection.The COLCORONA study is a Canadian government-funded randomized trial of colchicine vs. placebo for 30days in 6,000 non-hospitalized subjects 40 years of age with COVID-19 diagnosis and at least one high-riskcriterion. This proposal leverages the COLCORONA Trial infrastructure and pragmatic study design with virtualconsent, randomization, and follow-up to rapidly implement the COLCORONA-NYC Study and allow potentialeligible subjects in the NYC tri-state area to participate. The overall aim of the study is to determine the effectof colchicine on the composite of death or the need for hospitalization in non-hospitalized adults with COVID-19. The data collected through the COLCORONA-NYC study will provide novel data on treatment of COVID-19patients, and have public health implications beyond the scope of the current application, including thepotential reduction in the healthcare resources heavily used in COVID-19 (e.g., hospital beds, ventilators), andpotential future use in other infectious causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome.

One isrigorous ribozyme mechanism and the other is discovery-based RNA structural genomics. A major goal of theparent award is to bridge these two areas to discover new RNA biology and to characterize it at the molecularlevel. This proposal advances ways to investigate RNA structure and its contribution to the COVID-19outbreak. We have already computationally identified structural domains in the RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2,which causes COVID-19, and confirmed these with recent reports on BioRxiv. Uniquely, we identified potentialpseudoknots, which are regions of RNA folding complexity that are typically essential for function. The plan forthe summer is for our undergraduate student Peter Forstmeier to work through the thousands of availableSARS-CoV-2 genomes that contain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify changes in pseudoknotstrength and RNA folding. SNPs in pseudoknots may lead to changes in the stability of the structure, as so-called riboSNitches. The effect of these SNPs on pseudoknots may have implications on the spread andpotential virulence of COVID-19. Our hypothesis is that such information will provide targets for therapeutics,both antisense oligonucleotides and small molecules, which can halt spread of the virus. This administrativesupplement would provide a unique opportunity for Peter to advance his training to pursue his eventual goal ofbeing a physician-scientist. Because it is computational, it is amenable to working from home during thepandemic, and we can mentor Peter using videoconferencing. Peter is a rising junior and has already spent ayear in the Bevilacqua lab developing his coding skills and preparing a pipeline to search for novel RNAstructures making him a good fit for this project.

Wuhan, China is the epicenter of a rapidly spreading pandemic the World Health Organization (WHO) hasofficially designated as COVID-19. COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, but how it is spread from person toperson is still unclear. The asymptomatic presentation of the disease, and widespread travel out of Wuhan havepermitted its rapid dissemination. As of March 16, 2020, there are over 175,000 cases affecting 162 countrieswith over 6,700 fatalities worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is positive-sense RNA virus infecting vertebrate hosts thatexists in a group of closely related co-evolving entities of which two others – SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV – havecaused recent epidemics. Due to the complexity of anti-viral immunity, experience with other viruses has shownthat swift success in vaccine development is by no means assured. A major challenge is the difficulty inadequately characterizing T cell-mediated recognition of viral epitopes. Finding the major shared specificities inCOVID-19 subjects will help us understand what the most important CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses will be.These findings can be deployed to determine the optimal vaccine formulation so as to elicit these T cellspecificities. We hypothesize that T cell responses to specific epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 will be critical forits control in infected patients across diverse HLA haplotypes, and that a comprehensive mapping ofepitopes recognized by those who clear the virus and their cognate TCRs will facilitate the developmentof the most effective vaccines for COVID-19 treatment. To pursue this hypothesis, we will employ some verynew tools for T cell responses that have recently been developed at Stanford and the Princess Margaret CancerCenter, together with COVID-19 survivors’ blood samples obtained in Toronto, Hong Kong and Stanford.

This supplement requestfor U19AI116484, Stanford Cooperative Center for Novel, Alternative Model Systems for Enteric Diseases(Stanford NAMSED), requests funding to create new models for SARS-CoV-2 infection using novel human lungorganoid technologies in collaboration with Dr. Ralph Baric at UNC, a recognized coronavirus authority. Thesestudies exploit SARS-CoV-2 infection of organoids using a feeder-free, chemically defined human lung organoidsystem (Calvin Kuo lab), lung organoids with integrated immune components (Calvin Kuo), methods for robustapical-basal inversion of lung organoid polarity (Manuel Amieva), BSL3 single cell RNA-seq (Catherine Blish)and SARS-CoV-2-GFP indicator strains and BSL3 facilities (Ralph Baric). The SARS-CoV-2 infection of lungorganoids will occur in BSL3 containment at both UNC and Stanford to compare apical versus basal infectionroutes, document how epithelial infection initiates secondary immune responses, and overall generate improved3D physiological models of SARS-CoV-2-GFP infection relevant to therapeutics screening.

313	UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS	UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS	None	2020-05-06	2021-08-31	Supplement: Exploring the biology of O-acetyl sialic acids using stable synthetic mimics	Exploring the biology of O-acetyl sialic acids using stable synthetic mimicsThis supplement request explores the possibility that sialoglycans may be co-receptors for SARS and COVID-19 virus spike (S) proteins, as is the case with MERS and other Coronaviruses (CoVs). Numerous virusesrecognize host cell surface glycans that terminate in sialic acids (Sias), a family of 9-carbon-backbonemonosaccharides present at very high densities on all vertebrate cell surfaces, and on most secreted proteins––particularly mucins that line and protect mucosal surfaces like the airways. Viral recognition of host sialoglycansis affected by Sia type, linkage to, and the structure of underlying glycans. Much of this natural diversity of Siasin viral infection remains underexplored. While many respiratory disease-causing viruses target Sias, Siarecognition is not currently reported in SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-19 pandemic virus. This stands in contrast tothe extensive literature on Coronaviruses and Sia receptors and is likely because a definitive human proteinreceptor (ACE2) for the virus S protein has been identified. A similar situation existed for the earlier MERS-CoVwhich had a well-defined receptor (DPP4) but was later found to also bind Sias via a different binding site. Giventhe very high Sia density in vivo, and the fact that Sias are the first contact of a virus on a mucosal surface, Siadiversity is likely to play important roles during natural infections. We hypothesize that airway Sias are alsorecognized by S proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. This supplement is based on strong foundationsbuilt by decades of studies of Sia diversity by the collaborating labs, including the parent project which addressesinstability of Sia O-acetyl modifications by synthesizing sialosides with corresponding N-acetyl analogs. Theurgent need for more careful exploration of Sia-binding functions of SARS and MERS will utilize a uniquesialoglycan microarray built up over years of collaboration between the labs. Additional diversity of humansialosides such as those with 9-O-lactyl Sia that have heretofore not been studied, but could be critical, will alsobe explored. We propose sialoglycan microarray studies of recombinant soluble external domains of S proteinsof MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with human CoVs causing milder diseases, todetect Sia-dependent binding that has been missed so far. We will synthesize sialosides containing naturallyoccurring 9-O-lactyl-Sia and more stable 9-N-lactyl analogs and integrate these with the microarray and bindingstudies. Computational studies, including molecular dynamics simulation of binding free energies, willcomplement the array studies by predicting Sia variants that might bind, and modelling binding seen in arraystudies. These studies will generate new knowledge that may help to better understand viral infection,pathogenesis, and transmission from animals to humans and among humans. Additional viral epitopes criticalfor binding neutralization may be identified that could suggest novel preventative and/or therapeutic approachesto COVID-19. This project is therefore well suited to the urgency of the current pandemic situation. Informationlearned can also be applied toward the prediction and prevention of future epidemics and pandemics.

A significant observation is that although this infectionmay result in a self-limiting upper respiratory infection or mild pneumonia in some patients, other patientsexperience progression of respiratory symptoms to requirement of intubation for mechanical respiratorysupport and death due to severe respiratory failure. This clinical observation strongly suggests that differencesin host immunologic response are the determinative factor in clinical outcome. We hypothesize that theproposed systems immunology, biostatistical and computational modeling approaches, coupled with detailedclinical phenotype of hospitalized COVID-19 patients will provide a new framework to interpret the interplaybetween SARS-CoV-2 virus and the host, and the relationship with clinical outcome. Project 1 will assess thefrequency and function of SARS-CoV-2 virus antigen specific T cells and evaluate their breadth and clonalityof their TCR repertoire with clinical outcome. Project 2 will determine epigenetic signatures of the immuneresponse to the SARS-CoV-2 virus across short, middle and long-term times and identify DNA methylation-based markers of anti-viral immunity and clinical outcome. With this approach, we will create a unique resourceof highly annotated longitudinal data on SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, which will enable the development ofnovel diagnostic strategies and therapeutics to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.

Pregnant women and children are notspared but in contrast to other respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV-2 infection does not appear to be more severe inthese groups. Nevertheless, there is considerable concern about transmission from mother to infant particularlyvia breast feeding. Many viral infections such as HIV, CMV, and Ebola are transmitted through breast milk.SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells using the ACE 2 receptor which is present in breast tissue. This increasesconcern that the virus may be present in the breast milk of infected women. Although most children doremarkably well with infection, children &lt;1 year of age have more severe illness with high rates ofhospitalization and admission to the intensive care unit. Therefore, defining the risks of SARS-CoV-2 breastmilk transmission is of critical importance. However, breast milk is not only a potential vector of transmissionbut can be a vehicle of protection by the transfer of protective antibodies and other immune factors. Bothhumoral and cellular immune responses in milk, including milk antibodies to respiratory viruses such asinfluenza, modulate infant disease. In fact, infants less than 6 months of age rely on maternal antibodies toprotect them against influenza and other respiratory viruses. Maternal flu immunization protects infants for atleast 6 months not only against influenza but other febrile illnesses. Whether breast milk contains antibodies toSARS-CoV-2 and whether it modulates the risk of infection to the infant is unknown. Answering thesequestions will require assays to detect the virus and its immune response in milk. We propose to fill thesecritical gaps by validating a quantitative RT-PCR assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in breast milk and thentesting over 100 milk samples from women infected with COVID-19. We will also test heat inactivationprotocols used by breast milk banks to verify that Holder pasteurization destroys SARS-CoV-2. At present,breast milk banks will not accept donations from women who have had COVID-19. As the infection spreadsthis exclusion will limit the availability to sick and vulnerable infants. Finally, we will develop an assay to detectantibodies to SARS-CoV-2 expressed in breast milk and compare those to the antibodies present in maternalblood.

These proposed studies are a naturaland focused extension of the work we are performing in the parent U19 award adapted to the urgentmedical need to better understand the pathogenesis of severe, life-threatening COVID-19 disease.We propose 5 site-specific studies that are highly complementary to assays being performed by theIMPACC national immunophenotyping cores here at UCSF and elsewhere. These include studiesthat focus on both airway cells and blood immune cells (including neutrophils) and utilize a set ofinnovative methods that allow for a detailed understanding of the nature and activation states ofspecific cell types within the airway and the blood. These studies promise to yield new insightsrelevant for understanding COVID-19 immunopathogenesis and predicting disease outcome andresponse to therapy, and could lead to novel therapeutic targets for this devastating disease.

Composed of dedicated experts in medicine, publichealth, industrial hygiene, epidemiology and education, the Texas-Utah Consortium advances theNational Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Worker Training Program's objective to reduce work-related harm and improve disaster preparedness and response.The Texas-Utah Consortium serves as a resource for workers, responders, and residents across thecountry with a targeted focus on the population of United States Department of Health and HumanServices Public Health Regions 5, 6, and 8. In this supplemental application, the Consortium proposes toreduce and prevent occupational exposures to COVID-19 in workers responding to the pandemic and inworkers returning to the physical worksite. The Consortium will accomplish this by creating a portfolio ofonline training courses that are practical, specific, rooted in sound public health principles, and basedon current scientific knowledge relating to COVID-19. The Consortium places special emphasis ontraining workers in the essential services that are critical to maintaining the nation's infrastructure.Additionally, this training is responsive to the changing needs of employees returning to the physicalworksite. Consortium experts will work with instructional developers to adjust current curricula andcreate new course content in response to current crisis standards and stockpile shortages.Building on past successes and using evidence-based teaching techniques, the Consortium projectstraining about 500 workers within a 10-week project period. The public health impact of the Texas-UtahConsortium is a knowledgeable workforce and community with the skills and confidence to recognize andmitigate COVID-19 exposures in the workplace.

The 21stcentury is now experiencing its third outbreak of a novel pathogenic coronavirus that has crossed from ananimal host into humans for the first time. The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is unprecedented among humancoronaviruses in its size and the speed of its spread. Countering this viral outbreak will require a detailedmechanistic understanding of virus protein function. The goals of this project are to gain highly detailedinformation about the SARS-CoV-2 replication complex using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. We willuse this high-resolution imaging technique to determine structures of the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase complexbound to substrates and small molecule antiviral drugs. We will complement these structural analyses with adetailed biochemical study of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions and the influence of theseinteractions on SARS-CoV-2 polymerase activity. These studies include mutagenesis of key interfaces in theprotein complex and testing of the recombinant proteins in polymerase activity assays. These studies have thepotential to illuminate the mechanisms used by the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase complex to replicate its viralgenome and provide a mechanistic understanding of antiviral therapeutic action key to the development ofnovel antiviral therapeutics to treat COVID-19.

320	WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY	WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY	None	2020-05-22	2022-07-31	The Role of Group 3 Innate Lymphoid cells (ILC3) in Tuberculosis	Over the past three months, COVID-19 has emerged as a major pandemic with over ~ 1.9 million productiveinfections and ~100,000 deaths due to infection with the novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, a viral pathogenwhich is highly infectious and pathogenic. This is particularly true in the elderly and people withimmunocompromising conditions who are exhibiting acute respiratory distress syndrome at a greaterfrequency. Unfortunately, no known cures and vaccines exist. Worse, there were no well-characterized animalmodels of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease till recently. With the limited information on hostinnate immune responses, early reports implicate a role for inflammation in mediating COVID-19 disease. Asan logical extension of ongoing work on innate immune responses in the lung on the parent grant, wehypothesize that similar to tuberculosis (TB), control of SARS-CoV2 will correlate with accumulation of innatelymphoid cells including NK cells in the lung, while inflammation and increased disease will be associated withmyeloid cell accumulation. To test this hypothesis, we will utilize recently acquired banked lung samples from anovel rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 disease developed at the SouthWestNational Primate Research Center (in collaboration with Deepak Kaushal Lab, Co-I on parent grant). Thesenew results from the NHP model indicate that rhesus macaques develop signs of human COVID-19 diseaseincluding pyrexia, dysregulation of complete blood cell counts indicative of viral infection, acute stress markers,and experience cough and weight-loss. This is accompanied by high viral loads in bronchoalveolar lavage(BAL) and lungs, and pneumonia is detected by CT scan as well as grossly at necropsy. Single cell RNAsequencing (scRNA-seq) is just beginning to be applied to the immune system in animal models and humansin both healthy and diseased states. The application of scRNA-seq to COVID-19 samples from macaques isparticularly well-suited, as the immune cells infiltrating the lung that may play roles in the disease are diverse,including virtually all types of lymphocytes (ILCs, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, γδ T cells, NK cells, B cells) andseveral myeloid cell types (monocytes, macrophages and potentially dendritic cells (DCs) and neutrophils(PMNs)). Within each of these subtypes, further heterogeneity exists in terms of cytokine production andtranscription factor expression, such that each subtype may demonstrate further heterogeneity. BecausescRNA-seq can define the transcriptomic heterogeneity of a complex community of cells and assign unbiasedidentity classifications to cell populations, it is optimally suited for application to the study of complexinflammatory disease such as TB and COVID-19. The data obtained and its computational analysis willdelineate the nature of inflammation, especially the role of innate cells such as NK cells and ILCs in COVID-19mediated inflammation. These studies will create new opportunities for identifying therapeutic targets forcontrol of pan-epidemics such as TB and COVID-19.	National Institutes of Health	Research Grant	309206.0 USD
321	WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY	WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY	None	2019-09-30	2021-03-31	3/7: Longitudinal Evaluation of the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on High-Risk New and Expectant Mothers	The COVID-19 pandemic represents the most significant environmental event in living history and is leading tounprecedented social, economic and health consequences. There is an urgent need to longitudinally study theimpact of the pandemic on pregnant women and the care they receive, and to understand the consequences fortheir children's birth outcomes and neurobehavioral development. Importantly, women with pre-existingsubstance use, mental health conditions, and limited economic resources may be at increased risk for the wide-ranging, deleterious sequelae of the pandemic. The proposed project seeks to address these critical gaps bybuilding upon ongoing harmonized research efforts across six geographically-representative sites from the NIHHEALthy Brains and Cognitive Development study (HBCD) initiative, including New York University, OregonHealth Sciences University, Washington University in St. Louis, University of Pittsburgh, Cedars Sinai MedicalCenter, University of Vermont, and Northwestern University. We will enroll pregnant and postpartum women intoa multi-wave study in which we assess medical, economic, psychosocial, and substance use risk acrosspregnancy and the perinatal period, studying associations of these factors to infant neurobehavioral developmentduring the first year of life. Our central hypotheses include: 1) individual variation in perinatal COVID-19 relatedstress leads to differences in birth outcomes, parenting stress, and infant temperament and neurodevelopmentand 2) substance use, mental health, and economic risk enhance susceptibility to negative COVID-19 relatedhealth and psychosocial outcomes. To pursue these aims, prospective longitudinal survey, birth, and postpartumdata will be obtained across a 3-month period in N=100 pregnant and new mothers per site (providing a totalconsortium sample of N=700) to generate individual temporal profiles of COVID-19 related experiences andresponses, comparing outcomes with existing data from maternal-infant cohorts obtained prior to the pandemic.Further, to identify avenues for intervention, will evaluate substance use, poor mental health, and low socialeconomic status as risk factors and coping, agency and utilization of resources as resilience factors that influenceCOVID-19 related maternal stress and child health and neurobehavioral outcomes. The effects of geographiclocation will be used to examine the influence of pandemic severity, variation in local government policies, andresource availability on these outcomes. Finally, we will collect and bank longitudinal perinatal biospecimens inN=40 women per site that will provide a foundation for future studies to evaluate the biological mechanismsthrough which the effects on maternal psychological and physical health influence offspring brain and behavioraldevelopment. Through this analysis of COVID-19 related stress, contextual factors, and child outcomes, we willdevelop comprehensive understanding of effects and modifiers of this event on health outcomes in individualsthat vary in dispositional risk during perinatal life, one of the most sensitive timepoints in human development.

The natural history of COVID-19 is unknown in low-income countries. Wepropose to study a combined cohort of 3,054 adults in Haiti and Tanzania to determine the attack rate ofSARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19, to examine interactions with HIV infection, pulmonarytuberculosis, and hypertension in populations of African descent, and to determine long term cardiaccomplications of COVID-19. Cornell University has collaborated with the Groupe Haitien d’Etude du Sarcomede Kaposi et des Infections Opportunistes (GHESKIO) in Haiti for 38 years and for 15 years with the MwanzaIntervention Trials Unit (MITU) in Tanzania. The proposed emergency supplement leverages thesecollaborations and four established NIH-supported cohorts, which have already been enrolled, to addressNIAID priority areas. The specific aims are:1.To determine the incidence proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the attack rate and risk factorsfor severe COVID-19, in well characterized cohorts of 3,054 adults from low-income communities inHaiti and Tanzania. Starting May 1, 2020 we will conduct monthly telephone interviews with the 3,054participants who are in active follow-up to record symptoms of COVID-19 during the pandemic. Participants willalso be encouraged to telephone us if they develop new symptoms. We have cell phone numbers for allcohort participants and have established procedures for telephone communication. We will also review hospitalrecords, perform verbal autopsies, and grade severity of COVID-19. We have banked sera from all participantscollected in 2016-2019. In September-November 2020 and again in March-May 2021, we will collect follow-upsera and perform serologic testing for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. We will determine theodds for development of severe COVID-19 in participants who had HIV, TB, and hypertension.2. To determine the cardiac complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 1,909 adults with known baselinecardiac function. In 1,909 patients who previously had baseline EKGs and echocardiograms (2016-2019), wewill repeat cardiac echo and EKG in 2021 to quantify the odds for development of incident left ventricularsystolic dysfunction in those who did and did not become SARS-CoV-2 infected. LV function will be quantifiedby global longitudinal strain. We will also determine incidence of right ventricular systolic dysfunction,pulmonary hypertension and segmental wall motion abnormalities by echocardiogram, and new Q-waves andother abnormalities on EKG.Defining viral infection rates and natural history in low-income countries will be critical for future preventioninterventions. Determining risk for people with HIV, TB, and hypertension will improve their care andprevention. Understanding cardiac sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 will improve care for COVID-19 survivors.

323	Dr Thomas Evans	Vaccitech	None	2020-08-01	2021-07-31	Development and manufacture of an improved replication-deficient simian adenoviral vector to prevent COVID-19	The University of Oxford and Vaccitech jointly developed and then exclusively out- licensed a serogroup E chimpanzee adenoviral vector vaccine encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein to AstraZeneca. This vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, given as a single dose, has moved into Phase 2/3 studies in the UK, and in August 2020 begins Phase 3 studies in the US and Brazil. There are concerns that anti-vector immunity to the ChAdOx1 backbone may limit early boosting responses, or even boosts given on a yearly basis. Vaccitech has developed an alternative serogroup C chimeric gorilla adenoviral vector vaccine (“GAdVac”), which has been shown in completed murine studies to elicit higher antibody and T cell immune responses than the ChAdOx1 candidates. Vaccitech is now developing the full-length spike glycoprotein encoding GAdVac candidate and will use this as both a stand-alone vaccine and evaluate the use of this candidate as a prime and a boost for the ChAdOx1 platform. Efficacy studies in ferrets will be pursued with Public Health England at Porton Down. The pre-master virus seed will be produced in the SOP- controlled Early Development Laboratories at Vaccitech in Oxford, and then transferred to Advent (Rome, Italy) for GMP manufacture. Advent has successfully made three GMP released lots of ChAdOx1 vectors for Vaccitech. Scientific advice will be sought from MHRA, and a formal GLP toxicology study will be performed due to the novelty of this vector. Within 12 months, the CTA to begin a Phase 1 immunogenicity study will be complete.	Medical Research Council	P&Cs	77914.0 GBP

Its successful management by governments and other international agencies will require statistical tools for real-time monitoring of the evolution of the pandemic over space and time. The aims of this project are to develop statistical tools and software for real-time covid-19 surveillance using georeferenced and time-stamped data from covid-19 cases or testing programmes. To summarise our statistical approach, we assume that across our area of interest there is an underlying, unobserved prevalence of people who have had the disease. At a single time-point we observe spatially-referenced data, which may include only cases from routine hospital records, or testing data with dichotomous outcomes. Where the data provide both numerators and denominators we will use the binomial generalised geostatistical model. Where only numerators are available we will use a Poisson approximation to the binomial with small-area population counts as offsets. We will including a set of spatially varying-covariates, and the unobserved process which is specified as a spatio-temporal Gaussian process. The outputs of our analyses will be predictions of incidence, cumulative incidence, and the effective reproductive rate (the "R number") and their spatial distribution. The output will identify areas where there is a high probability of high reproductive rates (R>1, for example). Unbiased estimates of prevalence at a particular point in time from nationwide testing programmes will be used to correct for the spatial biases that may result from the use of routine, non-randomised data. We will also provide functionality to support random sampling schemes.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	34661.0 GBP

There are 2 objectives: 1. Develop and externally validate prognostic models for i) the composite outcome of ITU admission and/or mechanical ventilation, and ii) death in a UK secondary care setting. 2. Identify distinct clusters based on biomarkers in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and map prognostic trajectories in these patient groups, particularly with respect to progression to requiring ITU admission, ventilation or death. Design: Retrospective cohort analyses using routinely collected secondary care data. For both the prognostic models and cluster analysis participants will all be followed from index (COVID-19 test) date until the earliest of outcome date or study end (latest available data). Patients will be censored 30 days after index date. Study population: Hospitalised patients of all ages diagnosed with COVID-19 (defined as a positive test result from one or more RT-PCR test). Primary outcomes: Prognostic models: i) A composite outcome of ITU admission and/or mechanical ventilation; and ii) death. Cluster analysis: Clinically useful clusters of indicators and associated prognosis: probability of ITU admission, mechanical ventilation or death. We will also explore whether clustering gives valuable information on potential clinical course of the illness, for example if it resulted in myocardial involvement, thromboembolic events, gastrointestinal symptoms and severe pneumonia. Candidate predictors for the prognostic model: Predictors will be explored based on availability of data and existing evidence/biological plausibility. These will include: demographic characteristics; symptoms; frailty; vitals; biomarkers; radiography; physiological tests; and medications/treatments.

This iscomplicated by the observation that many virologically-confirmed cases in children are asymptomatic. Homeenvironments are established sources of exposure that exacerbate symptoms of asthma and home-basedinterventions are proven effective. Prior to the inception of the School Inner-City Asthma Study (SICAS-1), noAmerican study had comprehensively evaluated the relationship between urban exposures in school,classroom, and home environments and asthma morbidity. Nearly all elementary school children spend 7 to12 hours a day in school, and most of that time is spent in one classroom. From SICAS-1, we learned thatstudent classroom-specific mouse allergen, mold, and particulate pollutant exposure is associated withworsening symptoms. We also demonstrated our ability to reduce these exposures in a busy, school setting.Our proposal builds upon our established, successful school-based infrastructure to determine whether aschool/classroom intervention will efficiently and effectively improve asthma morbidity by reducing theseexposures. Our goal is to determine the efficacy of school/classroom based environmental intervention inreducing asthma morbidity in urban schoolchildren. Our central hypothesis is that reducing classroom/schoolexposure to mouse allergen, mold, and particulate pollutants will decrease asthma morbidity in students withasthma. We plan to test this hypothesis in an intervention study of 250 elementary students with asthma frommultiple classrooms in 40 Boston inner-city elementary schools. Our clinical trial aims are to determine theeffectiveness of a school/classroom based environmental intervention (school integrated pest managementand classroom air purifying filter units within these schools) to reduce asthma morbidity. The supplement tothe parent grant is to leverage the cohort for the to participate in the multi-center survey entitled HumanEpidemiology and Response to SARS-CoV-2 (HEROS), study. This study can be rapidly implemented andrealistically conducted without necessitating any visits to a clinical research center. In addition to the need forsurveying children for asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, this study will allow a comparison betweenchildren with asthma and other atopic conditions and children without those conditions through remote surveysand collection of samples. This study is an unprecedented, high impact opportunity to leverage the parent trialwith in scope in understanding how SARS-C0V-2 differentially affects children with the condition of interest,compared to children without it.

While these extreme interventions are effective in slowing transmission of the disease, it isnot clear how they can best be implemented and how other local factors (such as population density, agestructure, timing in the outbreak, and smoking prevalence) might impact their efficacy. We are building a globaldatabase of these interventions in order to more carefully explore these questions and allow other researchersto use this data in their research. We will create models to better understand how NPI impact diseasetransmission and how the local context effects the impact of these NPI. We are working with colleagues in NYC,Spain, and Italy with more granular data to better explore these problems. We aim to develop a framework thatis applicable to widely available case notification data.As the disease spreads to vulnerable populations, such as people experiencing homelessness, persons livingwith HIV (PLWH) and TB, we anticipate that the impact on these populations will be more severe and with a higher force of infection. We will are involved in an effort to build a COVID-19 patient data warehouse at BostonMedical Center, the largest safety net hospital in New England. This will also include COVID-19 treatment andtesting data from Boston Healthcare for the Homeless. We will use this data to study the impact of COVID-19 onthese vulnerable populations. We will also leverage our strong relationships with collaborators in South Africa,the Philippines, and Ukraine, where the prevalence of these conditions is much higher, in order to better elucidatetransmission patterns and impact in the developing world. We will estimate the impact of potential treatmentdisruptions due to the pandemic response on HIV and TB populations.	National Institutes of Health	Research Grant	307029.0 USD
328	CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY	Case Western Reserve University	None	2020-06-01	2020-11-30	Case Clinical Trials Unit: Administrative Supplement NOSI AI-20-031.	The primary objective of this supplemental application is to rapidly enhance the ability of the twodomestic CRSs in the Case Clinical Trials Unit to enroll and follow participants in COVID-19 preventionand treatment trials, with a particular emphasis on enhancing the sites’ capacity to collect, process,store, and ship longitudinal biological specimens from these participants at any stage of the diseaseprocess. The following specific aims are proposed to accomplish this objective:Specific aim 1: To expand CRS capacity to identify new SARS-CoV-2 infections and to offer participationin clinical trials and observational studies. A key element to contribute meaningfully to prevention andtreatment trials will be to have access to recently diagnosed persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection who canbe offered participation. Here, we will enhance the capacity of the two CRSs to access these potentialparticipants by establishing partnerships with central laboratory leadership and expanding support forresearch staff who can support expanded testing and offer participation in research early after diagnosis.Specific aim 2: To improve CRS infrastructure to facilitate specimen collection and longitudinal follow-up of SARS-CoV-2 infected study participants. Among the challenges to refashion the CRSs to conductCOVID-19 trials are limitations in access to secure facilities and personal protection equipment. To addressthis, dedicated protective enclosures will be established at the Case CRS, and dedicated PPE will beacquired where needed for the duration of this funding period, which will be the critical interval duringwhich supply bottlenecks are anticipated to persist.Specific aim 3: To enhance participation of at-risk and SARS-CoV-2-infected persons in clinical researchprotocols. Recruitment of at-risk and infected participants into COVID-19 trials will require novelstrategies to reach out into the community, and to engage potential participants into clinical researchdespite no existing connection to the CRSs. To overcome these obstacles, we will devote dedicated effortfrom outreach coordinators specifically to COVID-19 recruitment, and establish online advertisementcampaigns to maximize opportunities for enrollment.Specific aim 4: To increase CRS capacity for processing and storage of biological specimens from COVID-19 research participants. The final barrier to processing, storing, and archiving specimens from COVID-19prevention and treatment clinical trials is the need for enhanced biosafety precautions in the processinglaboratory. At both CRSs, enhanced BSL-2 workstations will be established, with dedicated equipmentwhen needed, to increase the ability to process efficiently specimens derived from COVID-19 trials.

This new human pathogen is genetically, antigenically andphenotypically distinct from coronaviruses that circulate seasonally in humans and causesymptoms of the common cold. SARS-CoV-2 therefore presents many unknowns. To contributeto what we hope will be a broad effort on the part of the global infectious diseases community, wepropose herein to generate critical reagents that will facilitate research efforts and accelerateprogress toward filling critical knowledge gaps. Namely, we propose the construction of aninfectious molecular clone of the GA-83E strain of SARS-CoV-2 and derivatives thereofexpressing fluorescent and luciferase-based reporter genes. An infectious molecular clone, orreverse genetics system, is an extremely powerful tool which allows the generation of viralvariants carrying targeted mutations. This capability will accelerate progress toward criticalresearch goals. For example, the use of variant viruses carrying reporter genes can greatlystreamline identification of small molecule inhibitors and the titration of immune sera andmonoclonal antibodies. Similarly, the ability to introduce targeted mutations is invaluable in effortsto map antigenic sites, identify escape mutations, map determinants of transmission andvirulence, and identify viral features important for zoonotic potential. In sum, the reagent-generation effort outlined herein is designed to rapidly furnish the emerging SARS-CoV-2 fieldwith an essential tool of modern virology.

Currently available data are limited because the impact of asymptomatic and mildlysymptomatic cases is unclear and many people are unable to access a test due to rationing, or may beotherwise unwilling to go for testing or care. This study will address this problem by conducting a nationalprobability sample, where each address may be selected by chance, to develop estimates of the proportion ofadults in the United States that are infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, and the proportion that hashad the disease in the past and may now have immunity. We will use home-based testing techniques tofacilitate participation in this national study. We will also use surveys to better understand participants in oursample. With these estimates, we will conduct disease modeling to understand different scenarios of theepidemic. We will also develop a website to provide information and data to the public.

None	2018-04-01	2021-06-30	Novel Arm Restraint For Critically Ill Patients To Reduce Immobility, Sedation, Agitation and Cognitive Impairment	The goal of this Administrative Supplement to Parent Grant R42AG059451 in response to responsive to PAS-17-065 is to allow mass production of a novel device to provide relief to critically ill patients affected by thesedation shortage resultant from the COVID-19 pandemic. Through access to plastic injection molding,assembly and logistics, Healthy Design will be able to realize an acceptable time frame to produce, makeavailable and support the use of its novel medical device. Healthy Design expects that streamlining productionwill minimize sedation usage while minimizing restraint, agitation, and delirium and increasing mobility withoutextra staff or other valuable resources.The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a ripple effect in our ICU supply chain, not the least of which is asedation shortage. We are conserving as much as possible by utilizing the less expensive and more abundantmedications from the benzodiazepine sedative category which were until now discouraged by published ICUguidelines; however, these supplies are also rapidly depleting. In the ICU setting, sedation is required forconfused patients with vital medical equipment, restrained intubated patients, patients with severe acute lungdisease resulting in ventilator dyssynchrony, and for those dyssynchronous patients who require a paralytic.While all of these categories of illness include COVID and non-COVID patients, in order to reserve sedation forthe most needy patients, we must reduce sedation for other patients. The Exersides™ Refraint™ was createdto safely reduce the need for sedation by reducing restraint and agitation. As immobility, agitation and sedationare known to lead to delirium and post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), there will likely be further benefits ofthe device. Thus far, Exersides™ has successfully completed a preliminary Pilot Study, a Phase I trial and,except for the COVID-related trial suspension, is currently in its multi-site Phase II trial as part of this STTRFast-Track award.Another phenomenon we are facing due to the current pandemic is an almost complete absence of familyvisitation. Together with an overstretched ICU staff, this loss is leading to patients spending more time alonewhile critically ill. Lack of availability to attend to each patient actually encourages increased sedation andrestraint in an attempt to keep everyone safe while caring for more patients. Exersides™ is intended to keepvital tubes and lines safe while allowing thoracic movement for pulmonary secretion clearance, gut functionand muscle tone preservation. Physicians are realizing they will be making difficult choices as to whether it ishumane to place a critically ill patient on a ventilator and strap them to the bed while awake. From our trials todate, we work with nurses and physicians who are familiar with Exersides™ and understand the concept of asafe, alone, awake, mobile intubated patient.The pathway to Healthy Design’s ultimate goal of making the Exersides™ Refraint™ available to all hospitalsin time to address the concerns forced upon us by the sedation shortages is clear.

It is impacting everyone's lives,as well as crippling the global economy, health care systems, and more. The disease is caused by the SevereAcute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pathogen, and it appears to exert its mostdevastating effects on people's respiratory and pulmonary systems although recent reports have also citedcardiac complications in otherwise healthy individuals. Based on analyzed data from confirmed cases in theUnited States between February 12th and March 28th, the CentersforDiseaseControlandPreventiondisclosed that people with substance use disorders such as those with histories of smoking, as well as thosewith diabetes, chronic lung disease, and heart disease may be at increased risk of developing severecomplications from COVID-19. Considering the prevalence of these health conditions in the United States, theglobal COVID-19 cases approaching 1 million at the time of this writing, the alarming COVID-19 projections forthe month of April, the likelihood that COVID-19 becomes seasonal, and the fast pace at which SARS-CoVpathogens evolve into forms with higher cross-species transmission and/or higher affinity for human receptors,theredoctorsagainstagainstis no doubt that the scientific world must mobilize to offer as many solutions as possible to help medicaland health care providers save lives. Among these solutions, are suggestions for new medicationsCOVID-19, considering repurposed or may not prove effectiveCOVID-19. against drugs in clinical trials mayIn this application, we propose to expand the range of potential medicationsthat currentlyCOVID-19 using a rational, structure-based drug discovery approach focused on the virus-receptor recognitionmechanism, which regulates its infection, pathogenesis, and host range.

Vulnerable populations, such as peoplewho use drugs (PWUD), are particularly susceptible both to severe COVID-19 illness as well as health andwell-being consequences associated with the secondary impacts of the COVID-19 epidemic.PWUD are at higher risk of COVID-19 due to high levels of comorbid health conditions and high incidence ofrespiratory impairment due to cigarette smoking. The health of PWUD are also influenced by social policiesand practices implemented as part of COVID-19 response strategies. For example, COVID-19 socialdistancing measures and hospital access restrictions may reduce PWUD's ability to obtain HIV, HCV, andother types of critical health and social services. Those who are on medication assisted treatment may be atrisk for treatment disruptions, and those who attend self-help groups such as NA and AA may be unable toattend meeting or see their sponsors. Engagement in COVID-19 prevention measures may also be moredifficult for PWUD. High rates of homelessness and unstable housing among PWUD, may prohibit their abilityto 'stay in place'. As they may have no place to stay. Unstable sources of income and effort to avoidwithdrawal symptoms may lead PWUD to more frequent interactions with others and less social distancing, aswell as more frequent sharing of injection equipment. As COVID-19 is a novel disease and massive socialchanges have been implemented, which have not been utilized since the influenza epidemic of 1918, there isscant literature to aid us in predicting the long and short-term impacts of COVID-19 among PWUD.Consequently, we propose to conduct a mixed methods study that would entail frequent (bi-weekly) qualitativeassessments of a sample of PWUD and a quantitative survey. We propose these frequent qualitativeinterviews as the situation may change rapidly depending on the epidemic dynamics.The parent grant (R01DA040488) is an RCT to improve HIV and HCV health outcomes and reduce HIV, HCV,and drug overdose risk behaviors among people who inject drugs (index participants) and their social networkmembers.

Although the SARS coronaviruses are “respiratory” viruses, they are also neuro-invasive, and neurological signs are common (Desforges et al 2014). Since AUD has increased markedly in the COVID-19 pandemic, and also causes neurotoxicity, there is a clear potential for enhanced neurological sequelae of infection by SARS CoV-2 in patients with AUD. One neurotoxic mechanism of coronaviruses is “excitotoxicity” via activation of NMDA receptors (Brison et al, 2014), and this is also a mechanism for neurotoxicity in AWD. This parallels neurotoxicity associated with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in which the cleaved viral coat protein, Tat, causes excitotoxicity, which is enhanced by AWD (Self et al 2004). Since JR220 is an inhibitory modulator of the NMDA receptor, and inhibits AWD-induced neurotoxicity, it should inhibit any enhancement of coronavirus or HIV neurotoxicity caused by AWD, and may inhibit viral neurotoxicity itself. The closest analog of HIV Tat in SARS CoV-2 is the spike protein (SP) subunit that is cleaved from the virus after internalization, and accumulates in neurons. The first specific aim is to test this SP subunit protein, and later other SARS CoV-2 coat proteins, for neurotoxic damage in organotypic hippocampal cultures (OHCs), either alone or during AWD. The second specific aim is to test JR220 for protection against SARS CoV-2 protein or HIV Tat-induced neurotoxicity in OHCs, with or without concomitant AWD. The predictions are that JR220 will prevent enhancement of viral protein neurotoxicity associated with AWD, and may also inhibit SARS CoV-2 protein and HIV Tat neurotoxicity. This proposal is directly relevant to clinical treatment of AUD during COVID-19. It should also identify important new indications for JR220, and strengthen the IP and commercial potential of this drug.	National Institutes of Health	Research Grant	794605.0 USD

COVID-19 cases in the New York City (NYC) tri-statearea continue to rise exponentially and the region is now the epicenter of the crisis in the United States. InNYC alone, there are over 21,000 cases (~40% ≥40 years of age) as of March 26, 2020. Many symptomaticCOVID-19 patients have features of a cytokine storm and/or macrophage activation syndrome, includingelevated levels of interleukin (IL)-6. An overly robust local neutrophil influx may also contribute to the robustimmune response with associated severe cardiopulmonary complications, including acute respiratory distresssyndrome requiring mechanical ventilation and myocarditis with cardiogenic shock. Colchicine is a safe, well-tolerated anti-inflammatory agent that suppresses the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby blockingconversion of pro-IL-1β to active IL-1β, which leads to secondary reductions in other cytokines including IL-6along with inhibition of macrophage activation. Colchicine also preferentially accumulates in neutrophilscompared with other inflammatory cells and inhibits chemotaxis, endothelial adhesion, and extravasation ofneutrophils at sites of endothelial or tissue inflammation. The effects of colchicine in preventing the cytokinestorm and/or macrophage activation syndrome that leads to clinical deterioration in COVID-19, however, is notknown. Colchicine is not known to inhibit acquired immunity, and is not contraindicated in patients withinfection.The COLCORONA study is a Canadian government-funded randomized trial of colchicine vs. placebo for 30days in 6,000 non-hospitalized subjects 40 years of age with COVID-19 diagnosis and at least one high-riskcriterion. This proposal leverages the COLCORONA Trial infrastructure and pragmatic study design with virtualconsent, randomization, and follow-up to rapidly implement the COLCORONA-NYC Study and allow potentialeligible subjects in the NYC tri-state area to participate. The overall aim of the study is to determine the effectof colchicine on the composite of death or the need for hospitalization in non-hospitalized adults with COVID-19. The data collected through the COLCORONA-NYC study will provide novel data on treatment of COVID-19patients, and have public health implications beyond the scope of the current application, including thepotential reduction in the healthcare resources heavily used in COVID-19 (e.g., hospital beds, ventilators), andpotential future use in other infectious causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome.

One isrigorous ribozyme mechanism and the other is discovery-based RNA structural genomics. A major goal of theparent award is to bridge these two areas to discover new RNA biology and to characterize it at the molecularlevel. This proposal advances ways to investigate RNA structure and its contribution to the COVID-19outbreak. We have already computationally identified structural domains in the RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2,which causes COVID-19, and confirmed these with recent reports on BioRxiv. Uniquely, we identified potentialpseudoknots, which are regions of RNA folding complexity that are typically essential for function. The plan forthe summer is for our undergraduate student Peter Forstmeier to work through the thousands of availableSARS-CoV-2 genomes that contain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify changes in pseudoknotstrength and RNA folding. SNPs in pseudoknots may lead to changes in the stability of the structure, as so-called riboSNitches. The effect of these SNPs on pseudoknots may have implications on the spread andpotential virulence of COVID-19. Our hypothesis is that such information will provide targets for therapeutics,both antisense oligonucleotides and small molecules, which can halt spread of the virus. This administrativesupplement would provide a unique opportunity for Peter to advance his training to pursue his eventual goal ofbeing a physician-scientist. Because it is computational, it is amenable to working from home during thepandemic, and we can mentor Peter using videoconferencing. Peter is a rising junior and has already spent ayear in the Bevilacqua lab developing his coding skills and preparing a pipeline to search for novel RNAstructures making him a good fit for this project.

Wuhan, China is the epicenter of a rapidly spreading pandemic the World Health Organization (WHO) hasofficially designated as COVID-19. COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, but how it is spread from person toperson is still unclear. The asymptomatic presentation of the disease, and widespread travel out of Wuhan havepermitted its rapid dissemination. As of March 16, 2020, there are over 175,000 cases affecting 162 countrieswith over 6,700 fatalities worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is positive-sense RNA virus infecting vertebrate hosts thatexists in a group of closely related co-evolving entities of which two others – SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV – havecaused recent epidemics. Due to the complexity of anti-viral immunity, experience with other viruses has shownthat swift success in vaccine development is by no means assured. A major challenge is the difficulty inadequately characterizing T cell-mediated recognition of viral epitopes. Finding the major shared specificities inCOVID-19 subjects will help us understand what the most important CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses will be.These findings can be deployed to determine the optimal vaccine formulation so as to elicit these T cellspecificities. We hypothesize that T cell responses to specific epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 will be critical forits control in infected patients across diverse HLA haplotypes, and that a comprehensive mapping ofepitopes recognized by those who clear the virus and their cognate TCRs will facilitate the developmentof the most effective vaccines for COVID-19 treatment. To pursue this hypothesis, we will employ some verynew tools for T cell responses that have recently been developed at Stanford and the Princess Margaret CancerCenter, together with COVID-19 survivors’ blood samples obtained in Toronto, Hong Kong and Stanford.

This supplement requestfor U19AI116484, Stanford Cooperative Center for Novel, Alternative Model Systems for Enteric Diseases(Stanford NAMSED), requests funding to create new models for SARS-CoV-2 infection using novel human lungorganoid technologies in collaboration with Dr. Ralph Baric at UNC, a recognized coronavirus authority. Thesestudies exploit SARS-CoV-2 infection of organoids using a feeder-free, chemically defined human lung organoidsystem (Calvin Kuo lab), lung organoids with integrated immune components (Calvin Kuo), methods for robustapical-basal inversion of lung organoid polarity (Manuel Amieva), BSL3 single cell RNA-seq (Catherine Blish)and SARS-CoV-2-GFP indicator strains and BSL3 facilities (Ralph Baric). The SARS-CoV-2 infection of lungorganoids will occur in BSL3 containment at both UNC and Stanford to compare apical versus basal infectionroutes, document how epithelial infection initiates secondary immune responses, and overall generate improved3D physiological models of SARS-CoV-2-GFP infection relevant to therapeutics screening.

340	UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS	UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS	None	2020-05-06	2021-08-31	Supplement: Exploring the biology of O-acetyl sialic acids using stable synthetic mimics	Exploring the biology of O-acetyl sialic acids using stable synthetic mimicsThis supplement request explores the possibility that sialoglycans may be co-receptors for SARS and COVID-19 virus spike (S) proteins, as is the case with MERS and other Coronaviruses (CoVs). Numerous virusesrecognize host cell surface glycans that terminate in sialic acids (Sias), a family of 9-carbon-backbonemonosaccharides present at very high densities on all vertebrate cell surfaces, and on most secreted proteins––particularly mucins that line and protect mucosal surfaces like the airways. Viral recognition of host sialoglycansis affected by Sia type, linkage to, and the structure of underlying glycans. Much of this natural diversity of Siasin viral infection remains underexplored. While many respiratory disease-causing viruses target Sias, Siarecognition is not currently reported in SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-19 pandemic virus. This stands in contrast tothe extensive literature on Coronaviruses and Sia receptors and is likely because a definitive human proteinreceptor (ACE2) for the virus S protein has been identified. A similar situation existed for the earlier MERS-CoVwhich had a well-defined receptor (DPP4) but was later found to also bind Sias via a different binding site. Giventhe very high Sia density in vivo, and the fact that Sias are the first contact of a virus on a mucosal surface, Siadiversity is likely to play important roles during natural infections. We hypothesize that airway Sias are alsorecognized by S proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. This supplement is based on strong foundationsbuilt by decades of studies of Sia diversity by the collaborating labs, including the parent project which addressesinstability of Sia O-acetyl modifications by synthesizing sialosides with corresponding N-acetyl analogs. Theurgent need for more careful exploration of Sia-binding functions of SARS and MERS will utilize a uniquesialoglycan microarray built up over years of collaboration between the labs. Additional diversity of humansialosides such as those with 9-O-lactyl Sia that have heretofore not been studied, but could be critical, will alsobe explored. We propose sialoglycan microarray studies of recombinant soluble external domains of S proteinsof MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with human CoVs causing milder diseases, todetect Sia-dependent binding that has been missed so far. We will synthesize sialosides containing naturallyoccurring 9-O-lactyl-Sia and more stable 9-N-lactyl analogs and integrate these with the microarray and bindingstudies. Computational studies, including molecular dynamics simulation of binding free energies, willcomplement the array studies by predicting Sia variants that might bind, and modelling binding seen in arraystudies. These studies will generate new knowledge that may help to better understand viral infection,pathogenesis, and transmission from animals to humans and among humans. Additional viral epitopes criticalfor binding neutralization may be identified that could suggest novel preventative and/or therapeutic approachesto COVID-19. This project is therefore well suited to the urgency of the current pandemic situation. Informationlearned can also be applied toward the prediction and prevention of future epidemics and pandemics.

A significant observation is that although this infectionmay result in a self-limiting upper respiratory infection or mild pneumonia in some patients, other patientsexperience progression of respiratory symptoms to requirement of intubation for mechanical respiratorysupport and death due to severe respiratory failure. This clinical observation strongly suggests that differencesin host immunologic response are the determinative factor in clinical outcome. We hypothesize that theproposed systems immunology, biostatistical and computational modeling approaches, coupled with detailedclinical phenotype of hospitalized COVID-19 patients will provide a new framework to interpret the interplaybetween SARS-CoV-2 virus and the host, and the relationship with clinical outcome. Project 1 will assess thefrequency and function of SARS-CoV-2 virus antigen specific T cells and evaluate their breadth and clonalityof their TCR repertoire with clinical outcome. Project 2 will determine epigenetic signatures of the immuneresponse to the SARS-CoV-2 virus across short, middle and long-term times and identify DNA methylation-based markers of anti-viral immunity and clinical outcome. With this approach, we will create a unique resourceof highly annotated longitudinal data on SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, which will enable the development ofnovel diagnostic strategies and therapeutics to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.

Pregnant women and children are notspared but in contrast to other respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV-2 infection does not appear to be more severe inthese groups. Nevertheless, there is considerable concern about transmission from mother to infant particularlyvia breast feeding. Many viral infections such as HIV, CMV, and Ebola are transmitted through breast milk.SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells using the ACE 2 receptor which is present in breast tissue. This increasesconcern that the virus may be present in the breast milk of infected women. Although most children doremarkably well with infection, children &lt;1 year of age have more severe illness with high rates ofhospitalization and admission to the intensive care unit. Therefore, defining the risks of SARS-CoV-2 breastmilk transmission is of critical importance. However, breast milk is not only a potential vector of transmissionbut can be a vehicle of protection by the transfer of protective antibodies and other immune factors. Bothhumoral and cellular immune responses in milk, including milk antibodies to respiratory viruses such asinfluenza, modulate infant disease. In fact, infants less than 6 months of age rely on maternal antibodies toprotect them against influenza and other respiratory viruses. Maternal flu immunization protects infants for atleast 6 months not only against influenza but other febrile illnesses. Whether breast milk contains antibodies toSARS-CoV-2 and whether it modulates the risk of infection to the infant is unknown. Answering thesequestions will require assays to detect the virus and its immune response in milk. We propose to fill thesecritical gaps by validating a quantitative RT-PCR assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in breast milk and thentesting over 100 milk samples from women infected with COVID-19. We will also test heat inactivationprotocols used by breast milk banks to verify that Holder pasteurization destroys SARS-CoV-2. At present,breast milk banks will not accept donations from women who have had COVID-19. As the infection spreadsthis exclusion will limit the availability to sick and vulnerable infants. Finally, we will develop an assay to detectantibodies to SARS-CoV-2 expressed in breast milk and compare those to the antibodies present in maternalblood. Information about maternal transfer of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies to the infant is a high priority toinform both breastfeeding practices and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination strategies.

This is particularly true in the elderly and people withimmunocompromising conditions who are exhibiting acute respiratory distress syndrome at a greaterfrequency. Unfortunately, no known cures and vaccines exist. Worse, there were no well-characterized animalmodels of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease till recently. With the limited information on hostinnate immune responses, early reports implicate a role for inflammation in mediating COVID-19 disease. Asan logical extension of ongoing work on innate immune responses in the lung on the parent grant, wehypothesize that similar to tuberculosis (TB), control of SARS-CoV2 will correlate with accumulation of innatelymphoid cells including NK cells in the lung, while inflammation and increased disease will be associated withmyeloid cell accumulation. To test this hypothesis, we will utilize recently acquired banked lung samples from anovel rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 disease developed at the SouthWestNational Primate Research Center (in collaboration with Deepak Kaushal Lab, Co-I on parent grant). Thesenew results from the NHP model indicate that rhesus macaques develop signs of human COVID-19 diseaseincluding pyrexia, dysregulation of complete blood cell counts indicative of viral infection, acute stress markers,and experience cough and weight-loss. This is accompanied by high viral loads in bronchoalveolar lavage(BAL) and lungs, and pneumonia is detected by CT scan as well as grossly at necropsy. Single cell RNAsequencing (scRNA-seq) is just beginning to be applied to the immune system in animal models and humansin both healthy and diseased states. The application of scRNA-seq to COVID-19 samples from macaques isparticularly well-suited, as the immune cells infiltrating the lung that may play roles in the disease are diverse,including virtually all types of lymphocytes (ILCs, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, γδ T cells, NK cells, B cells) andseveral myeloid cell types (monocytes, macrophages and potentially dendritic cells (DCs) and neutrophils(PMNs)). Within each of these subtypes, further heterogeneity exists in terms of cytokine production andtranscription factor expression, such that each subtype may demonstrate further heterogeneity. BecausescRNA-seq can define the transcriptomic heterogeneity of a complex community of cells and assign unbiasedidentity classifications to cell populations, it is optimally suited for application to the study of complexinflammatory disease such as TB and COVID-19. The data obtained and its computational analysis willdelineate the nature of inflammation, especially the role of innate cells such as NK cells and ILCs in COVID-19mediated inflammation. These studies will create new opportunities for identifying therapeutic targets forcontrol of pan-epidemics such as TB and COVID-19.	National Institutes of Health	Research Grant	309206.0 USD
348	WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY	WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY	None	2019-09-30	2021-03-31	3/7: Longitudinal Evaluation of the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on High-Risk New and Expectant Mothers	The COVID-19 pandemic represents the most significant environmental event in living history and is leading tounprecedented social, economic and health consequences. There is an urgent need to longitudinally study theimpact of the pandemic on pregnant women and the care they receive, and to understand the consequences fortheir children's birth outcomes and neurobehavioral development. Importantly, women with pre-existingsubstance use, mental health conditions, and limited economic resources may be at increased risk for the wide-ranging, deleterious sequelae of the pandemic. The proposed project seeks to address these critical gaps bybuilding upon ongoing harmonized research efforts across six geographically-representative sites from the NIHHEALthy Brains and Cognitive Development study (HBCD) initiative, including New York University, OregonHealth Sciences University, Washington University in St. Louis, University of Pittsburgh, Cedars Sinai MedicalCenter, University of Vermont, and Northwestern University. We will enroll pregnant and postpartum women intoa multi-wave study in which we assess medical, economic, psychosocial, and substance use risk acrosspregnancy and the perinatal period, studying associations of these factors to infant neurobehavioral developmentduring the first year of life. Our central hypotheses include: 1) individual variation in perinatal COVID-19 relatedstress leads to differences in birth outcomes, parenting stress, and infant temperament and neurodevelopmentand 2) substance use, mental health, and economic risk enhance susceptibility to negative COVID-19 relatedhealth and psychosocial outcomes. To pursue these aims, prospective longitudinal survey, birth, and postpartumdata will be obtained across a 3-month period in N=100 pregnant and new mothers per site (providing a totalconsortium sample of N=700) to generate individual temporal profiles of COVID-19 related experiences andresponses, comparing outcomes with existing data from maternal-infant cohorts obtained prior to the pandemic.Further, to identify avenues for intervention, will evaluate substance use, poor mental health, and low socialeconomic status as risk factors and coping, agency and utilization of resources as resilience factors that influenceCOVID-19 related maternal stress and child health and neurobehavioral outcomes. The effects of geographiclocation will be used to examine the influence of pandemic severity, variation in local government policies, andresource availability on these outcomes. Finally, we will collect and bank longitudinal perinatal biospecimens inN=40 women per site that will provide a foundation for future studies to evaluate the biological mechanismsthrough which the effects on maternal psychological and physical health influence offspring brain and behavioraldevelopment. Through this analysis of COVID-19 related stress, contextual factors, and child outcomes, we willdevelop comprehensive understanding of effects and modifiers of this event on health outcomes in individualsthat vary in dispositional risk during perinatal life, one of the most sensitive timepoints in human development.

The natural history of COVID-19 is unknown in low-income countries. Wepropose to study a combined cohort of 3,054 adults in Haiti and Tanzania to determine the attack rate ofSARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19, to examine interactions with HIV infection, pulmonarytuberculosis, and hypertension in populations of African descent, and to determine long term cardiaccomplications of COVID-19. Cornell University has collaborated with the Groupe Haitien d’Etude du Sarcomede Kaposi et des Infections Opportunistes (GHESKIO) in Haiti for 38 years and for 15 years with the MwanzaIntervention Trials Unit (MITU) in Tanzania. The proposed emergency supplement leverages thesecollaborations and four established NIH-supported cohorts, which have already been enrolled, to addressNIAID priority areas. The specific aims are:1.To determine the incidence proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the attack rate and risk factorsfor severe COVID-19, in well characterized cohorts of 3,054 adults from low-income communities inHaiti and Tanzania. Starting May 1, 2020 we will conduct monthly telephone interviews with the 3,054participants who are in active follow-up to record symptoms of COVID-19 during the pandemic. Participants willalso be encouraged to telephone us if they develop new symptoms. We have cell phone numbers for allcohort participants and have established procedures for telephone communication. We will also review hospitalrecords, perform verbal autopsies, and grade severity of COVID-19. We have banked sera from all participantscollected in 2016-2019. In September-November 2020 and again in March-May 2021, we will collect follow-upsera and perform serologic testing for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. We will determine theodds for development of severe COVID-19 in participants who had HIV, TB, and hypertension.2. To determine the cardiac complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 1,909 adults with known baselinecardiac function. In 1,909 patients who previously had baseline EKGs and echocardiograms (2016-2019), wewill repeat cardiac echo and EKG in 2021 to quantify the odds for development of incident left ventricularsystolic dysfunction in those who did and did not become SARS-CoV-2 infected. LV function will be quantifiedby global longitudinal strain. We will also determine incidence of right ventricular systolic dysfunction,pulmonary hypertension and segmental wall motion abnormalities by echocardiogram, and new Q-waves andother abnormalities on EKG.Defining viral infection rates and natural history in low-income countries will be critical for future preventioninterventions. Determining risk for people with HIV, TB, and hypertension will improve their care andprevention. Understanding cardiac sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 will improve care for COVID-19 survivors.

Thesewill feature continuously updated estimates of the reproduction number (number of cases per case)and permit us to assess the benefits of current interventions (social distancing, school closure). We also propose to conduct a close analysis of the fraction of cases traceable to known cases.This statistic can be useful because it can indicate transmission through unknown routes or throughasymptomatic cases, but it can also be influenced by the efficacy of contact tracing itself. Manycases that would have otherwise occurred are caught and prevented by contact tracing and isolation.We will conduct network simulations to determine when large values of this presage epidemic growth(depending on the reproduction number, and timeliness and yield of contact investigation). Finally, we will use detailed network simulation to yield a pandemic preparation road maplooking into the future. Specifically, specific events (rate of increase of cases, large number ofuntraceable cases, cases in varying geographic areas) will yield specific actions (school closures,mass gathering abrogation) despite uncertainty in the mode of transmission. These detailed modelswill also be used for real time assessment of the timing and duration of school closure.	National Institutes of Health	Research Grant	242000.0 USD

A detailed understanding of the risk factors for severe disease, including genetic andenvironmental factors and the nature of the host immunological response, is essential for the development ofprognostic biomarkers and effective therapies. To meet this urgent need we propose to help develop and toparticipate in the IMPACC multi-center longitudinal clinical study of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and toimmunophenotype participants using shared immunological methods that will be designed an carried out bycore laboratories at UCSF and at other participating institutions. Our specific aims are 1) to develop aprospective observational convenience cohort of adult subjects hospitalized with known or presumptiveCOVID-19, 2) to use this cohort to describe the relationship between specific immunologic assessments andclinical course of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients, and 3) to implement three core laboratories at UCSF tosupport immunophenotyping in this multicenter cohort. These core laboratories will perform bulk RNAsequencing of blood peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), bulk metagenomic next-generationsequencing (mNGS) on endotracheal aspirate samples, and serologic phage display assays (PhIP-Seq).Successful completion of these aims will yield critical information regarding the relationship between viral load,host immunological responses, and poor clinical outcomes that are urgently needed for biomarkerdevelopment and rational therapeutic targeting. In addition, the cellular samples banked in this study maydirectly contribute to the development of neutralizing antibodies and vaccine strategies that will be our ultimatedefense against recurrence of this extraordinary pandemic. A rapid and robust scientific and medical responseof the type proposed by the NIAID and the academic community in this consortium is an essential element of abroad response required to protect the health and well-being of all individuals, our health care system, and thebroader social structures that maintain global health and welfare.

This pandemichas benefitted from huge volumes of data being generated, but the rate of dissemination of these data hasoften outpaced existing data pipelines. While the last decade has seen significant advances in real-timeinfectious disease forecasting — spurred by rapid growth in data and computational methods — thesemethods have primarily focused on seasonal endemic diseases based, are based on historical data, and sodo not apply easily to this novel pathogen, or to pandemic scenarios. New methods are needed to leveragethe wealth of surveillance data at fine spatial granularity, together with associated information about policyinterventions and environmental conditions over space and time, to reason directly about the mechanisms toforecast and understand the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. These methods must usesound statistical and epidemiological principles and be flexible and computationally efficient to provide real-time forecasts to guide public health decision-making and respond to changing aspects of this global crisis.The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop scalable, computationally efficient Bayesianhierarchical compartmental models to flexibly respond to state-level public health forecasting needs, and (2)to design models and conduct analyses to draw robust inference about the effectiveness of interventions inimpacting the reproductive rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections within the US to build an evidence-base forcontinued responses to COVID-19 and future pandemics.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus uses human ACE2 to bind to cells, and the host TMPRSS2 protease toprime the viral spike proteins for entry. Three mouse strains expressing human ACE2 as a transgene exist—only one of which is being prepared for distribution in the US and is in high demand under the currentcircumstance. Furthermore, concerns exist about aberrant expression of human ACE2 in these mice, given thelack of normal regulatory elements, and none of the ACE2 transgenic strains express the human TMPRSS2protease, thus cannot be used to assess therapeutic strategies that target the protease. We propose toemploy a novel and rapid gene replacement strategy that we have pioneered, to generate ACE2 andTMPRSS2 gene replacement mice. Our BSL3 experienced team will infect these mice with SARS-CoV-2 inorder to determine if they display the expected viral replication, interstitial pneumonia, inflammatory cytokinestorm, and antibody responses that characterize human COVID-19 disease. Importantly, these mice will beimmediately sent to our partners at Jackson Labs (JAX) for rapid expansion and world-wide distribution.	National Institutes of Health	Research Grant	525989.0 USD

There are experimental drugswhich will be tested; however, there are no approved therapeutics or vaccines. Indeed, there are tests underway todetermine whether remdesivir, which was developed against filoviruses, can be repurposed against SARS-CoV-2infection. It would be transformative if we could identify additional small molecules that could be repurposed to treatthe outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given that the goal of the parent grant (R01AI150246) is to discoverantivirals active against bunyaviruses, based on findings from cell based screening, and that we have broadexpertise in diverse viruses, we are applying for Supplemental funding (notice number NOT-AI-20-030, PA-18-035)to expand the scope of the existing grant to use the same methods (small molecule screening) to identify antiviraltherapeutics active against SARS-CoV-2 infection. We will screen two libraries of known bioactives to potentiallyrepurpose existing therapeutics. First, we will test a library of innate immune agonists (~100 PAMPs) for their abilityto block SARS-CoV-2 infection in human cells including airway cells. Second, we will screen another ‘actionable’library that I have created as the Director of the High-throughput Screening core at UPENN. We created a library of~3000 drugs that includes ~1500 FDA approved compounds, ~1000 drugs in clinical trials and the remaining drugshave known targets. This library has been used for repurposing (as is being done with the Gilead drug remdesivirthat was originally developed against filoviruses) to more rapidly identify active therapeutics for future testing inhumans. We will also determine if any of our active antivirals act synergistically with remdesivir since this drug iscurrently under development for use against COVID-19. We expect to identify additional drugs with activity againstSARS-CoV-2.	National Institutes of Health	Research Grant	111910.0 USD

There is an urgent need to longitudinally study theimpact of the pandemic on pregnant women and the care they receive, and to understand the consequences fortheir children’s birth outcomes and neurobehavioral development. Importantly, women with pre-existingsubstance use, mental health conditions and limited economic resources may be at increased risk for the wide-ranging, deleterious sequelae of the pandemic. The proposed project seeks to address these critical gaps bybuilding upon ongoing harmonized research efforts across seven geographically-representative sites from theNIH HEALthy Brains and Cognitive Development study (HBCD) initiative, including New York University, OregonHealth Sciences University, Washington University in St. Louis, University of Pittsburgh, Cedars Sinai MedicalCenter, University of Vermont and Northwestern University. We will enroll pregnant and postpartum women intoa multi-wave study in which we assess medical, economic, psychosocial and substance use risk acrosspregnancy and the perinatal period, studying associations of these factors to infant neurobehavioral developmentduring the first year of life. Our central hypotheses include: 1) individual variation in perinatal COVID-19 relatedstress leads to differences in birth outcomes, parenting stress and infant temperament and neurodevelopmentand 2) substance use, mental health and economic risk enhance susceptibility to negative COVID-19 relatedhealth and psychosocial outcomes. To pursue these aims, prospective longitudinal survey, birth and postpartumdata will be obtained across a 3-month period in N=100 pregnant and new mothers per site (providing a totalconsortium sample of N=700) to generate individual temporal profiles of COVID-19 related experiences andresponses, comparing outcomes with existing data from maternal-infant cohorts obtained prior to the pandemic.Further, to identify avenues for intervention, will evaluate substance use, poor mental health and lowsocioeconomic status as risk factors and coping, agency and utilization of resources as resilience factors thatinfluence COVID-19 related maternal stress and child health and neurobehavioral outcomes. The effects ofgeographic location will be used to examine the influence of pandemic severity, variation in local governmentpolicies and resource availability on these outcomes. Finally, we will collect and bank longitudinal perinatalbiospecimens in N=40 women per site that will provide a foundation for future studies to evaluate the biologicalmechanisms through which the effects on maternal psychological and physical health influence offspring brainand behavioral development. Through this analysis of COVID-19 related stress, contextual factors and childoutcomes, we will develop a comprehensive understanding of effects and modifiers of this event on healthoutcomes in individuals that vary in dispositional risk during perinatal life, one of the most sensitive timepoints inhuman development.

The transition to virtual care could permanently changeSUD treatment delivery. This shift is coinciding with COVID-19-induced social isolation and anxiety, whichcould increase substance use and mental health disorder severity. A common refrain in the treatment andrecovery field is that addiction is a disease of isolation; the cure is connection. To provide virtual treatment andthe connection so essential to recovery, many SUD treatment centers are launching virtual services without amethod for assessing how, where, and why virtual services are affecting their patients' quality of life and SUDrecovery. The ACHESS smartphone app is currently being used at 40 Iowa treatment sites in the parent study,“Test of a patient-centered e-health intervention in addiction treatment settings.” ACHESS offers a guide and amethod for assessing use of virtual services and an unprecedented research opportunity. From 3/3/20 to3/20/20, sign-ups for ACHESS in the parent study increased by 67% compared to the two prior weeks. Activityon the ACHESS app has nearly doubled in the same period! This supplement will address patient andorganizational factors because of their integral roles in providing virtual care and adopting patient-centeredtechnologies. The supplement will enhance ACHESS with new COVID-19 related features designed to helppatients comply with social distancing guidelines, cope with unprecedented social isolation, and access virtualservices and supports. The research will study how patients use ACHESS features, how organizations referpatients to the ACHESS, how they interact with patients in ACHESS, and the overall impact of the ACHESSfeatures. The supplement's research aims are: Aim 1a: Refine ACHESS to provide information, support, anddata on COVID-19, social distancing, adjusting to social isolation, and how to use virtual SUD services. Then,study how patients use existing ACHESS features before (for existing ACHESS services only), during, andafter the announcement of social distancing guidelines. Aim 1b: Assess how the enhanced ACHESS APPaffects anxiety, loneliness, and reported COVID-19 infections. Aim 2: Create ten case studies describing howagencies implemented and used COVID-19 enhanced ACHESS and how their patients used COVID-19enhanced ACHESS. This supplement's projected outcomes will help us understand how to design virtualrecovery systems to mitigate the effects of a pandemic and the resulting social isolation. The results will helpdesign a virtual recovery system that can be used in future emergencies and to address the on-goingchallenges of social isolation in society post-COVID-19.

To understand the full impact of this pandemic on the livesof survivors and the magnitude of this emerging public health crisis, we must study the brain. We helped definethe plague of disabling features suffered by millions of intensive care unit (ICU) survivors called Post-IntensiveCare Syndrome (PICS), characterized by an acquired Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression. Approximately 10% to 15% of COVID-19 patients develophypoxemia requiring hospitalization, which can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome and the need forlife support, including mechanical ventilation. Up to 26% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 require ICUadmission. We hypothesize that COVID-19 survivors who are hospitalized will have a high burden of PICS-related acquired-ADRD, PTSD, and depression. To test this hypothesis, we propose this NIH AdministrativeSupplement to the BRAIN-ICU-2 Study (R01AG058639). This Administrative Supplement will allow us to usethe BRAIN-ICU-2 long-term follow-up infrastructure to collect 6-month cognition, PTSD, and depression datafor a NHLBI-sponsored randomized trial (ORCHID) that is evaluating hydroxychloroquine versus placebo on15-day death, mechanical ventilation, or oxygen supplementation. We will ascertain these 6-month outcomesusing a comprehensive phone battery that incorporates robust neuropsychological tests for memory, attention,language, reasoning, and executive function, and diagnostic evaluations for PTSD and depression. OurAdministrative Supplement is titled “Outcomes Related to COVID-19 treated with Hydroxychloroquine amongIn-patients with symptomatic Disease - Brain Outcomes and Psychological Distress (ORCHID-BUD)” and willconduct 6-month follow-up assessments in 270 adults who are hospitalized with COVID-19 infection andsurvive. ORCHID-BUD has the following specific aims: (1) To determine the epidemiology (i.e., prevalence) ofcognitive impairment (i.e., acquired-dementia) at 6 months and if hydroxychloroquine administration isassociated with improvement in these same outcomes; (2) To determine the epidemiology of PTSD anddepression at 6-months, and if hydroxychloroquine administration is associated with improvement in thesesame outcomes, and (3) To identify modifiable risk factors (e.g., sedatives, isolation, intravenous fluids,pressor, ACE-inhibitor or ARB use, etc.) associated with worse long-term cognitive impairment, PTSD, anddepression at 6 months. To our knowledge, this investigation will be the first ever to conduct robustneuropsychological assessments for SARS, MERS or COVID-19 survivors, and the first among COVID-19 toconduct diagnostic PTSD and depression assessments. This Administrative Supplement will leverage BRAIN-ICU-2 and ORCHID's resources to conduct a high impact and novel investigation at relatively low cost and helpprovide a comprehensive evaluation of COVID-19's effect on long-term cognitive and psychological outcomes.

The pandemic has interfered with many other importantendeavors, including NIH-sponsored non-COVID HIV clinical trials. We need robust plans to implementmeasures to expand SARS CoV-2, allowing research units to resume studies being conducted on HIV, whilemaintaining the safety and well-being of participants and staff. To this end, we have developed strategies relyingon a combination of testing for active disease, evaluating seroprevalence, and conducting operations in waysthat enforce social distancing and utilization of personal protective equipment (PPE). This project is beingimplemented at the Vanderbilt Therapeutics Clinical Research Site (VT-CRS), and the Washington UniversityPrevention & Therapeutics (WPT) CRS. This strategy will comprise two aims that involve research participants,their household contacts, and staff: Aim 1) To utilize resources obtained through this administrative supplementto expand SARS-CoV-2 testing within the regions of our Clinical Research Sites; and Aim 2) To utilize resourcesobtained through this administrative supplement to more quickly and fully resume on-site research activities atour Clinical Research Sites. Among the activities to be implemented are universal testing of study participantsfor infection by CoV-2 PCR prior to study visits, either by staff during parking lot drive-through visits or self-collected remotely by study participants. At one CRS, testing will also be offered to adult household contacts ofstudy participants. There will be active screening for symptoms of COVID-19. There will be CoV-2 antibodytesting at the beginning and end of the project period, of staff and/or study participants. This project willsubstantially expanding CoV-2 testing, and expedite the opening of our NIAID-funded CRSs. In addition, theexperience and information gained during this project will inform future strategies to further expand testing andfacilitate clinical trials operations.

The impact of the pandemic response may delay help-seeking and intervention delivery, widen inequalities, and amplify existing risk factors. Policy-makers and commissioners urgently need longitudinal data on representative populations to guide the mitigation of longer-term impacts at scale. Consequently, we propose broadening the scope of the funded 2020 follow up to the national Mental Health of Children and Young People in England (MHCYP) survey, to include three waves of data collection (June, October, January) and all participants who consented to re-contact. This approach has significant advantages over current convenience surveys, most importantly the use of a well-characterised national probability sample with pre-pandemic baseline data on mental health and risk factors. The aims are: 1/ To track mental health and wellbeing over the course of the pandemic and up to a year afterwards 2/ To identify groups whose mental health may be most adversely affected, and explore risk and protective factors. 3/ To track the impact of and compliance with social distancing measures and school closures on children and families 4/ To examine changes in access to services and support. We will use a combination of online questionnaires and remote semi-structured interviews augmented by health and education data linkages. Content will include child and parent mental health, and impact of covid-19 on education, social and family life. Our output strategy will prioritise rapid dissemination, followed by high impact publications.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	679786.0 GBP

This will generate strong evidence for major unknowns in infection natural history, and by using transmission models we can translate findings to improve UK projections of subsequent waves. Uniquely this community has maintained community level records on treatment both within and outside the home for all members providing an unparalleled record of the impact of COVID-19 and combined with their highly-connected population structures and large inter-generational household structures make them an ideal case-study in understanding drivers of transmission in high-risk communities and in particular the role and/or risks associated with children. We will undertake a cross-sectional survey enrolling 500 households. We will collect information on household structure, social mixing, evidence of COVID-19 and collect samples for serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 and HCOV infection. We will collect detailed data on community understanding and perceptions of risk and acceptability and feasibility of future control strategies such as vaccination. We will use these data to fit a mathematical transmission model of SARS-CoV-2 and estimate risk of each transmission in different settings, such as households, schools, synagogues and yeshiva, which is critical as the community (and the country) exit lockdown. By analysing households, we will quantify transmission from children, by comparing the force of infection by household size and composition. This information is critical for re-opening of schools in the Autumn.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	251240.0 GBP

The first case of infection in the UK was reported on 31st January 2020 and with cases continuing to rise, the country was put into lockdown on 23rd March in an effort to reduce the spread of disease.Throughout the epidemic in the UK, mathematical models (including predictions from Warwick) have been used to provide support to the government and to guide decision making. However, these models are typically required to repeatedly produce new outputs as more data emerges on a daily basis on cases and deaths, and there is a need to investigate how the predictions are likely to change as more data become available.This project will develop methodology that will allow for robust parameter inference of the Warwick model, which is already being used for UK-decision support. We will enhance our real time model fitting, incorporating up to date information on cases and outcomes, and use this framework to determine multi-phase adaptive control policies, with a focus upon optimal timing of relaxation and tightening of social distancing measures, that should be implemented to mitigate future infection waves. Our results will be communicated directly to the scientific pandemic influenza modelling group that advises the UK government.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	220403.0 GBP

Usually, hands-on detailed movement assessment results in a targeted rehabilitation plan, with ongoing evaluation required as needs change. During Covid-19, many people, of all ages, have received no rehabilitation, and rehabilitation need is escalating with recovering Covid-19 patients; creating a "tsunami of rehabilitation need". In response, clinicians are rapidly adapting and creating telerehabilitation solutions to manage caseloads and prioritise those at risk of deterioration, with little specific guidance, training or support. Professional bodies and clinical networks highlight the marked variations in approaches used, expressing concerns about potential inequity and inefficiency. Our rapid literature review underlines this problem, citing lack of specific guidance/training as barriers to effective telerehabilitation implementation. This has immediate and long-term relevance given the "new-norm". Research aim: Develop a Toolkit & Training package for the current/future workforce, wherein telerehabilitation will be integral to rehabilitation assessment and management. Study Design: Knowledge to Action Framework, methodology commonly used in implementation science. Key steps include: (i) literature review to inform guidance/provide examples of best practice; (ii) national online survey to identify clinicians' needs, (iii) production and evaluation of the Toolkit through iterative cycles of data collection, evaluation and refinement (initially in the SouthWest); (iv) national roll-out/evaluation, (v) production of final training package for use within clinical/educational arenas. Study outputs: Practical guidance, process pathways and training to optimise the confidence and competence of clinicians to effectively implement telerehabilitation in people recovering from Covid-19 and those with physical disability from across the lifespan.

Policymakers have emphasised the need for a whole population approach to studying mental health during pandemics but no such study has yet been conducted. With initial funding from the Universities of Sheffield and Ulster, early in the crisis we began collecting longitudinal data from a sample of 2,025 UK adults that is representative of the population in age, sex, household income, etc., measuring anxiety, depression, health behaviours, political beliefs and other relevant variables using standardised measures. We have reported our detailed methods, (https://psyarxiv.com/wxe2n) mental health findings (https://psyarxiv.com/hb6nq) and health psychology findings (https://psyarxiv.com/typqv) from wave 1. Wave 2 follow-ups began on 21th April. Having established the earliest, most comprehensive study of mental health and social adjustment in any pandemic we now seek funding for 6 more waves of survey data from the same respondents (with resampling to replace panel attrition) beginning Wave 3 between May 18th and March 2021. The survey is supplemented by detailed studies of subgroups using qualitative interviewing, cognitive methods and momentary assessment. This and successive waves will allow us to report timely data on changes in mental health and psychosocial functioning from beginning to end of a pandemic for the first time, identifying vulnerable groups needing help. Our findings are being used by the Cabinet Office, Public Health England and Scotland and the Department of Health and Social Care.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	391434.0 GBP

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project. The WHO database of research on COVID-19 contains 589 studies, the majority of which are on virology, epidemiology and clinical management. Only two (Kavanagh 2020; McCloskey et al. 2020); discuss (but do not report research on) wider governance issues. Yet the Chinese Communist Party leadership’s response to the epidemic has been comprehensive well beyond clinical management. It has set up high level coordinating mechanisms across government ministries that have issued hundreds of policy documents setting out containment measures.

The WHO database of research on COVID-19 contains 589 studies, the majority of which are on virology, epidemiology and clinical management. Only two (Kavanagh 2020; McCloskey et al. 2020); discuss (but do not report research on) wider governance issues. Yet the Chinese Communist Party leadership’s response to the epidemic has been comprehensive well beyond clinical management. It has set up high level coordinating mechanisms across government ministries that have issued hundreds of policy documents setting out containment measures. In this way it has mobilized Party and government organizations across (for example) social care, transport, and policing that reach through local governments into every work place and community.

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project. The further spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 outside China, causing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) globally has led to an outbreak that WHO announced 12 March 2020 as a pandemic. The role of Healthcare Workers (HCWs) in managing the outbreak is critical, while working in a setting where they may be inadvertently exposed to SARS-CoV-2, and WHO has prioritised research on how best to protect them from infection and disease. The similar “Public Health Emergencies of International Concern” caused by Zika and Ebola highlighted another important aspect: the need to integrate social sciences research into the outbreak response and to address ethical questions around studies and data sharing, in this context involving HCWs. With our proposal, we aim to integrate three key priorities in a unique way. We will leverage existing funding and our experience within the ICONIC study, funded by the Wellcome Trust/DoH (2014-18). We propose an in-depth analysis of risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs including longitudinal sampling, tracking of movement and studies of behaviours and influences on them (capability, opportunity and motivation). We will perform a virological analysis of infected patients with serial samples to construct a detailed analysis of transmission clusters. The latter will provide valuable clinical data on virus shedding. Finally, we propose to address the ethical questions around the use of apps and wearables, data sharing and conducting studies during an outbreak to produce a set of definitive recommendations for policy makers.

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project. In preparing for a possible COVID-19 pandemic, estimates of severity, in particular of both the numbers of infections occurring at different levels of severity and the infection- and case-severity risks, are crucial to understand and predict the burden and impact of the epidemic on healthcare services. Such estimates are most importantly needed by age and risk group (e.g. defined by co-morbidities) strata, although in the early stages of an epidemic, strata-specific information is rarely available. No single dataset can provide enough information on its own to estimate severity, but estimation is feasible by synthesising multiple datasets, such as: line-listing data from first few hundred type studies; surveillance data including case counts, numbers accessing healthcare, and numbers of deaths; cohort studies; and household studies. Such a synthesis needs to account for biases inherent in each data source, including differential ascertainment by severity level; and to account for the incomplete nature of the data, which, collected in real time, are typically affected by censoring of final outcomes (recovery/hospital discharge or death). We propose to make the best use of both individual- and aggregate-level data that will become available, by using a combination of survival analysis techniques (e.g. curerate mixture or competing risks models) and Bayesian evidence synthesis in a single analysis to estimate severity in real time, as data accumulate over the course of the epidemic, and once the epidemic is over.

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project. This proposal focuses on the molecular underpinning of enhanced transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, and develop strategies to attenuate it to arrest viral spread. Viral infections spread based on their ability to overcome multiple barriers and move from cell to cell, tissue to tissue, person to person and even across species. Host expansion, transmissibility and tissue tropism of coronaviruses are primarily determined by host adaptations of the viral Spike. Alignment with related coronaviruses has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 Spike carries additional protease-cleavage sites. However, whether the SARS-CoV-2 Spike undergoes additional processing, the identity of cellular proteases involved and whether they confer enhanced transmissibility to SARS-CoV-2 is currently not known. To arrest the chain of transmission, we will determine: (i) the identity of the cellular proteases, (ii) whether inhibiting the proteases blocks virus transmission, (iii) whether blocking cleavage of the viral Spike itself blocks transmission. Using activity-based protein profiling we have captured serine-proteases that are specifically activated in SARS-CoV-2 infected samples but not in SARS- or MERS-CoV. We have already identified two such proteases and will scale-up to identify the others. We aim to inhibit these proteases both genetically and pharmacologically, to test functional consequences on virus transmission and tissue tropism. Additionally, we aim to mutate the proteolytic processing sites on the viral Spike itself, to assess effects on tissue tropism and transmission. Our unique combination of tools and expertise, puts us in an excellent position to study and inhibit transmission of SARS-CoV-2.	Medical Research Council	P&Cs	213137.0 GBP

Of all the key worker groups, delivery workers is the one has most gig workers who are precariously employed. Huge spikes in demand have been reported by supermarkets, online grocers and food delivery services. The employers have responded by hiring more workers or requiring existing employees to work longer shifts. Certain epidemiological characteristics of the COVID-19, namely subclinical transmission, incubation period and varying viability on surfaces, present significant challenges to protect delivery workers. We aim to understand, based on different scenarios of risk mitigation measures and social distancing strategies, 1) how delivery workers contribute to the UK’s national response by delivering to households and hence reduce number of outgoing trips; and 2) how delivery workers could potentially contribute to transmission. We will collect data from key stakeholders of the sector to understand how the supply chains and delivery workers responded to the COVID19 outbreak and to build scenarios for mathematical modelling. Using these models we will assess the impact (positive and negative) of current delivery activities, as well as additional scenarios reflecting stricter lockdown conditions, taking into account effect of risk mitigation measures, by considering the number and nature of contacts they made in the communities (including vulnerable groups). Household transmission models will be used with external forcing into households and infection back to gig workers directly considered.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	337913.0 GBP

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project. This project is intended to provide the evidence base for environmental infection control to help control transmission in the healthcare and other environments. The following questions will be addressed Does SARS-CoV-2 survive in the aerosol state in a range of environmental conditions and for how long? Can SARS-CoV-2 survive on a range of environmental surfaces found in healthcare facilities and domestic premises and for how long? Are commonly used room decontamination systems effective at inactivating SARS-CoV-2? Are commonly used air sampling techniques capable of effectively sampling SARS-CoV-2 for subsequent analysis by PCR and plaque assay? All these questions will be addressed using fully developed published methodologies currently available at PHE Porton Down allowing the questions to be answered rapidly. The results of the studies will inform infection control practices and other linked studies carried out within healthcare facilities within the UK and internationally.

The new coronavirus disease that emerged in 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a pathogen termed SARS-CoV-2. To develop a rapid and effective therapy against infection, we are proposing to develop an ovine immunoglobulin treatment against the spike protein of this virus. Binding of antibodies to this protein will neutralise cell entry and prevent it's infectivity. Use of ovine immunoglobulin therapy is widespread for other applications, and a therapy rapidly developed for Ebola virus disease (termed EBOTAb) which demonstrated protection in guinea pigs and non-human primates. The use of polyclonal sera recognising muitiple epitopes eliminates risks of escape mutations occuring and eliminating the effectiveness of antibody therapy. This approach is also rapid, cost-effective and has a proven path to regulatory approval. To develop this therapy, recombinant spike protein will be produced in a mammalian expression system to ensure relevant protein folding and confirmation. A large batch will be produced for immunisation of sheep. Immunisations will be conducted using a facility in Australia, to mitigate risks associated with BSE. Sera will be sent to PHE for assessment of antibody levels and once sufficient antibody levels are achieved, plasmapheresis sampling will be undertaken. Immunoglobulin from these samples will be purified to develop the therapeutic material. This will be characterised at PHE for binding and functional properties before being testing using a susceptible animal model for protection against infection and disease progression.

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project. This COVID-19 paediatric sero-epidemiology study will adapt an existing national research network and ethically-approved NIHR-funded study to collect sufficient childhood and teenage serum samples for near real-time monitoring of increases in paediatric COVID-19 sero-positivity rates across the UK in 2020. The importance of sero-epidemiological monitoring is emphasised in the Public Health England (PHE) pandemic influenza protocol, currently being adapted in response to the COVID-19 threat. This requires the monthly collection of 1000 serum samples, including 100 per month in each of the 0-4, 5-9, 10-14 and 15-19 year old age-groups. This is essential to understanding the rates of symptomatic and asymptomatic infection in children, a population that are the predominant transmitters of most respiratory viruses. This information is in turn crucial to understanding the severity of COVID-19 disease in children, as well as modelling the spread of this virus through the community and planning an effective public health response. The challenge of obtaining blood samples from representative cohorts of children (rather than residual sera from sampling for clinical purposes) had already led to the Oxford Vaccine Group (OVG), PHE and seven regional partners throughout England establishing the ‘What’s the STORY (Serum Testing of Representative Youngsters)’ network to evaluate antibody levels against vaccine-preventable diseases. This study has commenced, and with additional funding would be expanded to collect 3200 samples throughout 2020, including collection of individual level information on recent respiratory illnesses and relevant medical history. Further extension would be possible if needed with appropriate resourcing. This study will form a rapid, responsive and crucial component of the UK response to this emerging global threat.

Human epithelial cells will be seeded in “ready to transfect” multiwell plates, designed and produced in the laboratory of HE. Those plates are containing dried siRNA/transfection reagent complexes. When the cells attach to the surface, reverse transfection enables siRNA mediated knockdown of a single gene, in high-throughput. Then, the cells will be infected with clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates collected by SC and cCytopathic effect and MTT assays performed. After inactivation by paraformaldehyde, these transportable plates will be sent to the lab of HE who will elaborately phenotype the cells using an established imaging pipeline. RK will compare the hits from the screen to time-lapse proteomics data of SARS-CoV-2 infected human epithelial host cells (data was derived from SC recently), omics data from other coronavirus infection studies, and gene associations to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. This will lead to a short list of host dependency factors for which drugs will be selected employing publicly available drug databases. Selected host factors and drugs will be validated in the lab of SC employing a broad selection of SARS-CoV-2 isolates. In addition, RK will infer a SARS-CoV-2 specific protein interaction network and identify clusters of host factors to get drug combinations, which will be experimentally validated by SC.

The usage of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) enables the differentiation into organoids with human tissue-like features. iPSC can also be used to differentiate human lung organoids (HLO). The organization of HLOs is similar to the native lung, e.g. these organoids contain upper airway-like epithelium with basal cells, immature ciliated cells, smooth muscle, myofibroblasts as well as alveolar-like cell types. Thus, HLOs offer an excellent model to study human lung diseases like COVID-19. Moreover, the iPS derived organoids overcome several of the limitations of currently used biopsy lung derived models (availability of alveolar epithelial type II cells (AT2), inter biopsy variance). Within this proposal we aim to elaborate basics for the establishment of a high-throughput approach (differentiate HLOs with low variance). HLOs will be characterized using cryo-sectioning and immunofluorescence analysis upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. We aim to study viral replication kinetics and host responses. We recently contributed to the establishment of the first reverse genetics system for SARS-CoV-2 offering the flexibility of using reporter viruses for a screening approach. Finally, we will test our system upon treatment with established antiviral compounds and aim to set up screening approaches to test antiviral compound libraries. Our approach offers a state-of-the-art model to study SARS-CoV-2 derived pathology and paves the way for the identification of effective antiviral drugs at high throughput level.

T-cell immunity mediated by CD4 and CD8 T cells represents a cornerstone in the control of viral infections. The knowledge of virus-specific T-cell epitopes represented by HLA-presented peptides provides on the one hand a diagnostic tool and on the other hand various therapeutic options including vaccination approaches and the transfer of virus-specific T cells or T-cell receptors, which was already proven to be effective against various viral infections. Thus, we aim within the proposed project to characterize SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell epitopes from all known proteins of the virus covering the most common HLA allotypes. Using ELISpot assays we will perform a high-throughput screening of 120 potential SARS-CoV-2 HLA class I and class II T-cell epitopes predicted by the established algorithms SYFPEITHI and NetMHCpan using PBMCs from volunteer donors that recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection (SARS-VD). Validated T-cell epitopes will be further used to characterize SARS-CoV-2 immunity. This approach will finally allow to i) gain more detailed knowledge about the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the immune system, ii) provide novel diagnostic tools to identify and monitor people with SARS-CoV-2 immunity, and most important iii) define possible target structures for the development of virus-specific immunotherapies for the treatment of the COVID-19 disease.

Since it is expected that COVID-19 will be comparatively harmless or even asymptomatic in children, it can be assumed that a high number of infections in this group will be not detected, causing children to act as spreaders of the infection. The aim of this study is to obtain a prospective monthly estimate of the seroprevalence of an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 in children and adolescents in Germany in the period from 01.05.2020 to 30.04.2021 in 12 sentinel children's hospitals and thereby describe the yearly course of the epidemic in children and adolescents: • What is the maximum prevalence reached at the peak of the epidemic? • When does the monthly increment flatten? • Are there differences with the temporal course by age, sex, and region? • What is the estimated burden of suffering related to the SARS-Cov-2 in children? • Does the burden of suffering vary by age, sex, ethnicity or underlying disease? • Which proportion of confirmed positive cases has been previously diagnosed by a physician or other medical experts? Data on the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in children are mandatory for understanding the previous epidemiology and for guidance of the management of the epidemic in the future.

Probably most of the infected children remain undetected due to the lack of clinical symptoms. The rate of seroconversion can be assessed by measuring SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG antibodies 2-4 weeks after the infection.The aim is to estimate the rate of seroconversion to SARS- CoV-2 in a large and unselected sample of asymptomatic children at defined time points (screening examinations in outpatient practices) in an urban region of North-Rhine-Westphalia. Symptoms and history of COVID-19 symptoms will be assessed and IgA and IgG antibodies measured. Possible risk factors for SARS- CoV-2 infection from the patient’s history (e.g. co-morbidity, smoking exposure, social aspects etc.) will be detected. Frequency of infections and pulmonary symptoms in seropositive/negative children symptoms during the one year follow- up are recorded. Additionally, the rate of seroconversion in mother-child pairs (concordant vs discordant) will be evaluated in order to estimate the risk of exposure. Variations in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 will be measured since angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) l seem to play a crucial role for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells.

To instruct T cells viral components must be presented by MHC molecules alongside costimulatory molecules on antigen-presenting cells. MHC molecules show a high degree of variation across the population and the distribution of these variants (allotypes) vary significantly between individuals and ethnicities. Thus, T cell responses are significantly tailored by the combination of an MHC allotype and the presented viral peptide. Recombinantly expressed MHC allotypes will be loaded with in silico predicted and verified viral peptides. Using these sets together with newly discovered costimulatory molecules for T cells will enable us to expand and visualize specific T-cell responses of small subpopulations. The novel approach will be used to characterize the T-cell responses of recovered SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals to determine their effector and memory response which mediated protection/cure. Results will be compared to T-cell responses of COVID-19 patients in the first phase of the disease for prediction of disease outcome. In perspective, the novel approach can also be utilized to expand and manipulate SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses as cellular therapy for COVID-19 patients. Our results will provide novel insights into the mechanisms of cellular adaptive immune responses against the still largely unknown SARS-CoV-2 virus, which could form a basis for diagnosis and future therapy of this infection."; Research Type: discovery; Study population: T-cell analysis for healthy individuals, patients infected with COVID-19 and recovered individuals after COVID-19 infection	Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung	Research Grant	274528.0 EUR

This study will explore the major risk perceptions and behavioral intentions of different target groups. Communication methods and formats will be designed that promise to foster adequate behavior thus leading to risk reduction. The chain from risk perception, awareness, willingness to act up to behavioral change will inform the analysis. The risk perception paradox describing the gap between risk perception and protective action, can be addressed by identifying the opportunities of and barriers to risk adaptive behavior and enabling target-specific and inclusive risk communication. A long-term COVID-19- risk communication program will be established that is still effective when the peak of the crisis has been passed but protective action is still needed.The project will use survey methods in conjunction with focus groups and consensus methods (e.g. Group Delphi). This study will aim at providing a long-term risk communication manual, based on empirical and risk communication experience and a consensus among communication experts.

In addition to the acute consequences for the quality of care, long-term consequences for patients and care providers are to be expected because of the COVID-19 crisis. To learn more about the current situation, as well as the expected and actual long-term consequences, general practitioners and specialists will be surveyed throughout Germany as part of the study. For this purpose, a random selection of general practitioners (n = 5,000), internists (n = 3,000), ENT specialists (n = 2,000), pediatricians (n = 3,000), gynecologists (n = 2,000), and dentists (n = 4,000) will be surveyed anonymously using an online questionnaire. At the same time, the questionnaire offers the possibility to give extensive free text answers, which are analyzed qualitatively to form the basis of the next surveys. The online surveys will be conducted as trend analyses (3 cross-sectional analyses) after 2, 5, and 13 months. Differences according to urban–rural areas (degree of spatial aggregation), age and gender, medical specialization, and organizational form of the practice (community health center (MVZ), shared practice, or group practice) will be analyzed, and statistical group comparisons will be carried out.

390	Troy Sadler	University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill	None	2020-03-01	2021-02-28	RAPID: Responding to an Emerging Epidemic through Science Education	Education and Human Resources - At this moment, there is global concern about the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its potential to become an epidemic in the U.S. and other countries. Reports of past studies on student understanding of epidemics and how they are taught in school indicate that teachers are reticent to teach the material because the science is unclear given the emerging nature of evidence, or because they don?t understand it well themselves. Curricular resources are limited. Consequently, many students are left on their own to grapple with a potential public health emergency that could affect them and their families. The problem is further complicated by misinformation that may be spread through social media. There is less public understanding about the science of the virus and how it spreads; the risk of being infected; treatment, or, the severity of the illness. This research project will produce curricular materials designed to help students learn about viral epidemics as both a scientific and social issue. It will engage students in scientific modeling of the epidemic and in critical analyses of media and public health information about the virus. This approach helps students connect their classroom learning experiences with their lives beyond school, a key characteristic of science literacy. This project is an example of how science education can be both engaging and relevant. <br/><br/>Researchers at the University of North Carolina and the University of Missouri have been studying how to teach about issues at the crossroads of science and social concerns such as community health; they have developed a framework to build curriculum materials focused on student learning of such complex issues through modeling and inquiry. For this study on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); first, the researchers will study student responses to the epidemic in real time, collecting data on student initial understandings and concerns. Then, using this information, they will work with 7 high school science teachers familiar with their framework to build a prototype curriculum unit, and test it in classrooms in 4 high schools selected for their socio-economic and ethnic/racial diversity. The study will gather data on student interest in the epidemic, as well as how students access information about it through various forms of media, and how they vet news reports and social media. The researchers will also use pre- and post-test data to assess student learning. After this initial enactment of the curriculum materials developed to teach about the epidemic, researchers and teachers will revise the curriculum materials to make them more effective. The final products will be a curriculum unit that will be readily available and modifiable for teaching and learning about future epidemics, as well as greater understanding about how students deal with vast amounts of information about societal issues that affect their immediate lives and the science behind them.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics by preK-12 students and teachers, through the research and development of new innovations and approaches. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for the projects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

391	Ponisseril Somasundaran	Columbia University	None	2020-04-01	2020-09-30	RAPID:Novel Foam formulations for decontamination of surfaces with minimum wastewater generation	Engineering - The broader impact of this RAPID project is to advance the understanding of a new disinfectant composition. A common approach to contain the spread of infectious diseases involves spraying decontaminating disinfectants onto the floors in hospitals, apartments, parks, airports, footpaths, and other surfaces. The disinfectants commonly used are bleach, hydrogen peroxide, phenols and iodophors. Sprays of such solutions on surfaces do not stick to surfaces of protective clothing and hence have to be applied multiple times a day for decontamination results. Furthermore, such operations can result in seepage of the solutions into the ground. Considering the pandemic nature of infectious diseases such as COVID-19, decontamination practices can often span for months, causing prolonged exposure to disinfectant fumes that may be harmful to the lungs and irritating for the respiratory tract. The proposed project aims to overcome these issues by developing and applying disinfectant formulations as a foam allowing sufficient exposure. A foam with super spreaders can penetrate cracks and crevices, sticking to surfaces long enough to decontaminate. The formulation will be designed for decontamination of floors and windows in houses, vehicles, hospitals, and large areas such as airports. In order to further minimize the use of disinfectants such as bleach, an antimicrobial reagent serving as the foaming agent will be used. This will benefit communities experiencing contagious diseases. <br/><br/>The objective of this RAPID project is to prepare a set of innovative foam formulations that differ in disinfectant and surfactant type, and test them for their foamability and deployment using a sprayer. A biosurfactant surfactin that also exhibits anti-microbial properties will be used as a foam stabilizer. This project will: Determine the air/water interfacial tension as a function of surfactant concentration; study parameters, including the rates of foam formation (foamability) and breaking (stability), as well as bubble size; determine and correlate storage and rigidity modulus values for the foams with foam texture for different air/water ratios; study deployment with a variety of delivery equipment, such as household and backpack sprayer and foam lancer; characterize the time-dependent texture of foam formed on a tile surface and relate it to the foamability, the foam-stability parameters, and the storage and elastic modulus values. The tile surfaces after foam completely breaks down will be analyzed using an electron microscope to assess if disinfectant is deposited uniformly or in the form of patches. This assessment will be verified using the Raman spectroscopic mapping of the tile surface; the interfacial tension data at different ratios of surfactant types provide an estimate of their adsorption density at the air/water interface in the presence of hypochlorite ions in the aqueous phase, while the foam stability parameters provide insights into their intermolecular interactions at the interface and the possibility of synergistic effects among different types of surfactants that govern the stability of a foam.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

To safeguard society from viruses, each country/state/locality needs to dynamically adjust health policies, plan near-term health care capacity, and control population movement with little time latency. Accurate real-time prediction of virus spread is essential for making the health system respond in a fast and proactive manner to disease variations and disruption events (e.g., staffing and supply shortage). This project pursues fundamental research to develop simulation models of human movement and virus spread dynamics, prediction of real-time positions of infected population in the spato-geographic network, and development of decision support tools for the design of healthcare policies under disruptive events and processes. The proposed research is at the interface of engineering and public health to gain a better understanding of disease spread dynamics from both perspectives. Effective simulation analysis and prediction of virus positions in geographic regions will not only help optimize the design of healthcare policies to control the propagation of infectious diseases, but also help safeguard the US population and make health systems more resilient to disruptive events.<br/><br/>This RAPID project will leverage data analytics and simulation models to gain a better understanding of virus spreading dynamics. The objective of this research project is to develop continuous flow simulation modeling and analysis of human movement/traffic and virus spread dynamics in spatial networks. Specifically, we will investigate the derivation of health policies and infectious disease control so that the healthcare system can respond expeditiously and effectively to disruptive events. The proposed project will study three sets of policy-relevant characteristics that are central to the understanding of the impact of public interventions on virus spread, namely regional infrastructure of health care delivery, regulatory measures to slow down the virus spread, and effectiveness of information transparency. As the dynamics of infectious diseases often change over time, simulation models and analytical algorithms from this project help support decision-making in real time. The proposed methodology is generally applicable to a wide range of infectious diseases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

393	Jiaxing Huang	Northwestern University	None	2020-04-01	2021-03-31	RAPID: On-mask Chemical Modulation of Respiratory Droplets	Mathematical and Physical Sciences - NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT: <br/><br/>Spread of infectious respiratory diseases, such as influenza, SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, usually starts from virion-laden respiratory droplets, which are released by an infected person during coughing or sneezing. Most of the droplets end up depositing on various surfaces such as doorknobs, tabletops, buttons, handrails, and touchscreens, turning them into potentially infectious objects. For infection to occur, these virions must remain active when they are picked up by another person, often through direct contact by hands, and then transferred to mouth, nose and eyes. Direct transport of virus-laden droplets and nuclei to the respiratory tract is also possible through inhaling within close proximity to the source. Therefore, to slow down or even prevent virus spread, it would be desirable to greatly reduce the number and activity of the virions in those just-released respiratory droplets. This RAPID award, which is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research, explores chemical modulation strategies for deactivating virions in the respiratory fluid droplets passing through a medical mask. This can reduce the number of active virions at the very source of their spread pathways, the cough. The project also helps to seed an effort to rally researchers in physical sciences and engineering to study the problems, develop new hypotheses, create user-centered solutions and educate the general public, to address the many challenges associated with the transmission and spread of infectious respiratory diseases.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT: <br/><br/>Facial masks are often required for patients to block and absorb large respiratory fluid droplets, and to reroute those smaller escaping droplets to reduce their forward travelling distance. It would be desirable to develop drop-in strategies to add anti-viral functions to the disposable masks used by patients. This RAPID project, which is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research, develops such an on-mask, chemical modulation strategy that focuses on altering the chemical composition of the escaped respiratory droplets to deactivate virions. The starting model system is a chemical modifier based on a conducting polymer. The polymer is doped with chemical agents that are known to generate harsh micro-environment to deactivate virions. The dopants can readily dissolve in warm respiratory fluid droplets during exhalation, but they do not vaporize in the incoming stream of colder and drier air during inhalation. Such an on-mask chemical modulation strategy adds chemical sanitization function to common medical masks for reducing the viability of virions. Since this drop-in chemical modulation is applied at the very beginning of the chain events of virus transmission, it is effective for all potential transmission pathways. Additionally, through this award stronger connections between biological/medical research and physical sciences/engineering are established and serve to inspire new hypotheses, questions and ideas that drive innovations to address the challenges associated with the transmission and spread of infectious respiratory diseases. A significant effort of this RAPID project is used to achieve this goal, so that the physical sciences and engineering communities can be better informed, educated and prepared to work with biological and medical researchers to create solutions, and join them in the educational outreach activities for the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is currently spreading across the world rapidly, including in the United States, with major adverse impact on health and the economy. The SARSCoV-2 outbreak has led to several urgent efforts to develop vaccines that may offer protection against this virus. It is unknown as to whether the current approaches being pursued will elicit protective immune responses in humans. While vaccines have been very effective against many pathogens, the empirical methods for vaccine development pioneered by Pasteur and Jenner over two centuries ago have failed to produce effective vaccines against Human Immune Deficiency Virus, Malaria, Tuberculosis, and many other pathogens. Therefore, rational design of vaccines based on a mechanistic understanding of the pertinent virology and immunology is being pursued, and these efforts include work that is rooted in statistical physics. SARSCoV-2 is phylogenetically most similar to SARS-CoV. This project will use a machine learning approach to understand how the SARS-CoV-2 virus interacts with the immune T cells. This work will directly impact the design of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and vaccines against future endemic-causing pathogens.<br/><br/>Analyses of patients who have recovered from SARS-CoV shows that antibody responses are not prevalent a few years later, but memory T cell responses are durable and may offer long-term protection. The main questions addressed by this project are 1. Will the SARS-CoV peptides targeted by human T cells that are mutated in SARS-CoV-2 still elicit human T cell responses - i.e. are they immunogenic? 2: Are the 102 peptides identified by host major histocompatibility molecules binding assays alone that are common between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic in humans? If not, they are irrelevant from vaccine design perspective. The goal of the work proposed here is to take a physics-based machine learning approach to determine the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 proteins to human T cell responses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Predicting the speed and severity of infectious diseases like COVID-19 and allocating medical resources appropriately is central to dealing with epidemics. Epidemics like COVID-19 not only affect world-wide health, but also have profound economic and social impact. Containing the epidemic, providing informed predictions and preventing future epidemics is essential for the global population to resume their day-to-day work and travel without fear. Shortage of resources puts undue stress on healthcare system further risking health of the community. Preparedness and better management of available resources would require specific predictions at the level of cities and counties around the world rather than solely at the level of countries. The project will provide a predictive understanding of the spread of the virus by developing machine learning based computational models to study the transmission of the virus and evaluate the impact of various interventions on disease spread. The project will learn infection prediction models for COVID-19 considering the following. (i) Predicting at state/county/city-level rather than country-level as finer granularity is essential in planning and managing resources. (ii) How infectious a person is changes over time. Learning the model through observed data will help in understanding of the temporal nature of the virality. (iii) At such granularity travel is a significant reason for the spread and needs to be accounted for. (iv) Available data needs to be ?corrected? by finding the number of underlying unreported cases that are not observed and yet influence the epidemic dynamics. The project will also solve the resource allocation problem based on the prediction ? for instance if a certain number of masks will be available next week in a certain state, how should they be distributed across different hospitals in the state (which hospitals and how many in each state)?<br/><br/>Proposed project ReCOVER will use a novel fine-grained, heterogeneous infection rate model to perform predictions at various granularities (hospital/airports, city, state, country) while accounting for human mobility. ReCOVER will integrate data from various sources to build highly accurate models for prediction of the epidemic across the world at various granularity. Due to the ability to capture temporal heterogeneity in infection rate, the approach has the potential to provide insights into infectious nature of COVID-19 which are not fully understood yet. The project will address the issue of unreported cases through temporal analysis of historical infections and correct the data. The right granularities of modeling will be automatically identified, e.g., when to model a state over its cities to trade-off precision for higher reliability in predictions. The proposed project also formulates and solves a resource allocation problem that can guide the response to contain the epidemic and prevent future outbreaks. This is provided by optimal solutions to resource allocation over a network where each node (representing a region) has a function that captures probabilistic response. While the project obtains data with COVID-19 in consideration, the model and algorithms developed under the project are applicable to a wide class of contagious diseases. The project will culminate into an interactive customizable tool that can be used to perform predictions and resource management by a qualified user such as a government entity tasked with managing the epidemic response. The data and code will also be shared with research community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

This time-critical research project investigates how peoples? feelings of uncertainty about the spread of COVID-19 across the United States impacts emotional and motivational behaviors to avoid the virus, even when people may be unaware of how they feel and act. Emotion-based responses are hypothesized to be amplified because of the uncertainty involved in a contagion spread. To test this hypothesis, the project develops a novel smart phone application that participants can use around the country, even when they are in physical isolation. The smart phone application creates a novel way to study the emotional impact of virus transmission as well as educate participants about their own motivations to stay healthy. This project informs and educates about the science of COVID-19 transmission and prevention to help develop interventions for this and future pandemics.<br/> <br/>This time-critical RAPID project utilizes the smart phone application to engage in immediate nationwide testing of one thousand individuals from across the country. Testing will continue for nine months so that peak and declining rates of disease are captured. The smart phone application assesses non-conscious motivational tendencies to avoid objects and people which could potentially transmit COVID-19. The research also tests how these motivational tendencies promote or hinder health-related behaviors such as handwashing and social distancing. Importantly, the project investigates regional differences of infection rates across the United States to test the influence of increasing and declining infection rates on peoples? feelings and actions. The research and the software developed in this project will facilitate the development of future interventions aimed at reducing the emotional distress caused by the spread of deadly diseases and to increase healthy behaviors in response to them.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Social Psychology Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

397	Paul Miller	Louisiana State University	None	2020-04-15	2021-03-31	RAPID: Coronavirus-Driven Aerosol Reductions in East Asia and the Effect on Atmospheric Dynamics	Geosciences - The goal of this project is to determine how China?s government-mandated COVID-19 quarantine during February 2020 altered the meteorological conditions in which the disease was being transmitted. During the height of the COVID-19 outbreak in East Asia, the Chinese government authorized closure of many industrial facilities, temporarily and dramatically reducing air pollution in East China. The swift reduction of particulate emissions, which can weaken the intensity of incoming solar energy, would have likely allowed more sunlight to pass through the atmosphere, thereby increasing surface air temperature during the quarantine. Because pathogen transmission can be retarded in warmer and more humid conditions, increased surface air temperatures concurrent with quarantine-reduced aerosols may represent another, yet unintentional, mechanism by which large-scale lockdowns can slow the spread of COVID-19. This project will employ satellite imagery and weather model simulations to determine the extent to which reduced air pollution altered air temperature, as well as several other meteorological conditions, during February 2020 in East China. The findings of this project will also reveal additional important information about how atmospheric particulates influence regional weather patterns on a normal, non-quarantine basis.<br/><br/>This project will mine daily satellite images of NO2, aerosol optical depth (AOD), and air temperature as well as in-situ data from the World Meteorological Organization and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) to assess the co-evolution of pollution decreases and air temperature increases. Additionally, the project will employ the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) in a numerical modeling experiment for February 2020 over East China, whereby one simulation is initialized with normal emissions and the second simulation reduces emissions commensurate with the satellite observations collected during February 2020. This project will yield three key products: (1) Daily database of NO2, AOD, and surface, 925-, and 850-hPa temperature over East China, both absolute values and departure from climatology; (2) Two one-month weather simulations for typical emissions and COVID-19-reduced emissions over China; (3) The net impact of aerosol radiative effects on air temperature, as well as a summary of any changes to circulation, cloud cover, and precipitation. These products are valuable for the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as future disease outbreaks, because they can inform how quarantines and lockdowns potentially impede pathogen transmission via aerosol reductions and associated meteorological feedbacks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

This project surveys the public opinions, attitudes, and behaviors of thousands of Americans in order to map and track the social disruptions caused by the outbreak, economic shutdowns, and responding public policies. The project will enhance understanding of (1) effectiveness of public policy in changing individual behavior to conform with public health recommendations; (2) the ways in which different forms of public communication create understanding about the pandemic and distribute public health recommendations; and (3) social and psychological stress caused by social distance and quarantine. The rise of SARS, MERS, H1N1, and COVID-19 underline the need to understand these phenomena ? not just the epidemiology of pandemics, but the effective social policies and practices that create positive behaviors and mitigate harms. This will not be the last event of its kind, but with a thorough understanding of its effects, we can be better prepared for the next one. As such, the findings will inform governmental policies at several levels. It will also inform civic leaders and residents, thus helping all to mount efforts to mitigate pandemics? effects.<br/><br/>The COVID-19 pandemic has quickly disrupted American life. Surveys of opinions and attitudes and behaviors can track both these social disruptions and responses to them. The project utilizes an internet panel of 500 respondents, recruited daily throughout the period of contagion increase, for a total of 7,000 respondents. The sample is nationally representative, with an oversample of individuals over age 55. Once the peak number of cases has passed, daily sample size will be reduced to 250 respondents per day, for another sample totaling 7,500. To ensure representation, the project will utilize quota sampling with post-stratification weighting. Survey responses will be matched with local health department data, including number of tests, confirmed cases, and fatalities, as well as other policy data, including school closures, gubernatorial announcements and orders, and state-level legislative actions. By including geographic measures, the project will ensure future researchers will be able to explore how community actions affected respondents? attitudes, well-being, and public health behaviors. Findings from the project will inform sociological theories regarding scientific knowledge, inequality, political institutions, community, stress and social trust.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Nevertheless, the dramatic outbreak differences with respect to diverse geographies, regional policies, and cultural groups also raise confusion, contradictions, and inconsistencies in disease outbreak modeling. It is therefore crucial to build a knowledge base of COVID-19 to understand the correlations and roles that different factors play in predicting the spread of the virus, thus enabling both individuals and health care officials to implement appropriate policies to mitigate the effects of the epidemic on public health and society at large. This project will create a COVID-19 coronavirus testbed and knowledge base, as well as a personalized risk evaluation tool for individuals to assess their infection risk in a dynamic environment. <br/><br/>The technical aims of the project include two thrusts. The first creates a testbed and knowledgebase that includes information for modeling outbreak and mutation of COVID-19. This testbed will serve as a benchmark for the public to model and understand the spread of COVID-19, and eventually mitigate the negative effects of COVID-19 on public health, society, and the economy. The second thrust develops a multi-source deep neural network-based predictive tool to combine demographics, policies, regional infections, and individual information for personalized risk evaluation. As a result, the public can employ personalized information to estimate their infection risk level, using social and behavioral information (e.g., family size, shopping patterns, and dining patterns), local authority policies (e.g., school, restaurant, and movie theater closures as well as night time curfew), demographics (e.g., population age, density, and income), health condition (e.g., heart disease incidence, cancer prevalence, and substance abuse), and regional virus condition (e.g., number of infection cases in the region studied and infection rate).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Cleaning workers wear different levels of personal protection ranging from simple surgical masks to professional high efficiency filtration masks. Depending on the mask type, cleaning process, surfaces, and disinfectants used, cleaning workers can be exposed to disinfection byproducts that form as a result of reactions between disinfectants, the surfaces being cleaned, and the mask materials. This project will quantify inhalation of disinfection byproducts during disinfection while wearing different classes of masks and use this information to make recommendations on which mask to wear and how often to change or clean the mask or mask components. These data are directly relevant to the current worldwide COVID-19 crisis and similar future pandemic challenges. The core project team includes at least three graduate research assistants, one postdoctoral scholar, and five professors with different backgrounds and at different stages of their careers. Thus, a further impact of this project will be advancing education and training the next generation of scientists and engineers in techniques to respond to pandemic challenges. <br/><br/>This project consists of a two-phase approach to address potential health threats to cleaning workers resulting from the large-scale use of disinfection in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of the first phase is to define possible concentration ranges of chemicals that flow through personal protection masks based on: 1) the type of disinfectant used; 2) the application process (e.g. wiping, spraying, or fogging); 3) chemical processes forming byproducts (such as reaction of cleaning products on surfaces); 4) environmental conditions (such as ventilation/dilution rate); and 5) proximity of the cleaning worker to the chemical source. The goal of phase two is to characterize the inhalation of disinfection byproducts. A full-scale thermal manikin equipped with a nose and mouth breathing simulation system will be exposed to uniform concentrations of byproducts determined in phase one in an environmental chamber. Surface chemical reaction processes and kinetics will be studied with different masks and byproduct inhalation will be assessed via mass spectrometry. The manikin will be equipped with four different classes of masks: surgical mask, dust mask without exhalation relief valve, dust mask with exhalation relief valve, and professional mask. It is likely that some masks decrease inhalation exposure to disinfection byproducts while others increase exposure via adsorption of cleaning product vapors to the mask and by addition of moisture due to exhalation. These processes lead to a mask chemistry that produces additional chemical products whose concentration is much greater in the mask than in the ambient air. These secondary products are potentially more harmful than the primary vapors of cleaning products. Successful completion of this study will provide timely and critical data relevant to the current crisis by identifying risks for different types of masks and cleaning products. Such information will inform recommendations on mask use to protect the health of cleaning workers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Over the longer term, the results will contribute to improvements in our preparedness for future pandemics. It will increase our understanding of the role that social media plays in public understanding of and response to a pandemic, and also will advance work on message framing within health informatics and health communication. Some of the results could help society and government prepare for potential contingencies such as bioterrorism and other unexpected large-scale emergencies. During a global health crisis, public health interventions such as quarantine and isolation can limit the spread of the virus, reducing morbidity and mortality while reducing the impact on the health care system. Health education interventions, particularly via social media, are critical for ensuring that the general public heeds recommendations from experts. Given the generally low e-health literacy of older adults, and in light of the increased impact that pandemics have on older adults, as is particularly the case for COVID-19, ensuring that older adults and their caregivers understand and trust public health information is critical for saving lives.<br/> <br/>This mixed-method study will allow quick and safe collection of data from people currently experiencing a pandemic, to understand the factors that influence trust in current public health information interventions in a real setting. Its online data collection will not risk the health of researchers or participants, seeking a stratified sample including a significant number of older adults and employing a robust recruitment strategy. The work will be done in three rigorous but swift stages: (1) a survey, including a battery of previously validated instruments along with open-ended questions specific to the current COVID-19 pandemic; (2) an experiment to compare the effectiveness of different health messages; and (3) a set of recommendations that can guide public health officials in deciding how to tailor messages for particular audiences based on factors such as age and e-health literacy. Human subjects perform differently in real versus hypothetical scenarios, so the best time to evaluate how people react to public health interventions during a pandemic is when a very significant one is in process. COVID-19 represents a rare opportunity to collect data from people while they are experiencing the phenomenon under investigation. This project will identify factors that influence trust in public health information, and how public health information interventions can be tailored to be effective for people of various ages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

The project focuses on students in a project-based first-year engineering design course. Although it is effective in slowing viral infections, the sudden change to online instruction will also have a significant impact on undergraduate student experiences and learning. Successful online courses typically are developed over months or years, with substantial support from instructional designers or other specialists at the institution. In this case, the development of online courses had to be accomplished within weeks, and institutions did not have the capacity to scale assistance to all faculty as they converted their in-person courses to online courses. Courses that include hands-on experiences, such as design courses, are a particularly thorny challenge to effectively deliver online. <br/><br/><br/>High-quality instruction is critical in first-year courses, where students begin to form their identities as engineers and develop confidence in their engineering abilities. Understanding the effects that the rapid shift to online courses has on student experiences in project-based engineering courses could fundamentally change the way administrators, educators, and industry prepare for and adapt to the unique needs of first-year students. The findings of this work will provide insights that can guide informed decisions about the future of engineering education. Three research questions will guide the investigations: 1. How do the self-efficacy beliefs and identity of students evolve during this transitional period? 2. How do the self-efficacy beliefs and the experiences of instructors evolve during this transitional period? 3. Are the results of the first two questions conditioned upon individual differences or the use of mediating technologies? To answer these questions, the project will use a mixed methods approach that features qualitative interviews, surveys, data mining from learning management systems, and natural language processing. The research plan will be broken into two phases: 1) in-situ data collection and analysis; and 2) analysis of the collected data. The analysis will enable the research team to explore the implications of this sudden shift on future course offerings, instructor behaviors and beliefs, and student persistence, particularly the retention of first-year engineering students from underrepresented groups. It can also provide insights about how to improve online versions of laboratory, design, and other courses that require students to do hands-on work.

403	Ashok Srinivasan	University of West Florida	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	Collaborative:RAPID:Leveraging New Data Sources to Analyze the Risk of COVID-19 in Crowded Locations	Computer and Information Science and Engineering - The goal of this project is to create a software infrastructure that will help scientists investigate the risk of the spread of COVID-19 and analyze future epidemics in crowded locations using real-time public webcam videos and location based services (LBS) data. It is motivated by the observation that COVID-19 clusters often arise at sites involving high densities of people. Current strategies suggest coarse scale interventions to prevent this, such as cancellation of activities, which incur substantial economic and social costs. More detailed fine scaled analysis of the movement and interaction patterns of people at crowded locations can suggest interventions, such as changes to crowd management procedures and the design of built environments, that yield social distance without being as disruptive to human activities and the economy. The field of pedestrian dynamics provides mathematical models that can generate such detailed insight. However, these models need data on human behavior, which varies significantly with context and culture. This project will leverage novel data streams, such as public webcams and location based services, to inform the pedestrian dynamics model. Relevant data, models, and software will be made available to benefit other researchers working in this domain, subject to privacy restrictions. The project team will also perform outreach to decision makers so that the scientific insights yield actionable policies contributing to public health. The net result will be critical scientific insight that can generate a transformative impact on the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including a possible second wave, so that it protects public health while minimizing adverse effects from the interventions.<br/><br/>We will accomplish the above work through the following methods and innovations. LBS data can identify crowded locations at a scale of tens of meters and help screen for potential risk by analyzing the long range movement of individuals there. Worldwide video streams can yield finer-grained details of social closeness and other behavioral patterns desirable for accurate modeling. On the other hand, the videos may not be available for potentially high risk locations, nor can they directly answer ?what-if? questions. Videos from contexts similar to the one being modeled will be used to calibrate pedestrian dynamics model parameters, such as walking speeds. Then the trajectories of individual pedestrians will be simulated in the target locations to estimate social closeness. An infection transmission model will be applied to these trajectories to yield estimates of infection spread. This will result in a novel methodology to include diverse real time data into pedestrian dynamics models so that they can quickly and accurately capture human movement patterns in new and evolving situations. The cyberinfrastructure will automatically discover real-time video streams on the Internet and analyze them to determine the pedestrian density, movements, and social distances. The pedestrian dynamics model will be reformulated from the current force-based definition to one that uses pedestrian density and individual speed, both of which can be measured effectively through video analysis. The revised model will be used to produce scientific insight to inform policies, such as steps to mitigate localized outbreaks of COVID-19 and for the systematic reopening, potential re-closing, and permanent changes to economic and social activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

404	Lia Stanciu	Purdue University	None	2020-04-15	2021-03-31	RAPID: A Surface-Based Detection Platform for SARS-CoV-2	Engineering - Millions are at risk of severe health issues and even death caused by coronavirus infection (COVID-19 disease). The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic and an international public health emergency. In response to this situation, Prof. Stanciu at Purdue University aims to design strategies that will result in a point-of-need testing platform for rapid, sensitive, and effective detection of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in saliva. This project provides opportunity to students to conduct research that integrates electrochemistry, biology, and device design to increase fundamental knowledge for advancing biosensing technologies.<br/><br/>The sensor design is based on the measurement of impedance changes upon specific hybridization of surface-immobilized nucleic acid probes with target viral RNA. An important aim of this research is to understand the electrokinetics and fundamental science that strongly influence probe hybridization efficiency. This information is critical for achieving rapid (minutes), highly selective, and highly sensitive detection of the viral RNA (without amplification) under physiological conditions. This biosensing platform can be integrated into field-deployable devices or remote monitoring systems connected to cellular networks that will transmit information to disease control centers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

405	Emily Kroshus	Seattle Children's Hospital	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	RAPID: How parenting practices influence child safety thoughts and behaviors in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - Parenting practices can help limit the impact of COVID-19 in two key ways. First, parents can support children?s implementation of behaviors to reduce virus spread (e.g., hand washing, social distancing, and self-quarantine). Second, parents can help limit child anxiety (e.g., overseeing and discussing media exposure and providing factual and age appropriate information). By understanding the factors that drive differences in these parenting behaviors, this research can help determine how best to support child and family wellness at a population-level during this challenging time. Differences in parenting are likely related to differences in parent perceptions of the threat of the virus to their family and the extent to which they believe they can take steps to limit this threat. This study will also assess how family socioeconomic characteristics such as income, education, occupation, and health literacy relate to threat and coping perceptions, parenting behaviors, and child outcomes. <br/><br/>A nationally representative survey of English and Spanish speaking parents of children aged 6-17 years will address this need with the following aims: (1) describe parenting practices related to COVID-19, (2) determine the extent to which these parenting behaviors are related to differences in parent threat and coping perceptions, and (3) explore and describe the relationship of family socioeconomic characteristics to threat and coping perceptions, child anxiety, and child health behaviors to reduce virus transmission. Results of this study will provide key information about how to target and optimize health communication in the current pandemic context and can identify where structural interventions to address fundamental disparities in social determinants of health may be needed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

406	Elise Miller-Hooks	George Mason University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: A Portal to Support Models for Assessing Strategies for Hospitals in the COVID-19 and other Pandemics - MASH-Pandemics	Engineering - This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) grant will develop the Models for Assessing Strategies for Hospitals (MASH) in Pandemics (MASH-Pandemics) Portal with requisite modeling capabilities urgently needed by hospitals and regions in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. Important perishable, time-sensitive data and information to support this effort will be collected. MASH-Pandemics will build on previously developed sophisticated, detailed discrete-event simulation-based hospital capacity and capability analysis models of typical U.S. urban hospitals. This RAPID project will support the re-specification of these models, data collection, model runs, and results analysis, outcomes from which will aid hospital administrators and regions in making optimal operational changes and collaboration plans enabled through state and national emergency declarations in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. An online portal will be constructed on which details of the modeling capabilities, practical findings and recommendations, along with potential policy implications, for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic will be posted. Additionally, run requests from hospitals, hospital collaborations and geographical regions will be taken through the portal. This work will generate crucial synthetic data needed to develop quick recommendations and analyses in a period where time is of the essence. Key outputs will include, for example: potential for various modified operational strategies to benefit hospital performance and patient survival, hospital collaboration strategies to aid regional response, anticipating critical supply needs to mobilize and prioritize support from supply chains (or Federal response capabilities), and recommendations for effective implementation of capacity enhancement strategies (alternative standards of care, modified operations, demand management). The project will provide input to educational activities in the future, once the project is complete and the pandemic subsides. The focus of this work during the period of performance will be on providing, as quickly as possible, crucially needed recommendations to hospitals and regions based on results from runs of high-quality models. <br/><br/>This RAPID award will advance mathematical modeling techniques for capturing critical hospital services during crises. It employs concepts of open queuing networks, discrete event simulation, stochastic modeling, transient system analysis, and statistical methods. The work will collect critical, perishable data, and will generate crucial synthetic data for rapid analysis and prediction urgently needed in this period of a global COVID-19 pandemic. With its quantitative approach, the project will enhance hospital readiness, capacity and capability, by identifying means for efficiently using severely limited, critical personnel and physical resources, the allocation of which will affect the survival of potentially thousands of lives and the safety of health care workers along with support staff. Findings from this effort will directly support hospitals at the front line, or regions in COVID-19 ?hot spots,? by providing the opportunity to request runs and receive analyses of the effectiveness of COVID-19 response strategies and collaboration mechanisms. It is anticipated that the run requests will come in a variety of forms, requiring data collection, modeling work, investigation to capture stochastic processes with input distributions and parameters, and results analyses. The models can be quickly enhanced and mobilized, and initial findings and recommendations made public in only weeks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

407	Kyle Jamieson	Princeton University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Fine-Grained, Privacy-Responding Contact Traceback for COVID-19 Epidemiology	Computer and Information Science and Engineering - This project, CoV-2-Traceback, enables approaches that mitigate the negative effects of COVID-19 by facilitating the process of contact tracing during an epidemic. The approach eschews explicit location tracking, instead using granular signal monitoring techniques at mobile phones to infer the physical proximity of pairs of phones. The work will also respect user privacy, by giving users control over the data the system collects, in three ways: first, the data the system collects will be stored on the mobile phone itself, second, users will be empowered to clear that data from their phones, or opt-out of the system entirely, and third, each step of the traceback will occur with individual user consent. This automated and highly specific traceback will advance the national health and secure the national defense, both speeding up the process of contact traceback and extending the utility of contact traceback into the latter stages of a pandemic when the goal is to delay and lower daily infection rates. From a societal standpoint, the work aims to engage cellular chipset manufacturers, cellular network providers, and state and national health authorities in the national COVID-19 mitigation effort.<br/><br/>CoV-2-Traceback enables approaches that mitigate the negative effects of COVID-19 by automating the identification and traceback of recent significant risk contacts of a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case. Instead of relying on GPS, which does not work well indoors and in many urban settings, signal processing algorithms examine the cellular control channel to determine whether and for how long other people are proximal to a confirmed positive case. Current medical knowledge indicates that the riskiest exposures involve both time and proximity of contact, but there is a challenge in identifying such exposures with a high specificity that existing technology does not yet meet. The project develops a traceback protocol that resolves a newly-diagnosed user's phone identifiers and then submits phone identifies meeting the foregoing proximity criteria to cellular providers, so they can identify close contacts of the newly-diagnosed case. As COVID-19 surveillance efforts ramp up in each state, the project will leverage state- and county-level background infection rates to validate CoV-2-Traceback's accuracy. Comparing with traditional methods for contact tracing, it will also quantify whether the approach is indeed more specific, flagging fewer patients who in the end turn out to be COVID-19 negative.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

408	Jing Li	Case Western Reserve University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID:Genomic Variation Analysis of Coronavirus to Better Understand the Spread of COVID-19	Computer and Information Science and Engineering - Currently, there is a world-wide pandemic of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) that is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of April 2, 2020, there have been more than one million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 55,000 deaths. These numbers are increasing rapidly. Yet, the short time since the beginning of this outbreak limits our understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 spreads. The objective of this project is to address this gap. In response to evidence that the rate of infections among healthcare providers is alarmingly high, this project will expose transmission patterns in the hospital setting. In collaboration with the Cleveland Clinic, the investigators will have access to genomic, epidemiological, and clinical patient data. Joint computational analysis of this data will result in a computational model that will provide insights into transmission patterns in hospitals, such as from patients to doctors and health workers, or from doctors to doctors. <br/><br/>The activities in this project will be organized along three Aims. Aim 1: Perform whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 samples collected at the Cleveland Clinic. The data will be augmented by existing SARS-CoV-2 sequence data from multiple online databases, as well as existing sequence data from other species. Aim 2: Build an analysis pipeline and perform evolutionary analysis of genomic data obtained in Aim 1. Aim 3: Perform joint analysis of genomic, epidemiological, and clinical data to infer transmission patterns. One of the unique advantages of the project is the ability to directly link identified genomic strains to clinical data. The activities have direct clinical implications for better protecting healthcare workers and minimizing the overall rate of infections in the hospital setting. Findings from this project will be shared with the research community at large to aid further analysis in other hospitals as more data becomes available during this pandemic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Researchers reconstruct the evolutionary and transmission history of the virus by applying algorithms to sequencing samples of COVID-19 patients. However, a key challenge is the presence of multiple strains of the virus within hosts, which is overlooked by current algorithms. This RAPID project will improve the nation?s COVID-19 response by developing algorithms to characterize the ongoing evolution and spread of the viral strains that coexist within patients. The developed algorithms will be applicable to future disease outbreaks.<br/><br/>This RAPID project seeks to understand the impact of within-host viral diversity on the current spread of COVID-19. The project will identify the viral strains coexisting in patients through the development of algorithms that deconvolve COVID-19 sequencing samples. Subsequently, the project will assess whether or not such coexisting strains are the result of multiple infection events. Finally, the project will quantify the severity of the identified viral strains through a protein functional analysis of their mutations. Results will be disseminated through an online portal that enable labs and hospitals to upload their sequencing reads and generate annotations and characterizations of COVID-19 viral strains.<br/><br/>In summary, the goal of this research is to understand SARS-CoV-2 by investigating the evolutionary origins of the virus and its genetic variation within host species in order to determine how molecular variation correlates with host range, and to evaluate risk of further disease emergence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

It pushes people to connect via social media. While social media platforms enable online connection, they can sensationalize some narratives and ignore others, fomenting anxiety and fear. This project will use artificial intelligence to analyze social media data and model psychological wellbeing, distress, and vulnerability. It will provide tools to help understand community social anxiety in relationship to nearby COVID-19 outbreaks. The outcomes of this work have the potential to support public health organizations in (1) responding to the psychological needs and demands of communities affected by the COVID-19 crisis in a timely and proactive fashion; and (2) brainstorming strategies to counter experiences of COVID-19 related anxiety and improve people?s quality of life through resource allocation and prioritization.<br/><br/>This project will assess COVID-19 pandemic impacts and improve the nation?s resilience by: (1) developing data- and theoretically-driven scientific computational methods to identify social media based linguistic and social network markers associated with COVID-19 crisis-related anxiety, stress, and other downturns in psychological wellbeing in affected communities within the United States; (2) developing predictive models to forecast which communities will be most vulnerable to these psychological downturns; (3) leveraging epidemiological models of disease spread to derive holistic views of communities? online activity and their offline spatiotemporal geographical context in relationship to their proximity to the virus; (4) conducting a human-centered evaluation; and (5) providing data, an open-source toolkit, and data-driven presentations of how particular communities are vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic to support public health workers and the general public in creating timely and proactive interventions.

411	Jing Du	UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	RAPID/Collaborative Research: High-Frequency Data Collection for Human Mobility Prediction during COVID-19	Engineering - COVID-19 has and is continuing to dramatically alter the lives of millions of Americans as businesses, schools, and many public places have closed around the country. Recommendations of public officials along with individual concerns and fears have fundamentally changed the pattern of daily routines as Americans have adopted the practices of social distancing, sheltering in place, and even self-quarantine. This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project will improve our ability to assess and predict changes in mobility patterns under sudden disruptions caused by large-scale public health crises such as COVID-19. The specific focus will be to understand changes in mobility patterns and the complex and dynamic decision-making process shaping these changes during the unfolding events associated with this major public health crisis. The project will advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by greatly improving the preparedness and responses of public agencies facing COVID-19 and future similar public health crises. It will also help understand and predict reduction, change, and recovery of human mobility patterns promoting the progress of science in human mobility and urban resilience, in alignment with the mission of NSF.<br/><br/>The objectives of this RAPID project are to: (1) capture and ultimately predict spatiotemporal changes in the patterns of human mobility in response to the COVID-19 pandemic using social media data mining techniques; (2) perform high-frequency individual-level surveys via a smartphone app to understand motivational, decisional, and sentimental factors shaping changes in mobility patterns; and (3) explore conversion and convergence functions for high fidelity and high accuracy human mobility prediction. The intellectual merits of this research include: the discovery of unique mobility patterns emerging from this public health crises related to social distancing, sheltering, and self-quarantine practices; the unprecedented gathering of longitudinal evidence about the motivational, decisional and sentimental factors shaping mobility decisions; and the development of innovative algorithms of using a small representative sample for high-fidelity mobility prediction. The data and knowledge gained from the project will enhance future studies on urban mobility, travel demand and resource allocation modeling, and help policymakers assess the response and recovery of major urban metropolitan area facing a devastating disaster such as COVID-19. Project outcomes will be disseminated through the Boston Area Research Initiative (BARI), an inter-university partnership between Northeastern University and Harvard University, and through the MetroLab Network.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

412	Indrakshi Ray	Colorado State University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: ENSURING INTEGRITY OF COVID-19 DATA AND NEWS ACROSS REGIONS	Computer and Information Science and Engineering - Large amounts of epidemiological data are being generated and collected from a variety of sources to understand the impact and propagation of COVID-19. Similarly, huge amounts of news articles are generated and disseminated about the pandemic to keep the population informed. The appropriateness of the actions taken by individuals, corporations, and governments are often based on the quality of data and news. Thus, ensuring the quality of data and news is important. However, malicious actors can alter the attributes of data records, insert spurious records, or suppress records causing any analysis to be inadequate and misinformation to be propagated. This project addresses the critical problem of defining and identifying spurious data and news concerning COVID-19, and tracking the source of misinformation. The project novelty lies in the development of an approach and associated toolset that adapts and combines Machine Learning technologies to detect spurious data and misinformation and presents the results in a manner that is easy for end users to understand and interpret. The approach detects discrepancies in COVID-19 data and traces the flagged discrepancies back to the data sources. The results obtained from the news sources and those obtained from the medical data analysis are compared to determine correlations between the quality of news and the degree and type of data manipulation performed at any region. The project?s impacts are on significantly enhancing the ability to perform accurate scientific analysis, and detecting and explaining news manipulation with respect to COVID-19. The scientific principles developed in the project are expected to be useful outside the medical domain. The PI and the students identified for this project are minorities. The project will be carried out in the Computer Science Department at Colorado State University which is a BRAID affiliate.<br/><br/>COVID-19 data discrepancies are related to (1) single records, where some field is modified, (2) sequence of records over time forming a temporal dimension, where spurious records have been inserted or records have been suppressed, and (3) sequences of records across regions forming a spatial dimension, where there is a pattern of manipulation or information disclosure across regions. The approach determines the appropriate combination of autoencoders, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Temporal Convolution Network (TCNs), and Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) that can work with data obtained from medical sources and news containing both spatial and temporal dimensions.

413	Alison Galvani	YALE UNIVERSITY	None	2020-04-01	2021-03-31	RAPID: Curbing the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States	Biological Sciences - This project will produce a practical mathematical modeling framework that will assess pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies in the US, over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the midst of this current unprecedented crisis, public health decisions must be made quickly when there is a large level of uncertainty about the burden of COVID-19 in the community. Research to evaluate intervention strategies can help decision-makers to identify the proper control measures and intensity needed for containment and mitigation of COVID-19. To accomplish these goals, the researchers will develop a mathematical framework that will provide estimates of healthcare demands and effectiveness of various containment and mitigation approaches at state and county levels in the U.S. An open-access, interactive dashboard will provide vital insights that policy makers can use to make and adjust informed decisions during the course of the pandemic depending on available resources as well as under various scenarios and locales.<br/><br/>A stochastic modelling framework will be used. The framework will follow the natural history of the disease, with a compartmentalization of susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) and stratified by 16 age groups. The model will be parametrized useing data representing contact patterns, demographic variables, hospitalizations, deaths, incidence, disease characteristics, and capacity of critical healthcare infrastructure (e.g., hospital beds) in US states and counties. To determine an optimal deployment strategy of diagnostic tests tailored to the stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, the researchers will simulate transmission dynamics of COVID-19 to project relevant outcomes of disease. Strategies will account for the available number of testing kits. As the symptoms of COVID-19 are difficult to distinguish from influenza, historical data trends will be used to adjust the number of cases of influenza-like-illness seeking medical treatment. The researchers will explore strategies ranging from testing of individuals presenting in hospitals with COVID-19 symptoms to age and risk dependent surveillance where individuals from high-risk areas would be tested. To assess the impact of various non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 transmission and the accompanying healthcare surge capacity, the researchers will explore the consequences of different public health measures such as contact tracing, self-quarantine, and self-isolation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Hence, search engines can significantly influence public perceptions of the disease and the actions undertaken by the public. If there are language biases in the results of searches, there may also be biases in perceptions and actions taken. This project will systematically analyze the differences in COVID-19 related search auto-completes that are provided to English and Spanish speakers. The results will generate new knowledge on the emergence of algorithmic bias and help ensure equity in health information dissemination at scale amid large-scale health emergencies. The findings will be shared in easy-to-understand terms on an urgent basis in multiple languages to help ensure equal access to health information in the COVID-19 pandemic. This feedback could help improve the health outcomes for numerous individuals facing the COVID-19 pandemic.<br/><br/>The project is designed to yield approaches for countering language-based bias in COVID-19 related health information dissemination by search engines using log analysis and interviews. The first step in this project is to audit the search auto-complete results in Spanish and English, and test if there are systematic differences in the way results are generated across the two languages. The next step is to this utilize focus groups with multiple users to understand how auto-complete queries affect the way English versus Spanish speakers understand COVID-19 disease and take necessary precautions. The findings from the two phases are to be combined to generate guidelines on designing search experiences that support health equity amid a public health crisis. This research topic is likely to attract a diverse range of student researchers, which could help broaden participation in STEM research career pipelines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Real-time location traces of individuals can be used to significantly speed up and scale up contact tracing. However, such use also heightens concerns on individual privacy and data abuse. Urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic requires a careful balance of privacy protection with public health benefits. This project aims to develop techniques and a mobile application, REACT, for REAal-time Contact Tracing and risk monitoring via privacy-enhanced tracking of users' locations and symptoms. To enhance privacy, users can control and refine the frequency and granularity with which their information will be collected and used. REACT will enable: 1) contact tracing of individuals and locations that a confirmed case has contact with for quarantine and decontamination to control further spread, 2) individual risk monitoring based on the locations they visit and their contact with others so they can be informed and alerted; and 3) community risk monitoring and detection of early signals of community spread to prepare for larger-scale infections. <br/><br/>The project will develop and study: 1) efficient and scalable data structures and algorithms for contact tracing queries given a large number of users and multi-resolution location traces; 2) a learning-based approach for modeling users? risks in real time; 3) a social network sensors approach for monitoring the community risk, and 4) a multi-stage privacy approach where users can upload generalized locations to receive alerts and more precise locations when they are notified as possible contacts with confirmed cases for refinement and confirmation. More rigorous privacy enhancements will be studied including location perturbation based on geo-indistinguishability and its variants and searchable encryption for contact tracing on encrypted locations. In addition, the project includes a set of dissemination and education activities: 1) releasing a mobile app with open-source system components; 2) investigating privacy-preserving mechanisms to share the collected data for research studies; and 3) integrating the research in classes and organizing seminar series and tutorials to promote the interdisciplinary research area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

416	Ilya Safro	Clemson University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Automated discovery of COVID-19 related hypotheses using publicly available scientific literature	Computer and Information Science and Engineering - The vast amounts of biomedical information that accumulate in modern databases (such as MEDLINE of the National Library of Medicine) impose a great difficulty for efficient wide surveying by researchers who try to evaluate new information considering existing biomedical literature even when advanced information search engines are used. Automated hypotheses generation systems are designed to help scientists to overcome these difficulties and accelerate their research. The pandemic situation with COVID-19 is precisely one of the cases when such systems can play an extremely important role in coping with the coronavirus. Using two different AI approaches, we have developed two systems to discover plausible hypotheses in the biomedical domain. In this project, we will will deploy the COVID-19 customized hypothesis generation and knowledge discovery system, massively run it on any relevant to this research queries, and publish the results (including trained AI models, and discovered information) in the open domain for broad scientific community with the goal to accelerate the COVID-19 research. This work focuses heavily on addressing fundamental knowledge discovery questions by modeling and formulating scientific hypotheses using the publicly available information in the biomedical domain. However, in general, these methods are not restricted to any specific information domain, i.e., they can be broadly used to discover knowledge in texts. Although our experimental work will be related to COVID-19, the methods can be applied with some reservations to any literature-based analysis. For example, in the Materials Science Initiative, one of the goals is to establish a systematic understanding of the material properties and discover new materials which can be done by analyzing using the massive corpus of papers. In the legal world, identifying related patents can be done using a similar hypothesis modeling methodology.<br/><br/>In the heart of the proposed approach lies a big multi-modal and multi-relational semantic knowledge network of all biomedical objects extracted from a variety of heterogeneous databases of the National Library of Medicine. These objects include but are not limited to scientific papers, abstracts, keywords, phrases, elements of thesaurus, genes, proteins, mutations, pathways, diseases, and diagnoses. We will leverage two systems, namely MOLIERE and AGATHA, that are based on structural and deep learning, respectively. We will customize them using the rapidly updated dataset of new papers that has not been yet processed by the National Library of Medicine but already exists in the open domain such as in various preprint archives and reports. The MOLIERE system is based on the network analysis techniques applied on the graph constructed using the low-dimensional embedding of the papers with the result interpretation methods that are based on the probabilistic topic modeling. The AGATHA system processes texts at much finer granularity, and creates a semantic knowledge network using more accurate embedding techniques followed by the deep learning training for knowledge discovery. Two systems complement each other. While the AGATHA is of higher quality, the MOLIERE is more interpretable. A combination of both will be leveraged in this research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

417	Susan Gelman	University of Michigan Ann Arbor	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Children's Biological Beliefs Concerning COVID-19 Disease Transmission	Education and Human Resources - In the current COVID-19 crisis, developing effective means of educating children about disease transmission is a matter of vital concern, not only for scientific literacy, but also for public health. Children play an important role in the transmission of contagious illness, given how frequently they engage in risky behaviors such as touching their faces or making physical contact with caregivers. Public health recommendations include teaching best practice to children to reduce disease spread, but prior research shows that children are unlikely to engage in these practices without a firm understanding of the underlying process of disease transmission. This RAPID award to a team of researchers at the University of Michigan will assess what children know, what they don't know, and what they think they know (but is scientifically inaccurate) about the transmission of COVID-19. In conducting a comprehensive assessment with children aged 5-12 years and their parents, the researchers will address such questions as: At what ages do children understand aspects of viral transmission that are non-obvious or invisible, such as asymptomatic carriers, or the potential for objects and surfaces to carry infection? At what ages can children go beyond isolated facts they have learned to figure out what to do in new situations? How is children's biological reasoning influenced by non-biological factors, such whether a potential carrier is a friend or a stranger? How does children's reasoning about a pandemic that has already massively disrupted their daily lives (COVID-19) compare with their reasoning about a more ordinary and innocuous illness (the common cold)? Findings from the project will inform parents, educators, researchers, and public health professionals about children's understanding of the transmission of disease in general, and COVID-19 in particular. It will lay the foundation for the rapid development of evidence-based educational interventions that target gaps and misconceptions in children?s understanding, thereby improving both scientific literacy and adherence to public health guidelines. This RAPID award is made by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program in DRL, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. ECR supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning. <br/><br/>The research team will interview children age 5-12 years and their parents, employing a battery of measures to assess children's understanding of the biological processes of viral transmission, comparing COVID-19 with the common cold. Study 1 will address children's understanding of how and why viruses work and spread, with a battery of child-friendly tasks that assess: incubation periods (lag between infection and disease onset), asymptomatic hosts, that viruses can survive on a surface or object (such as a doorknob), and that viruses can gain access to the body through the eyes, nose, and mouth. Study 2 will focus on who may contract, transmit, or suffer the consequences of viral disease, and the role of both biological and non-biological factors (such as a person's nationality, language, or familiarity) in these judgments. For example, children will receive a series of vignettes, each involving two hypothetical characters of different social identities, where disease transmission is a possibility, and will be asked to assess the likelihood that the character will contract the illness, how sick the character will get, and whether or not the character will transmit the illness to another person. While in-person contact is restricted, children will be interviewed via face-to-face remote video and a Qualtrics survey link sent to the parent/guardian. Interviews will be recorded, transcribed, and coded. Intercorrelations among children's performance across the different tasks will assess whether understanding consists of piecemeal facts as opposed to coherent understandings. Determining children's understanding of disease transmission during this global pandemic provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify gaps and misconceptions in children's understanding of viral transmission, to provide a foundation for developing effective educational programming about biology in the elementary and middle school years. It will also be a source of theoretically significant data of central interest to STEM education regarding the coherence of children's biological theories over developmental time, and how children's informal biological theories may shift in the context of an ongoing health crisis. The project will provide a foundation for improving biological education, as well as for public health and children's understanding of and reactions to illness in others.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

418	Sachit Butail	Northern Illinois University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID/Collaborative Research: Agent-based Modeling Toward Effective Testing and Contact-tracing During the COVID-19 Pandemic	Engineering - This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) grant will support research that will improve our understanding of the spread of COVID-19 and potential mitigation strategies at the city level, promoting scientific progress and contributing to national health and prosperity. As COVID-19 continues to spread, the effectiveness of different testing strategies and predictive models are brought into question. Testing strategies include the use of drive-through facilities that have found success elsewhere but may prove impractical for elderly and low-income sections of the population, and the use of hospitals, which adds further burden to the healthcare system and may carry the risk of higher contagion. Mathematical models that forecast the spread of the disease are of paramount importance to inform local and global policy makers on the course of action that should be undertaken to mitigate the outbreak and give relief to the population. However, such models are often confounded by the absence of symptoms in early stages, complex mobility patterns, and limited testing resources. This award supports fundamental research toward a mathematical model that will overcome these confounding factors, through advancements in dynamics and control. By explicitly modeling social and mobility constraints, this research will help increase the general well-being of communities and reduce disparities across the population. The model will afford the simulation of critical what-if scenarios and will include the evaluation of different testing policies and mitigation actions, thereby constituting a valuable support to policy makers involved in the containment and eradication of the epidemic. Research outcomes will be presented to the public, including health professionals and authorities to inform public policy in the ongoing crisis.<br/><br/>The research will respond to COVID-19 outbreak in real time through a fine-resolution agent-based and data-driven model that aims at providing unprecedented insight in the spread and potential mitigation strategies of this virus at the city level. The approach will afford thorough what-if analysis on the effectiveness of ongoing and potential mitigation strategies. The agent-based model will include COVID-19 specific features, such as the type and timing of testing, asymptomatic occurrence, and hospitalization stages. The framework will be grounded in publicly available census and geo-referred data from New Rochelle, New York. Social behavior associated with rational and irrational factors will be included in the mobility patterns of the agent-based model at multiple spatial and temporal scales to increase the granularity of the predictions. Network-theoretic and data-driven control strategies will inform enhanced testing protocols involving active trials on the basis of available contact databases collected at testing sites.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

419	Krishna Narayanan	Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Accelerated Testing for COVID-19 using Group Testing	Computer and Information Science and Engineering - COVID-19 has resulted in an unprecedented global health crisis that may become even more widespread over the upcoming months. Extensive and immediate testing of symptomatic and asymptomatic people is known to be important for implementing containment policies and to ensure that medical resources can be apportioned to different geographic regions appropriately. Individual testing can provide the necessary information; however, this requires enormous amounts of medical and human resources. This project will facilitate widespread testing for COVID-19 while using fewer tests. The main approach is based on the idea of pooling samples from multiple patients and performing tests on combined samples. If the result of a test is negative, one can conclude that no one in the pool is infected, and if the result is positive, then further fine-grained testing can be performed. Pooling-based testing, also known as group testing, can be very effective in reducing the number of tests required for both identifying infected people in a population and for obtaining coarse-grained population-level information about infection rates. In this project, effective group-testing schemes that minimize the total number of tests required and/or the total time taken to conduct tests will be designed, and their performance will be analyzed. <br/><br/>In this project, group-testing schemes that do not require precise knowledge of the infection rates and multi-stage group-testing schemes will be designed and optimized. The trade-off between the number of tests required and the total time taken to complete testing will also be characterized. The robustness of group-testing schemes to correlation in the infection status among the tested population and to errors in the tests will be studied. Using mathematical tools from group testing and hypothesis testing, strategies for rapid classification of infection rates will also be designed and analyzed. Finally, a smart-phone application which guides laboratory technicians through the group-testing process will be developed. The focus will be on small pool sizes and population sizes. Successful completion of the proposed activities in this project will advance the state of the art in the field of group testing, and provide practical and efficient solutions for COVID-19 testing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

COVID-19	Computer and Information Science and Engineering - This project will advance national health through the development of a robust, predictive model to graphically represent the spread of COVID-19 through an innovative integration of public health information and social media data. This project develops a predictive modeling tool to visually represent the spread of COVID-19 or other potential pandemics utilizing artificial intelligence techniques to support data gathering, analysis and representation of the outcomes. The societal benefit is significant if the researchers are successful in developing a model that utilizes traditional public health data integrated with social media data to expeditiously create a reliable prediction of disease spread. This project will contribute towards building an open source database that can be accessed anywhere across the globe while providing early warning detection and signals to government agencies. <br/><br/>This RAPID project develops a large-scale pandemic model to enable data sharing, using AI-based approaches, and predictive modeling. Specifically, the project proposes a model for rapid and early disease detection, by combining three novel intellectual approaches to outbreak detection. These three approaches include 1) Self-organizing systems theory to detect nascent pattern formation; 2) Leveraging topical proximity in research communications over geospatial proximity of infected individuals; and 3) Loss of complexity in topical networks as an indicator of an ?unhealthy? system with an impending outbreak. This integrated approach has not been previously attempted in efforts to track disease outbreak. The proposed methodology is expected to produce a working model within the 2nd quarter of the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Reactions to the coronavirus have not been reliably preventive or defensive due to a host of psychological, communicative, political, and demographic factors that influence how individuals process and respond to information related to significant, widespread health threats such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The interdisciplinary approach of this research considers individual-level psychological characteristics, communicative processes, relational interactions, and media use behaviors intrinsic to risk response, as well as the interplay of partisanship and relied-upon partisan information sources and place-based constraints on information and care access that characterize rural America and especially Appalachia. Knowledge gleaned from this research will help improve Appalachian residents? health and ability to use communication strategies more effectively in response to future pandemics.<br/><br/>Using a multi-wave quantitative panel study, this research investigates responses to the coronavirus pandemic in rural Appalachia. The research features an 8 week longitudinal study of Appalachian adults recruited and managed by Qualtrics. Each individual completes bi-weekly surveys to measure and examine trajectories of coronavirus/COVID-19 perceptions and reactions to official precautions. This project seeks to understand how individuals? perceptions of risk, efficacy, and precautions, and factors such as stress and anxiety change over time due to time-invariant predictors and time-varying predictors. Time-invariant measures, assessed only during the first wave of data collection, include personality traits, uncertainty intolerance, partisanship, political ideology, travel time to nearest primary care facility, health insurance coverage, and personal demographics (i.e., age, sex, education, income, and race/ethnicity). Time-variant measures, assessed at all four time points, include perceived COVID-19 severity and susceptibility and precaution efficacy; COVID-19 uncertainty discrepancy, emotional reactions, anticipated outcomes, efficacy perceptions, and information management behaviors; evaluation of COVID-19 messages, media use, COVID-19 thought-listing, depression, anxiety, and stress, repetitive thoughts and behaviors related to COVID-19, COVID-19 interpretation bias, employment status, and perceived impediments to care. Results from this research will advance knowledge of human behavior across several social science disciplines, inform applied research regarding anxiety and mental health in Appalachia, and improve health communication interventions designed to increase protective health actions in future health crises.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Almost overnight, families have had to develop and support new practices for learning at home as districts scramble to meet the academic, social and emotional needs of their communities. It is essential to collect data now to develop a deeper understanding of how schools and families are adapting to these changes and will continue to do so in coming weeks/months - the troubles they encounter, and the solutions they generate. Retrospective accounts may mask critical features of what was experienced, minimizing the country?s capacity to conceptualize and build more robust, equitable and transformative learning ecologies for the future. Emphasizing an equity approach to solution development, this research will document how families engage in creative practices to generate powerful learning based on local needs, values, contexts, and histories in this present crisis. It will address the following questions: (1) What resources are schools providing and how are parents navigating and extending these resources to sustain their child?s learning? (2) How are families exploring science and math concepts related to the pandemic? (3) How are parents and families learning to adapt (e.g. communication with teachers; broader social networks) and what challenges do they face (e.g. subscription costs; reliable Internet)? (4) How are digital resources for STEM, curated by the research team, utilized for learning? <br/><br/>Emergency school closures are exposing significant gaps in access to the Internet and communication devices, and the capacity of parents/caregivers and communities to capitalize on technology to sustain health-relevant learning in a time of crisis. This project will use a novel, remote-diary tool based on a smartphone-enabled data collection platform, to reach families across the country. Mobile-phone-enabled remote diary tools make it possible to reach families who are under-connected, not just those with robust technical infrastructure. The data collected will lay the groundwork for creating new socio-technical support systems informed by diverse families? experiences, as the crisis unfolds. Approximately 200 parents with school age children (early and upper elementary grades) living at home will be recruited. This study and a subsequent virtual workshop with other researchers who are also using remote methods to study learning will help establish a broader research agenda to specify the conditions under which socio-technical systems productively augment a family?s capacity to innovate and learn when traditional co-located school settings disappear. It will advance our understanding of how human learning adapts to unexpectedly changed learning environments. This study draws on advances in remote data collection and new analytical tools for innovation in research design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

COVID-19 is rapidly devastating the lives of Americans. The impacts are, and will continue to be uneven, affecting financially and psychologically vulnerable individuals, working parents, and service sector workers across space. The impacts extend beyond the direct physical health effects; the consequences of school and work closures affect labor supply and demand, financial health, mental health, and the global economy. Yet, very little is known about how the pandemic is affecting people?s financial as well as mental health. The researchers will use an existing platform to collect large data sets at regular and short intervals to study the effects of the pandemic on Americans. The results of this research project will contribute to our understanding of how pandemics affect mental and financial health of the vulnerable as well as provide inputs into policies to counter the effects of the pandemic. This does not only help shorten the projected recessions and improve the wellbeing of Americans but also establishes the United States as the global leader in countering the effects of the virus.<br/><br/>This proposed research will attempt to trace the effects of the coronavirus pandemic and the policy responses on labor market outcomes, and enhance our understanding of the links between employment, working conditions, financial well-being, and mental health. The PIs will collect longitudinal survey data over short intervals using the RAND American Life Panel (ALP) platform. The project will use the variation in the impact of the COVID-19 policy response by industry, occupation, and location to: measure the impact of employment/income loss on individuals? financial well-being and mental health, investigate how working conditions mediate the effect of COVID-19 on financial well-being and mental health, study the extent to which worker routines have been disrupted, how these disruptions change over time, and examine how these disruptions affect financial well-being and mental health. The data collection of this project is superior to standard surveys which do not capture sufficient information about employers and employee behavior. A longitudinal survey that contemporaneously captures individuals? changing labor market experiences and perceptions during the pandemic is necessary for understanding the causal links among COVDI-19 and labor market outcomes, financial wellbeing, and mental health. The results of this project will contribute to our understanding of how pandemics affect mental and financial health as well as provide inputs into policies to counter the effects of the pandemic. This does not only help shorten the projected recessions and improve the wellbeing of Americans but also establishes the United States as the global leader in countering the effects of the virus.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

424	Scott Nuismer	University of Idaho	None	2020-04-15	2021-03-31	EAGER: Evaluating the feasibility of a transmissible vaccine within bat populations.	Biological Sciences - Emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19 can arise when a virus normally circulating within a population of wild animals jumps into the Human population. Unfortunately, as we have seen very clearly with COVID-19, once this jump into the Human population occurs, it may be too late to stop the infectious disease from spreading rapidly. A novel solution to this problem is to extinguish high-risk pathogens circulating within animal populations before they can jump into the Human population. One way this can be accomplished is by developing a vaccine for the animal population that is capable of transmitting itself from one animal to the next, vaccinating each animal against the pathogen as it spreads. Recent advances in genetic engineering have made the development of this sort of self-disseminating vaccine possible. What we do not yet know, however, is if such a vaccine would be an effective tool for eliminating coronaviruses (like the virus that causes COVID-19) from the wild bat populations within which they normally circulate. This research will use mathematical and computational models to evaluate the feasibility of this approach and lay the groundwork for developing new types of vaccines that reduce the risk of emerging infectious disease. This research project will also support the training of a first generation female graduate student at the interface of mathematics and infectious diseases.<br/><br/>The proposed work will develop mathematical and computational models evaluating the feasibility of using a transmissible vaccine to reduce the prevalence of SARS-like coronaviruses within wild Rhinolophus bat populations. These models will be parameterized using published data on coronavirus prevalence and seroprevalence within wild bat populations and data on bat population structure, demography, and ranging behavior. Parameterized models will predict the outcome of interventions employing vaccine vectors with different degrees of transmissibility and thus set boundaries on the vectors that could be used to engineer an effective transmissible vaccine. In addition to advancing our ability to reduce the threat of emerging infectious disease, the proposed work will provide training at the interface of mathematics and infectious disease for a graduate student.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

425	Patrick Schaumont	Worcester Polytechnic Institute	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Collaborative: A privacy-preserving contact tracing system for COVID-19 containment and mitigation	Computer and Information Science and Engineering - A crucial tool in the fight with COVID-19 is a contact tracing system that can identify individuals who had close contacts with confirmed cases in the past. Such a mechanism can alarm these individuals so that they can voluntarily self-quarantine. In addition, when these individuals start to have symptoms, a contact tracing system can prioritize them for testing, which will make more efficient use of the limited test capacity and provide early treatment for infected individuals. However, due to strict privacy-protection laws in US and many western countries, it is a challenge to deploy such a system. To solve this urgent problem, this project builds a privacy-preserving contact tracing system, named COVID Detector. COVID Detector relies on smartphones to track both patient and healthy person's past locations and leverages cryptographic computations to ensure that no private data is exposed during the contact tracing computation. This project addresses the broader need to support, in a privacy-friendly manner, user contact tracing in a modern, complex and highly-connected world. This discussion is presently highly relevant in the context of balancing public health and individual user privacy. <br/><br/><br/>While there are a few existing contact tracing apps for COVID-19, anonymity of user/patient identity is the best that they can provide to protect user privacy. COVID Detector is the first that provides strong protection of both user/patient identity and user/patient trajectory data. COVID-Detector uses homomorphic encryption techniques to match the trajectory of confirmed COVID-19 patients with that of healthy users in the ciphertext domain, so that healthy users can determine their infection risk level. The matching process reveals neither healthy users' nor patients' location data to any party. The use of homomorphic encryption technologies in trajectory tracking is novel and has not been applied before.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Implementation of these policies varies across the U.S. and globally due to local circumstances. A common consequence is a huge shift in Internet use, with university dormitories and high schools emptying and home use increasing. The goal of this project is to observe this shift, globally, through changes in Internet address usage, allowing observation of early reactions to COVID and, one hopes, a future shift back.<br/><br/>This project plans to develop two complementary methods of assessing Internet use by measuring address activity and how it changes relative to historical trends. The project will directly measure Internet address use globally based on continuous, ongoing measurements of more than 4 million IPv4 networks. The project will also directly measure Internet address use in network traffic at a regional Internet exchange point where multiple Internet providers interconnect. The first approach provides a global picture, while the second provides a more detailed but regional picture; together they will help evaluate measurement accuracy.<br/><br/>This project allows to capture an improved global picture of how different parts of the world react to COVID-19, as seen through their use of the Internet. In particular, the results from this research will help understand changing behavior of networks compared to historical data, and provide a new method based on address usage to characterize how people are staying home, and to look for the effectiveness and onset of work-from-home and shelter-in-place.<br/><br/>The project website will be at https://ant.isi.edu/minceq. The project will make all new data generated by this project available at no cost to researchers at https://ant.isi.edu/datasets. The project website and data will persist indefinitely; as of 2020 the website already provides five years of archival data that serves as a baseline.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

To develop optimal strategies for containment and treatment of the coronavirus epidemic, it is critical to understand the cell types and biological mechanisms that mediate viral entry and propagation across the Human population. Recent advancements in single-cell technologies now make it possible to measure the expression of genes at a cell-type resolution. This project aims to provide a comprehensive survey of the cell types used by SARS-CoV-2 for viral entry across the nasal airways, lung, and gut tissue and to understand physiological basis of how age, gender, and smoking history may predispose healthy individuals to infection. Identification of cells containing the two proteins known to mediate viral entry [the receptor protein angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2)] will elucidate the gene expression programs and signaling pathways associated with cells used by the novel coronavirus for host entry. Analysis of single-cell chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) data from the lung will identify the cell-type specific transcription factors and regulatory regions associated with these gene expression programs. This improved understanding of the signaling pathways, gene expression programs, and regulatory mechanisms of coronavirus infection of cells may lead to novel, patient- and region-specific therapeutic targets to combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The single-cell data will be made available for download, analysis, and visualization, thus providing a valuable resource to the scientific community.In addition to dissemination of the findings and contributing to potential treatment strategies for the control of coronavirus infection, the project will support the training and professional development of a data scientist and of a computational research associate.<br/><br/>The catastrophic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) highlights an urgent need for improving scientific understanding of the underlying mechanisms of viral entry and propagation. SARS-CoV-2 uses the host ACE2 receptor protein and protease TMPRSS2 to gain cellular entry; however, what organs and cell types express these genes and how they interact with the host immune system remain obscure. Recent advancements in single-cell technologies now allow for the dissection of cell types and cell states at unprecedented resolution, which has led to groundbreaking discoveries in tissue biology. This project will integrate single-cell RNA-sequencing data across multiple individuals to assess how expression patterns of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the lung, the primary organ linked to coronavirus infection, are associated with an individual?s age, gender and smoking history. It will also provide a broader context of the distinct cell types in the lung and gut expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and elucidate the gene expression programs and signaling pathways that are associated with viral entry in healthy individuals. Finally, analysis of single-cell chromatin accessibility data from different lung regions will identify the key transcription factors and regulatory mechanisms driving the expression programs related to viral entry. Taken together, this project will lead to a better understanding of coronavirus infection mechanisms. <br/><br/>This RAPID award is made by the Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics Program and the Symbiosis, Defense, and Self-recognition Program in the BIO Division of Integrative Organismal Systems, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

428	Allison Pugh	University of Virginia Main Campus	None	2020-08-15	2021-07-31	RAPID: Pandemic School Closures and Teacher-Student Relationships	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - This project assesses how new efforts and strategies for action, developed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, challenge or compound pre-existing differences among students. Existing scholarship predicts that during crises, people and organizations develop new strategies for action. As a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than half of America?s schools have closed down and transitioned to online learning. This constitutes a unique natural experiment in how a crisis and uncertainty can affect teacher-student relationships (TSRs) and how these in turn can affect differences. The current crisis may strengthen TSRs as teachers and schools reach out to students in novel ways and normally non-academic matters such as student?s health and access to the internet at home become priorities. This study will help policymakers and school officials understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting school closures on different groups of students, informing efforts to redress the effects of this crisis and plan for future disasters.<br/><br/>This project expands upon six months of ethnographic observations in two Virginia high schools (conducted prior to school closures) with online observations, interviews and weekly student time diaries and photojournals during the spring and summer of 2020, as well as resumed in-person data collection during fall 2020. Broadly, this project advances knowledge by showing 1) how school and teacher strategies to reach students during this crisis are received; 2) how TSRs change during moments of crisis and 3) how these changes inform differences in student experiences and outcomes. Specific research questions include: (1) How do TSRs shape the impact of the crisis on student engagement and outcomes? (2) How does the ongoing impact of TSRs vary by student background? (3) How does school response to the crisis affect teachers? connections with students? and (4) How does the impact of this response vary based on student background? To address these questions, this study?s data collection includes eight months of observations (both virtual and in-person when schools re-open), collection of weekly student time diaries and photojournals (N=80), and in-depth semi-structured interviews with administrators (N=20), students (N=120) and teachers (N=60).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Although the disruption affects the entire academic community, the impacts are not equal. For example, students with low socioeconomic status, first generation students, and women may be affected more strongly by the disruptions than other students. Thus, based on students? demographics, the pandemic may be more likely or less likely to exacerbate existing or create new differential impacts on students. This study seeks to investigate this likely unequal impact among a large sample of students enrolled in calculus courses in spring 2020. A survey will gather student voices by probing how this disaster has affected students in STEM career pathways. The survey needs to be conducted immediately to gather the information from the students as they experience the disruption in their collegiate education. <br/><br/>The goal of this study is to conduct a timely mixed-methods study to collect data from a representative sample of undergraduate STEM students from varied backgrounds. The data will include the student voice about their experiences including: 1) the transition away from campus; 2) the challenges experienced; 3) the degree to which challenges affected attendance, academic performance, withdrawal rates, and college dropout rates; and 4) factors that facilitated success or failure among among all students, including underresourced and underrepresented students. After gathering data via the survey, the project team will facilitate 15 focus groups of about six students, balanced by socioeconomic status, race or ethnicity, and gender. Using a socioecological framework, the project team will analyze factors across multiple levels, ranging from the individual to public policy, and use the survey and focus group data to develop a quantitative survey. This work represents novel STEM-education research in an urgent and unique context. The findings may immediately inform interventions to address the needs of current undergraduate STEM students in the US. Formal reports and recommendations that arise will be published and disseminated in Fall 2020 and Spring 2021. In the longer term, results may inform evidence-based recommendations regarding distance versus on-campus learning for students, including students from underresourced and underrepresented backgrounds.

430	Michael LaMontagne	University of Houston - Clear Lake	None	2020-05-01	2021-01-31	RAPID: A Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience on the Interaction between the Nasal Microbiome and SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus Infection	Education and Human Resources - Asymptomatic carriers of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus can unknowingly spread COVID-19. Undergraduate students, who routinely congregate on campuses for classes and other activities, have an elevated risk of exposure to respiratory infections. However, as a generally younger adult population, they also have a relatively low risk of progressing to COVID-19. As a result, it is possible that students could be carriers of this virus, posing increased risk of spreading it to others. This RAPID project will expand the scope of an existing Classroom-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) in microbiology at the University of Houston ? Clear Lake. Students currently enrolled in the CURE participate in authentic research in a course-based setting to study the nasal microbiome. Support provided by this award will enable students to add information about their SARS-CoV-2 status to the research. The CURE will allow them to learn both how research is conducted and to potentially generate new knowledge about how the SARS-CoV-2 virus works. Students will also develop and use a virtual reality tool to learn how to use MALDI-TOF to sequence DNA fragments, providing them with skills that are valuable in clinical and research laboratories. <br/><br/>The students enrolled in the CURE have already collected their own nasal swab specimens earlier in the Spring 2020 semester. These specimens were cultured to select for bacteria in the Staphylococus genus. Working at home, students will participate in remote data collection from high-throughput MALDI-TOF analysis of PCR amplicons generated from the 16S rRNA gene with bacterial-domain specific primers. These data will identify which bacterial isolates are Stapthlococcus epidermis. In addition, volunteers from this group of students will be invited to return campus to provide nasal swab samples to be tested for the presence of SARS-Cov-2. A drive-through testing facility that requires students to remain in their vehicles at all times will be used for this purpose. At the facility, registered nurses will survey the students about possible CoVID-19 symptoms. Following FDA guidelines, students will then self-swab, place the swab into a tube containing reagents that inactivate viruses, then place the tube into a secondary container. Thus, only the individual student handles their sample. Co-PI Alexander will collect all of the secondary containers, place them into a third container, and deliver it to a commercial lab to be tested for SARS-CoV-2, using research-only test kits that cannot be used clinically. Students will receive their SARS-CoV-2 status via a blinded protocol that ensures that only the individual student will know their status. The deidentified data from the class will be pooled to examine the relationship between the nasal microbiome and the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Exploring the potential of S. epidermis to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection might provide greater understanding of the virulence of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, there is a urgent need for immediate data collection. In parallel with data collection and analysis, the project intends to develop virtual modules for teaching MALDI-TOF, providing students with training opportunities that would be otherwise unavailable due to campus closure.

The rapid development of the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the shortcomings in the existing laboratory-based testing paradigm for viral diagnostics that features a widespread lack of test kits, extended time delays to obtain test results, and a high rate of false negative tests. The shortcomings of the existing laboratory-based infrastructure are contributing to uncertainty surrounding quarantine failure, confusion among health authorities, and also to a general public anxiety. To address this critical and timely need, in this work, development of point-of-care device is proposed for detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 from nasal fluid samples and in 10 minutes.<br/><br/>The fundamental limitations of current assays for viral pathogens stem from their reliance upon polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, which requires complex, labor-intensive, laboratory-based protocols for viral isolation, lysis, and removal of inhibiting materials. Importantly, PCR requires a large number of time-consuming and precise thermal cycles to enzymatically amplify specific RNA sequences. In this work development of an electrical, label-free and surface modification-free point-of-care device for detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 (1-3 copy/mL) from nasal fluid samples and in < 10 min. The proposed work will combine Bst polymerase in an isothermal RT-LAMP (reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification) reaction, with target-specific primers and crumpled graphene field-effect transistors (gFET) to electrically detect the amplification event by sensing the consumption of primers. These reactions offer the possibility of rapidly detecting SARS-CoV-2 using a simple, inexpensive and portable potentiostat and avoiding the necessity of RNA extraction. In order to develop the proposed detection technology, this proposal will first validate twelve sets of RT-LAMP primers specific to SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, No RT-LAMP primers specific to SARS-CoV-2 are available commercially, neither in the literature. Then, the proposal will demonstrate the feasibility of the RT-LAMP-based electrical approach to detect SARS-CoV-2. Likewise, the proposal will demonstrate the approach as a global health technology to contribute to providing low-cost diagnostics around the world using portable and inexpensive heating block and potentiostat for virus detection and quantification.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

432	Andrea Armani	University of Southern California	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	EAGER: COVID-19 Modular Disinfection System based on Ultraviolet Irradiation	Engineering - Highly infectious microbial and viral diseases are a major challenge to global health and economic stability. In addition to the current COVID-19 pandemic, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) noted that the increase of antibiotic-resistant bacteria outside of medical settings was a cause for significant concern. One strategy for combatting viral and bacterial infections is the implementation of disinfection measures. Among the different chemical, thermal, and irradiation methods, disinfection based on exposure to ultraviolet (UV-C) light has gained favor due to its efficacy against a broad range of microbial and viral agents in a variety of environments. However, UV-C systems come in two categories: expensive and weak hand-held systems designed for small area applications or large commercial systems for medical settings. Both systems are currently challenging to procure. This research effort will design, fabricate, and validate a UV-C system in collaboration with USC Keck Hospital in Los Angeles that can be home built from easy-to-procure components. The research findings will be disseminated through online postings of the designs, podcasts, and an established online conference, as well as through peer-reviewed journals. PhD students and undergraduate researchers will be involved in the collaborative research effort.<br/><br/>The UV-C wavelength band covers 100nm-280nm, and it directly overlaps with the peak absorption of DNA and RNA (~260nm). Upon UV-C absorption, the pyrimidines in the RNA or DNA are converted to pyrimidine (6?4) pyrimidone photoproducts and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. If the population of dimers is sufficiently high, transcription errors occur, ultimately resulting in inactivation of the bacteria or virus. UV-C is recognized as a universal disinfection method for bacteria, and its effectiveness in viral disinfection is not correlated with virus size, but with pyrimidine concentration. Thus, given the universality of UV-C as a disinfection method, designing and validating a system that can be constructed from easy-to-procure components has significant societal impact. The present work plans to leverage the recent rise of open-source electronics and commercially available components to design and build a portable UV-C disinfection system. Two different sources of UV-C will be explored as well as several different enclosure designs and control systems. This work includes both theoretical and experimental efforts. The final system will be validated using both bacterial and viral agents to ensure that the system meets the needs of the medical community and broader society. Given the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic as well as the increase of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the community, designs for easy to build disinfection systems will have significant impact globally.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

433	James McGrath	UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER	None	2020-05-15	2020-10-31	RAPID: Nanomembranes for the Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Biofluids	Engineering - This RAPID project is poised to develop a fast and inexpensive test to detect active infections of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the global COVID-19 pandemic. The high costs of available rapid testing strategies limit their use in population-based screening, particularly in the most vulnerable low-resource communities. In contrast, the test developed here will be relatively inexpensive because it requires neither external power nor additional sample preparation and analysis instrumentation. The test will be tuned to detect the entire range of viral loads observed in individuals with active infections. The project team aims to both design the prototype device and establish proof-of-principle within the first three months of the project. To do so, a diverse and multidisciplinary team including six graduate students, a post-doctoral fellow, a medical doctor, two undergraduate students, and two U.S.-based manufacturers will be mobilized. The project will provide a profound humanitarian and educational experience for the trainees as they work quickly but deliberately to demonstrate the feasibility of a COVID-19 test device urgently needed throughout the world. <br/> <br/>The overall goal of the proposal is to create a manufacturable microfluidic device capable of instantaneous diagnosis of active COVID-19 infections from nasal mucus or phlegm. The microfluidic device will employ ultrathin silicon 'nanomembranes' to identify the presence of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in the biofluid sample. Samples without the SARS-CoV-2 virus or with viral particles smaller than SARS-CoV-2 will not register a positive result. Modifications to the investigators' prior flow cell device designs will be made to ensure the two flow paths can be driven by the surface tension of the applied sample alone. The investigators have contracted with two U.S.-based companies for high-throughput manufacturing of the device components. Proof-of-concept demonstration will be conducted with nanoparticle SARS-CoV-2 surrogates and non-SARS-CoV2 spike protein controls. <br/>Studies will be conducted to define the sensitivity and specificity of the device, minimizing false negatives. Device manufacturing will be done using high-throughput strategies that can be readily translated to high-volume commercial manufacturing. A successful platform will be tested with samples from COVID-19 patients at a New York State flu center run by the University of Rochester.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Social distancing guidelines have led many people to avoid all forms of public life, from concerts and restaurants to everyday interaction in parks, neighborhoods, and the homes of family and friends. In response there has been a massive increase in online interaction: the internet has suddenly become the primary way that many Americans socialize, labor, and learn. It is crucial to gain a better understanding of how the emergence of these changes is related to the pandemic. Even if a vaccine is discovered, preventing catastrophic levels of COVID-19 transmission into the next few years will depend on social distancing that can be sustained and integrated with work, education, and community. This means going online. The starting point for addressing this global challenge is thus the fact that what we call ?social distancing? is really physical distancing. Successful physical distancing will rely on new forms of social closeness online. Yet there is not just one ?online.? A rapid and effective response requires clarifying the impact of virtual worlds as part of different forms of online interaction that comprise a virtual culture: social network sites, streaming websites, and multiplayer platforms. The project will also train graduate student researchers in methodological approaches for studying online cultures. <br/><br/>This research will be conducted in a densely trafficked virtual world. Virtual worlds are places where individuals interact with avatars in online environments. The investigators have conducted research in a virtual world context for over a decade, and thus have detailed baseline data with which to examine what is happening as a large number of individuals enter that virtual world due to the COVID-19 pandemic. What is the sudden move to virtual worlds doing in terms of social closeness and interaction? How does co-presence in virtual place transform intimacy and collaboration? How might this provide innovative strategies for preventing viral transmission, by forging new forms of social closeness in the context of physical distancing? To investigate these questions, the researchers will conduct participant observation, individual interviews, and group interviews. The study will compare individuals who have spent time in the virtual world for years with individuals who have entered the virtual world after COVID-19. Findings from this research will provide insight into the specific possibilities virtual worlds are providing in the circumstances of societies reshaped by COVID-19. In these new circumstances, virtual worlds will be one element of an online ecosystem linking drones, robots, and autonomous vehicles to mobile devices, social network sites, online games and streaming, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics. The research will thus provide a better understanding of the place of virtual worlds in this emerging online ecosystem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

435	Stephen Hilgartner	Cornell University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Collaborative Research: A Comparative Study of Expertise for Policy in the COVID-19 Pandemic	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - As policy makers work to avert catastrophic health and economic outcomes due to COVID 19, they are struggling with a difficult question: What makes expert knowledge credible, legitimate, and reliable for use in public policy? That question is especially urgent since national and regional authorities are facing scientific uncertainty and fast-moving events that cross geopolitical borders, and the need for quick action stands in tension with the need to ground policy in robust expert knowledge and convincing analysis. Ways of identifying trustworthy sources of expertise is essential, but they remain largely vested in governments with their differing institutions, research traditions, cultural commitments, and civic beliefs. The PIs will conduct a multi-sited investigation in ten regions that will capture detailed information about the COVID 19 crisis as it unfolds, and then conduct a rigorous comparative analysis to provide a better understanding of the relationship between expertise and trust, a critically important nexus for policy makers in an era of decentralized information and polarized politics. Effective dissemination of results to critical policy analysts and policy communities is key to the success of this project. To achieve this goal, the PIs will utilize the extensive connections that they and their collaborative partners have to science policymakers and national and international organizations.<br/><br/>The PIs have assembled a team of research partners, well established STS scholars in ten regions, who have agreed to participate in the project. This team will collect and analyze publications and public documents pertaining to COVID-19 policy making in each region. These materials will provide the basis for STS-based accounts of knowledge and policymaking in each region for the comparisons that are central to this project. To provide that account, they will build a basic policy timeline tracking key events and decisions in each region?s response to the pandemic. Tracking these moves will enable them to document change and analyze variations in how issues are framed and evidence is gathered. They will also collect information on uncertainties (such as scope and limitations of scientific knowledge) and controversies, with a focus on the most contentious aspect of coronavirus policy in each region. In addition, they will track carefully chosen objects as they are incorporated into policy discussions. Such objects include particularly influential epidemiological and epistemic models, widely circulated visual representations, key policy concepts, and knowledge claims about the availability, effectiveness, and future prospects of medical interventions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

436	Lauren Gardner	Johns Hopkins University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Development of an Interactive Web-based Dashboard to Track COVID-19 in Real-time	Engineering - This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) grant will be used to support the management and development of the COVID-19 online interactive dashboard hosted by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. The dashboard was first released publicly on January 22, 2020 to visualize and track the COVID-19 outbreak in real-time, and has since served as the prominent centralized source of COVID-19 epidemiological data throughout the COVID-19 outbreak to date. The dashboard illustrates the location and number of confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries for all affected countries, with additional features added over time. Further, all the data collected and displayed is made freely available to researchers, public health authorities and the general public in a GitHub repository, along with the feature layers of the dashboard. The availability of this data at the initial stages of the outbreak enabled the public health and research community to implement modeling tools, specifically the calibration of parameters for estimating transmission and spread at the earliest stages of the outbreak, when more formal situation reports were lagging, and thus gain a better understanding of the disease characteristics early on, which allowed for evidenced based decision making. Further, members of the public health community, including national and local level governmental organizations and public health offices around the world, continue to rely on the dashboard for informing, planning, and decision making regarding public safety, such as clinical staffing and resource allocation.<br/><br/>Given the popularity and impact of the dashboard to date, there is a need to continue to maintain it, and further build out its capabilities. Specifically, this includes the collection and curation process to capture data from a broader set of sources, enabling an increase in the spatial resolution (ideally to the city level) of the reporting. Introduction of additional features, including health-related context and confidence measures for the data and information presented, will increase the dashboard?s utility in supporting awareness and decision-making. Additional model and analytic research and development will enhance detection and classification, and more broadly, relative risk determination of events of concern from all sourced health related data. Longer term, systems engineering activities associated with this development will ensure an enduring capability established, vetted, and well-used prior to the next potential pandemic. Thus, the research efforts are critical to provide an early-warning system for future public health events, and help inform control measures in the current and future outbreaks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

437	Peter Bearman	Columbia University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: New York Covid-19 Chronicle and Oral History Archive	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - The COVID-19 pandemic is the gravest public health crisis the United States has faced since the Influenza pandemic of 1918, but it will not be the last. Disaster research is often by necessity retrospective, providing accounts of past actions and ongoing recoveries. The temporal profile of the COVID-19 pandemic presents an opportunity for social research in the middle of an unfolding crisis, providing contemporaneous insights into risk perception and sensemaking under duress, community and organizational resilience, transformations in social structure, and real time adaptations to severe economic and social dislocations. Concentrating on New York City, this project will create a contemporaneous record of the city?s battle with COVID-19 across the epidemic curve. New York is a critical site for understanding the course of this pandemic because it was an early epicenter of the disease in the U.S., because it has a robust municipal emergency management system with deep experience of past disasters, health-related and otherwise, and because it is home to one of the nation?s strongest urban healthcare systems. The project will provide real time findings about New York City that will be relevant to jurisdictions in earlier phases along the arc of the pandemic, thus assisting other governmental leaders in planning effective responses. This project will also rigorously document the COVID-19 emergency to better understand how it is unfolding, to better inform the recovery, and to learn lessons that will aid our fight against the next pandemic and other extreme events. These findings will be critical to leaders at all levels of government so as to promote the safety and security of U.S. residents in the years ahead.<br/><br/>The current COVID-19 pandemic challenges community and organizational resilience and necessitates transformations in social structure. To analyze these changes, this project combines three approaches to data gathering that capture the evolving and multi-dimensional impact of the COVID-19 crisis on New Yorkers. First, a survey of 1,000 people will track shifts in stress responses, helping behaviors, social isolation, and resilience. Demographic data gathered from the survey will inform and refine recruitment of new participants. The sample will be stratified across different scales of the response: everyday New Yorkers, frontline workers--including first and second responders, critical infrastructure and other essential workers--and strategic level decision makers, managers, and planners. These results will be complemented by data from a diary study with 500 participants, and a sequence of oral history interviews with 200 narrators at expanding intervals, to produce a rich longitudinal perspective on the relationship between micro shifts in attitudes and relations, and macro transformations in urban structures and dynamics.

438	Jeffrey Harden	University of Notre Dame	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	RAPID: Collaborative Research: The Diffusion of State Policy Responses to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - When the 2019 novel coronavirus arrived in the United States in February and March of 2020, state governments quickly began enacting policies intended to contain and mitigate its spread. Understanding the timing and sequence of these policy choices, and those policies? eventual consequences, is critical for assessing how governments can be most effective during pandemics. This project collects data on state and local governments? responses to COVID-19, including policies related to closing schools, canceling travel, banning public gatherings, closing restaurants and bars, delaying rent payments, and rules on medical licenses. This data allows researchers to examine the factors that influence states? policy choices, whether those factors differ from the ways in which states enact policies during normal times, which policies are effective in slowing the spread and morbidity of the virus, and how states roll back policies in a manner that allows economic activity to resume while maintaining preparedness to avoid and mitigated waves of the virus. <br/><br/>This project collects data on state government responses to COVID-19 by scraping government websites daily, focusing on sites dedicated to COVID-19 and those associated with the executive branch, state legislatures, and state departments of public health. It also collects data on the number of diagnosed cases, fatalities, recoveries in the states, and mobility data that tracks geographic movements from mobile phones. The policy recommendations or decisions recorded from state government pages include decisions related to closing schools, canceling travel, banning public gatherings (and their size), closing restaurants and bars, travel quarantines, postponing elections, safe shelter orders, limiting elective medical procedures, as well as when states modify these policies; additional data is collected from official state Twitter accounts. This data allows researchers to examine the factors that influence states? policy choices, whether those factors differ from the ways in which states enact policies during normal times, which policies are effective in slowing the spread and morbidity of the virus, and how states roll back policies in a manner that allows economic activity to resume while maintaining preparedness to avoid and mitigated waves of the virus. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Accountable Institutions and Behavior Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

439	Susan Tapert	University of California-San Diego	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Child Development in the ABCD Cohort	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - The coronavirus pandemic has affected children and families worldwide. In the US, schools and closed, yet there is variability across states and cities regarding pandemic recommendation on social distancing. The situation likely affects different children in different ways, due to varying levels of familial financial impact, self or family COVID-19 illness, mental health effects of social distancing and stress, online activity, scholastic activity, adult supervision, and indirect health influences of altered physical activity, sleep, and access to nutrition. The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development project (ABCD) is a longitudinal study of 11,878 diverse youth enrolled at ages 9-10 in 2016-2018 (birth years 2006-2009) at 21 research sites around the United States. This RAPID project will design and implement a new survey, to assess personal impact of COVID-19 on ABCD participants and families. With this new information, we can leverage existing ABCD data to examine perturbations in developmental trajectories of brain functioning, neurocognition, mental health, substance use, academic achievement, and social functioning. By immediately collecting a unique set of measures that characterize the pandemic?s effects, we can make use of the existing ABCD protocol and design in this large, diverse, national sample. Results from this study will provide substantially improved guidelines for future epidemics and pandemics, and indicate potential targets for interventions when other traumas affect children.<br/><br/>The ABCD cohort is being followed until at least age 20, with: biennial state-of-the-art neuroimaging, epigenetics/genetics, and physical activity tracking; annual cognitive testing and assessments with youth and parents on mental and physical health and development, life events and trauma exposure, culture and environment, substance use, sleep, and screen time; and biannual brief assessments of mental health and substance use. The proposed research would immediately characterize the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on each child via a youth and parent self-assessment that characterizes their personal level of family disruption, social distancing and its impact, attitudes, adherence to public health directives, and media exposure. This crisis provides a unique opportunity to make use of ABCD?s elaborate infrastructure and rigorous scientific processes to discern critical dimensions of behavior not previously envisioned. The impending severity of this unanticipated pandemic may result in significant influences on school-age youth for decades, and this RAPID will be critical to characterizing factors that protect and exacerbate its effects. This research will immediately examine COVID-19 related effects on youth, and how their practices around virus transmission and prevention vary as a function of family and social factors, external influences, and other characteristics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

440	Adam Ward	Indiana University	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	RAPID: Collaborative Research: Increased access to infrastructure for distance education in hydrologic science	Geosciences - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a sudden shift to online teaching for most universities in the United States, and many globally. With little time to prepare, water resource and hydrology professors and lecturers must generate online content rapidly for at least the spring and summer semesters of 2020, with an increasing possibility this format will extend into the fall 2020 term. At the same time, there is large variation in access to and preparation for online delivery among institutions and individual faculty. In the hydrologic sciences, we expect preparation for the transition to online instruction and the resultant learning to vary based on program size, institution, instructor experience, and availability of instructional support. Taken together, there is a significant risk that hydrologic instruction will divide into ?haves? and ?have nots? as a result of these critical differences. Equal access to critical support and instructional resources during the transition from traditional to distance learning in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is critical to closing this gap and providing equal access to high quality instruction in the hydrologic sciences. Thus, our goal is to enable access to educational infrastructure and training for instructors, and ultimately students, in the hydrologic sciences in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. <br/><br/>This project will implement six key activities to achieve our goal including: (1) facilitating two-way communication between instructors and students through panel discussions and survey templates; (2) enabling sharing of course materials through CUAHSI?s HydroShare platform; (3) developing open-source, data-driven educational resources; (4) developing a guest lecture database for hydrologic sciences; (5) community training and support using distance education materials and platforms; and (6) hosting a series of workshops and producing a synthesis report on distance education in the hydrologic sciences. The result of these activities will be a leveled playing field for accessible, quality education to all instructors and students in hydrologic science. Moreover, we expect these efforts to foster a community of online educators in hydrologic science who will develop and use educational resources that will persist well beyond the present COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the expanded use of distance education resources supports ongoing initiatives to expand Diversity, Equality, and Inclusion in the hydrologic sciences by CUAHSI and the HydroLearn platform to share undergraduate educational materials.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Hydrologic Sciences and Education and Human Resources programs in the Division of Earth Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

441	Runye Zha	Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute	None	2020-04-15	2021-03-31	RAPID: Polyelectrolyte Coatings as an Approach to Extend N95 Respirator Usage Lifespan	Engineering - This project will address the critical shortage of N95 respirator masks currently facing medical professionals at the front lines of the evolving novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The research will leverage the expertise of the investigators to develop a simple and effective approach for extending the usable life of N95 respirator masks and similar personal protective equipment (PPE). The investigators will explore the application of commercially available polyelectrolytes (a polymer with a repeating charged unit) as thin film coatings on the masks. These coatings can potentially deactivate enveloped viruses such as SARS-COV-2, increase the barrier to penetration by viral particles, and maintain performance integrity after solvent-based sterilization protocols. An independent laboratory will evaluate the performance of the modified masks relative to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) N95 standards. Clinical professionals at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, a region currently battling the highest infection rate, will test prototype masks and work with the investigators to perfect the coating procedure. The outcome of the project will be a coating protocol that uses non-toxic components and can be applied by end users in a hospital setting on procured masks. Findings will be made immediately accessible to the public through pre-print servers, public repositories such as the Open Science Framework, and social media platforms. Accordingly, society can work together to mitigate the impact of the PPE shortage and minimize further infections through clinician-patient contacts. <br/><br/>The overall goal of the project is to develop a simple and effective post-processing step to coat manufactured nonwoven polypropylene materials, e.g., N95 mask filters, in polyelectrolyte solutions. This is expected to impart a thin, uniform conformal coating exhibiting a semi-permanent charge. The polyelectrolyte coating will extend the usable life of existing medical PPE supplies by enabling use of common sterilization procedures. The polyelectrolyte coating may also augment the protective capabilities of PPE by enhancing material filtering efficiency and/or providing novel antiviral activity. The investigators will evaluate and optimize a coating procedure that healthcare personnel can directly apply to acquired PPE using commodity polymers. Incorporation of alkyl halides in the coating and polymer cross-linking will be explored to yield highly functional and resilient coatings. Scanning electron microscopy will be used to characterize coating uniformity, changes to material fiber structure, and resulting pore size distribution. Breathability after polymer coating will be assessed by measuring air permeation through the mask, and viral deactivation capabilities will be investigated through cytopathic and plaque formation assays with a model Biosafety Level II enveloped virus. An independent commercial laboratory will conduct NIOSH pre-certification testing to assess particle filtration relative to N-series respirator standards. Partners at the Mt. Sinai Icahn School of Medicine will test and implement prototypical processes in real time to resolve the PPE shortage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

442	Nicole Eikmeier	Grinnell College	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Collaborative Research: Quarantined Networks and the Spread of COVID-19	Mathematical and Physical Sciences - As the global community weighs the necessary extent of quarantine and social distancing to fight the spread of COVID-19, the critical question is how disease transmission is mitigated by these measures. Recent predictions suggest that without serious interventions, a large portion of the world population will become infected, resulting in millions of deaths. To mitigate this worst-case scenario, key policy decisions are being guided by mathematical models. However, several prominent models make unrealistic assumptions about human contacts i.e., that an individual is equally likely to infect a close family member as a complete stranger on the other side of the country. Such assumptions are useful for calculations, but fail to take into account the full geographic complexity of the outbreak. Furthermore, many models do not consider the consequences of the quarantine of healthy individuals. This project will use rigorous analysis and simulation to address these shortcomings by describing a more realistic structure of quarantined networks and how disease spreads in them. The proposed research will use real-world data about contact networks to make predictions and recommendations for controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, improving our understanding of how best to contain the current as well as future pandemics. The project will involve the training of undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This research will describe the effect of quarantine on connectivity and disease transmission on more realistic networks than have previously been considered. Of particular importance will be locating critical thresholds which, when exceeded, allow large epidemics to occur. There is recent study of these thresholds, but for networks that model digital infrastructure and social networks. The first objective of the research will be to determine the effect of biased site percolation on graph structure, especially how different percolation rules influence the size of the largest component of a given graph. The second part will then focus on how the critical threshold and size of the epidemic for an SIR model change after percolation. This will be explored rigorously on graphs generated from the configuration model as well as random spatial networks such as Gilbert graphs. Additionally, these questions will be investigated on real world face-to-face networks using data specific to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Answering them will help test robustness of previous models, while also exploring the effectiveness of stronger preemptive distancing.<br/><br/>This grant is being awarded using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

443	Abdennour Abbas	University of Minnesota-Twin Cities	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Rapid Assay for RNA Extraction and Concentration for COVID-19 Molecular Diagnostics	Engineering - Access to coronavirus testing is integral to the effort to curb and control the spread of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). COVID-19 diagnostic tests currently implement a technique called reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This technique requires two reagent kits. The first is used to extract the genetic material, ribonucleic acid (RNA), from the coronavirus, and the second is used to amplify the RNA to enable its detection with RT-PCR. The current diagnostic crisis is due, in part, to shortages of the RNA extraction kits and the time required to extract the RNA using the kits. Increasing both the availability and time-efficiency of these kits is vital to improve testing accessibility and enhance the reliability of clinical diagnostics. In this project, a novel process for producing porous sorbent materials will be used to develop an alternative extraction kit for efficient and rapid extraction of nucleic acids from patient samples. The performance will be further optimized by studying the molecular mechanisms governing nucleic acid capture and release by the sorbents and applying this fundamental knowledge. The development and clinical validation of a novel extraction kit will be followed by mass production, addressing the current shortage and improving access to COVID-19 testing. The close collaboration between engineers developing the diagnostic technologies and clinicians implementing the prototypes, as enabled by this project, will streamline the transition of scientific knowledge into solutions that benefit the health and well-being of society. The project will also provide workforce development opportunities through training researchers in novel diagnostic techniques for coronaviruses.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a novel, scalable approach to nucleic acid separation and concentration and mass-produce prototype kits for immediate implementation in clinical settings. The concept relies on the use of sorbent materials instead of the current filter- and silica column-based approach. Unlike filters that use pore size to physically separate the target (here nucleic acids) from the media, sorbents are a porous material that captures the target by chemical affinity and interactions. As a result, the use of a sorbent enables larger water flow rates, enhanced nucleic acid capture efficiency, and faster sample processing, and overcomes the need for multiple buffers or extraction steps. Functionalization of conventional filters with a combination of metal oxide nanoparticles and organosiloxane polymers will be used to produce the nucleic acid sorbent. The functionalization will be achieved by a new method for supported synthesis of nanoparticles by thermolysis and polymer conjugation. The efficiency of the sorbent will be assessed by the extraction and detection of nucleic acid using quantitative RT-PCR. Validation of the alternative sorbent kit will assess the effectiveness of the rapid separation and concentration of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) RNA. The project will also explore the fundamentals of nucleic acid dynamics in porous sorbents as it relates to nucleic acid size, sorbent chemistry, porosity and pore size, and the effect of transport phenomena in porous media. Enhanced understanding of the factors that affect the retention, release, and transport of nucleic acids in porous media is critical to producing reliable and efficient nucleic acid extraction and detection kits and the development of other bio-separation processes. Training of postdoctoral researchers and graduate and undergraduate students will focus on how the combination of transdisciplinary collaboration and a clear understanding of the fundamental aspects can lead to disruptive technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

444	Christopher Hulleman	University of Virginia Main Campus	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	RAPID: A mixed-method investigation of the role of faculty mindset beliefs during the transition to online education as compelled by the COVID-19 pandemic	Education and Human Resources - The transition to online instruction necessitated by the COVID pandemic has created significant uncertainty for the nation?s college faculty, many of whom have not previously taught online. This research would examine how faculty mindsets about themselves and their students, as well as faculty perceptions of their university/college system?s messages about the transition, relate to their responses to the challenge of rapidly transitioning their teaching online, the quality of instruction they deliver, and, as a result, students? attitudes and learning outcomes in STEM courses during the Spring 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Given the high levels of stress caused by the disruption to daily life brought by COVID-19, faculty attitudes and beliefs may be critical in determining the pattern of faculty responses, and in particular, whether and how they adapt and transition their courses online. Faculty responses may reflect deep-seated beliefs about (a) the nature of STEM content (as relatively fixed and unchanging); (b) the view of themselves as simply deliverers of that relatively fixed content, and (c) students? abilities to learn STEM material. Understanding how faculty mindsets influence the teaching practices that STEM faculty adopt as they move their teaching online ? and how these practices influence students? motivation, learning, and performance ? can help faculty become more adaptable in the future by developing professional development in advance. This award is made by the EHR Core Research program in the Division of Human Resource Development, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.<br/><br/>This study will build on an existing partnership between the Motivate Lab, based at the University of Virginia, and the University System of Georgia, which includes 26 four-year colleges and universities throughout Georgia. The 26 institutions in Georgia are divided roughly equally into four sectors: Research-intensive, Masters-comprehensive, State university, and State college. This variation in institution type will be important to consider as attitudes towards teaching (vs. research) and the type of students vary significantly across the system, with the more research-focused institutions being more selective in their admissions policies. Participants will include 900 faculty across the University System of Georgia and the students enrolled in their courses. Retooled surveys, course artifacts, learning management system data, and administrative data will capture how faculty mindsets about themselves and their students, as well as faculty perceptions of their system?s messages about the transition, relate to their responses to the challenge of rapidly transitioning their teaching online, the quality of instruction they deliver, and students? attitudes and learning outcomes in STEM courses during the Spring 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Supplementary student data will assess student perceptions about the changes that faculty made to their instructional practices during the move to online, and the changes to the quality of the learning experience. Although prior research demonstrates that faculty mindsets shape teaching practices even under normal circumstances, this research will test hypotheses about whether mindset beliefs will especially matter during periods of rapidly changing circumstances. Learning how faculty mindsets matter will significantly advance theory and understanding of the role of faculty mindsets in STEM education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

445	Gautam Dasarathy	Arizona State University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Active Tracking of Disease Spread in CoVID19 via Graph Predictive Analytics	Computer and Information Science and Engineering - Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a public health crisis of global proportions. As of April 10, 2020, there are approximately 1.7 million confirmed COVID-19 cases in more than 180 countries, with over 100,000 deaths. In the US, there are more than 500,000 confirmed cases and nearly 20,000 fatalities, and these numbers are continuing to rise sharply. There is a clear and acute need for ensuring the availability of infrastructure and critical services as the epidemic progresses. Current plans for controlling the epidemic are based on forecasts from well established ?compartment? models for epidemic prediction. These models rely on differential equations based on assumptions of homogeneous populations, homogeneous mixing, and knowledge of several critical hyperparameters such as the base reproduction rate. It is well known among experts in infectious diseases and epidemic management that fitting observed data to the parameters of such models is an exercise in characterizing the epidemiology as opposed to generating valid and actionable predictions. Consequently, there is an urgent need to significantly update these models to account for the data collected on the ground from multiple data sources and locations. This is especially relevant in engineering preemptive interventions to check disease spread. Current COVID disease data are organized in a geospatial format, i.e., infected, deceased, and suspected cases indexed by geolocation, which can range from city-, county-, or state-level coarseness. This project aims to develop and demonstrate techniques that use the geospatial nature of the data, the temporal evolution of disease statistics (along with predictions), and synthesis of multiple sources of data to help rapidly and preemptively allocate available medical resources toward the areas of greatest need. <br/> <br/>Modeling the COVID-19 epidemic and designing interventions are significant challenges. This project looks at the problem through the lens of graph analytics. In particular, it seeks to use similarity information between geospatial regions of interest to improve epidemic predictions and to design effective interventions. As a first step, the problem of epidemic prediction is being modeled as the reconstruction of a high-dimensional dynamical system from low-dimensional observations. The estimates of a model thus learned will be enhanced by leveraging similarity information between the localities of interest. While the geospatial proximity graph is a natural candidate for the graph of similarities, it fails to capture long-range statistical dependencies between geographical regions based on other factors such as the sociological and biological features of a population. Using techniques from graphical modeling, this project will develop new techniques for learning statistically meaningful graphs for epidemic modeling during an ongoing pandemic. Furthermore, the accurate time-series prediction generated will be combined with the graph-based similarity measures to design effective interventions to check the spread of the epidemic. This is being approached using a stochastic formulation and emerging methods for anomaly detection on graphs with time series observations; optimal policies based on these paradigms will be translated into interventional strategies for an evolving pandemic. The project leverages partnerships with local community stakeholders in Maricopa County and the State of Arizona through the Knowledge Exchange for Resilience (KER) to implement the methodologies developed, and to ensure its technical advances can produce meaningful insights that can generalize nationally and globally.<br/> <br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

This award funds studies by Drs. Mihaela-Rita Mihailescu and Jeffrey D. Evanseck at Duquesne University in to determine the structures and signals in the RNA that control the progression of the virus through various stages of its life cycle. Drs. Mihailescu and Evanseck use biophysical and computational methods to determine how structures of distantly separated parts of the RNA interact to switch from early stage protein production to late stage virus production. In addition, the project studies how conserved structures bring two separate RNAs together to allow parts to swap between genomes through a process called recombination. This recombination process provides an understanding for how the SARS-CoV-2 genome may have arisen from the exchange of genetic material among RNAs from viruses that infect different mammalian species. The impact of the project on society is to identify potential inhibitors against RNA-RNA interactions, which further provides leads for the development of therapeutic interventions against the SARS-CoV-2 virus and, correspondingly, stem the COVID-19 pandemic.<br/><br/>This goal of this study is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms controlling the progression of SARS-CoV-2 through essential steps of its life cycle and unravel a new, unexplored mechanism of RNA genomic dimerization that might facilitate its recombination. This research guides future development of new antivirals that target the genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 and potentially other similar RNA viruses. Bioinformatics and biophysical methods, including fluorescence spectroscopy, will be applied to elucidate the function of a highly conserved s2m RNA motif and to probe the long-range RNA-RNA interactions between the conserved sequences in the 5?- and 3?-untranslated regions (UTRs) of viral genes. The s2m RNA motif is proposed to form a ?kissing complex? intermediate that mediates dimerization of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome, thereby facilitating recombination events in coronaviruses and other additional viral families that share this motif. The UTRs are proposed to form "kissing interactions" that mediate the genome circularization, molecular switch that controls the transition between the translation and replication viral life cycle steps.<br/><br/>This grant is being awarded using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

447	Melissa Finucane	Rand Corporation	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	RAPID: Perceived Risk and Impacts of COVID-19 in Socially Vulnerable Urban Neighborhoods	Engineering - The COVID-19 pandemic is requiring unprecedented response policies, including stay-at-home orders, closing of schools and non-essential businesses and services, and travel restrictions. As these policies are implemented, profound residential segregation in the US also creates differences in the backdrop of conditions faced by lower-income, minority communities, compared with others. Understanding how housing conditions, neighborhood socioeconomic conditions, access to basic services, and community sentiment affects people?s experiences of the pandemic is important because reducing the spread of the disease and burden on the public health system depends critically on people staying at home. This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project will examine how characteristics of built and social environments influence the impacts of COVID-19 and associated response policies on risk perceptions, mental health, financial well-being, and food security for residents in disinvested, racially isolated, urban areas. Our approach advances the science of risk perception and models of community vulnerability and resilience. The data and insights will help policymakers to target assistance toward individuals and neighborhoods most in need of support during the COVID-19 pandemic. This research will also assist planning for post-pandemic recovery among the most vulnerable in US society.<br/><br/>The project builds on an existing longitudinal panel study of residents in two neighborhoods participating in the Pittsburgh Hill/Homewood Research on Neighborhoods and Health (PHRESH). The randomly selected PHRESH cohort comprises 1,000 households for which data have been collected since 2011 on food security and access, home conditions, resilience, physical and mental health, social cohesion, and extensive sociodemographic data. A randomly selected subsample of 500 individuals from the PHRESH cohort will be administered a telephone survey that includes new questions about: COVID-19 illness and policy experiences; neighborhood perceptions and satisfaction; cognitive, affective, and behavioral elements of perceived risk; and impacts on mental health, financial well-being, and food security. This project will test the hypotheses that COVID-19 and associated policies impact risk responses, mental health outcomes, financial well-being, and food security, with 1) social and built environment characteristics either amplifying or reducing (i.e., moderating) the effect of COVID-19 and 2) community sentiment such as neighborhood perceptions and satisfaction potentially explaining (i.e., mediating) any significant associations between COVID-19 and study outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

448	Omar Farha	Northwestern University	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	RAPID: Regenerable Antiviral Nanoporous Materials for Protection	Mathematical and Physical Sciences - Non-Technical Abstract<br/><br/>With over 2 million positive cases and 160 thousand deaths as of mid-April 2020, global society is currently suffering physically, socially, economically, and politically because of the ongoing pandemic outbreak - Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The main pathway that the virus is spreading is through respiratory droplets produced when people sneeze or cough, which can then infect people nearby. Thus, the United States? Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended covering one?s face to help slow down the spread of the virus. The traditional face masks, however, can only act as a physical barrier, which means that the virus will stay active on the mask and can still be transmitted if touched while removing/wearing the mask. Therefore, developing face masks to deactivate the viral threats can efficiently stop/slow the spread of the highly infectious virus, COVID-19. With funding from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, this Rapid Response Research (RAPID) grant supports research that focuses on developing antiviral masks by chemically modifying the textile surfaces to deactivate the viral threats; this in turn reduces the risk of spreading the virus and generates reusable masks. The research serves the national interest and NSF?s mission by developing advanced technologies from hypothesis-driven scientific research to protect our nation?s physical, social, economic, and political health and welfare.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) grant supports research that employs nanoporous materials to modify textile fibers and generate antiviral facial masks with funding from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate. The support enables a materials science approach that mitigates the negative impacts of COVID-19 on public health. Masks that not only protect the wearer but also deactivate the virus significantly reduce the spread of infectious viral threats such as COVID-19 since an active virus residing on a mask still possesses a great threat to the wearer and their environment. This research project investigates means to cover the surfaces of textile fibers with antiviral agents that are active towards viral threats; in this way, the viruses can be deactivated by disintegration upon contact and/or post-treatment while filtered air is allowed to pass through the mask safely. Specifically, the researchers employ the integration of metal?organic framework based antiviral composites on textiles-based facial masks and later on N95 or similar masks. The protective nano layer added on the masks enables the disintegration of the viral threats, which allows the reuse of masks due to reduction of cross contamination during removal and/or wearing of the masks. This RAPID project offers a solution to the severely urgent challenge of the shortage of effective antiviral protective materials while advancing physical and materials science and educating the general public on the research-driven solutions to global challenges.<br/><br/>This grant is being awarded using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

449	Pedro Alvarez	William Marsh Rice University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Molecular Imprinting of Coronavirus Attachment Factors to Enhance Disinfection by a Selective Photocatalytic ?Trap-and-Zap? Approach	Engineering - The virus that causes COVID-19 (i.e., SARS-CoV-2) has been found in air ducts, suggesting that it could spread around buildings via air conditioning systems. SARS-CoV-2 is also shed in stool despite patients testing negative, and thus it may reach wastewater treatment plants, where it could survive for days and be aerosolized or discharged in the effluent. In fact, there are reports that SARS-CoV-2 may spread through bathroom pipes. Although coronaviruses can be inactivated by some conventional water treatment processes, there is an urgent need for more precise viral disinfection approaches that are fast, efficient and reliable under realistic scenarios. The objective of this project is to develop a novel approach for selective adsorption and photocatalytic disinfection (i.e., trap-and-zap) of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogenic coronaviruses. This would result in a chemical-free technology (thus avoiding harmful disinfection byproducts) with unprecedented precision and reliable efficiency to inactivate coronavirus. The driving hypothesis is that molecular imprinting of graphitic carbon nitride with common coronavirus attachment factors will enable selective virus adsorption near reactive sites, resulting in reliably high disinfection. Whereas enhancing the capacity and resiliency of wastewater disinfection and hospital air sterilization systems to protect public health against emerging infectious diseases has significant intrinsic merit, the benefits of this project are much broader. This project will enhance surface recognition of various types of coronavirus (e.g., those causing COVID-19, MERS and SARS), which will inform efforts to concentrate them and improve both precision separation (e.g., by superior sorbents) and detection limits of sensors that can be used in diagnostics and surveillance efforts. Project results will be integrated into various courses, including the NanoEnvironmental Engineering for Teachers (NEET) course at Rice, which enrolls 15 teachers that reach over 3,300 high school students annually. This course recently expanded to Arizona State University and is also being expanded to the University of Texas at El Paso, thereby ensuring wide dissemination of this ?trap-and-zap? approach to STEM teachers.<br/><br/>This project builds on a recently published, nanotechnology-enabled ?trap-and-zap? approach (enhanced by molecular imprinting), to selectively adsorb antibiotic resistant genes and concentrate them near photocatalytic sites for efficient degradation (doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b06926). This approach will be modified to target SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus by imprinting molecules involved in virus attachment such as sialic acids, heparin sulfate proteoglycan, and angiotensin-converting enzyme?related carboxypeptidase (ACE2)-associated peptides onto the graphitic carbon nitride photocatalysts. When the imprinted molecule is removed (e.g., by acid washing), it leaves behind a target-specific cavity that enables selective adsorption and photocatalytic inactivation with minimum interference by background water constituents. Low pathogenic coronavirus HCoV-NL63 (which, similarly to SARS-CoV 2, is enveloped with an S spike protein and uses the same cell surface molecule ACE2 as host receptor) will be used to assess adsorption kinetics and selectivity of molecularly imprinted-gC3N4 in the presence of competing proteins (such as bovine serum albumin) and bacteriophage MS2. Inactivation efficiency will be assessed by quantifying residual viable virus concentrations, using the plaque assay with Avicel overlay. Specific tasks include to (1) select a model coronavirus (e.g., HCoV-NL63) and attachment factors for molecular imprinting; (2) prepare homogenous, stable, biomolecular materials for imprinting; (3) synthesize the molecularly-imprinted catalyst; (4) characterize adsorption kinetics and selectivity of target coronavirus particles to the molecularly-imprinted catalyst; (5) benchmark virus inactivation efficiency of the molecularly imprinted -coated catalyst against traditional disinfection methods (chlorination, ultraviolet irradiation) under realistic conditions; and (6) assess durability and reuse potential of the molecularly imprinted catalyst Project results will be integrated into various courses, including the NanoEnvironmental Engineering for Teachers (NEET) course at Rice, which enrolls 15 teachers that reach over 3,300 high school students annually.

Approach	Engineering - The virus that causes COVID-19 (i.e., SARS-CoV-2) has been found in air ducts, suggesting that it could spread around buildings via air conditioning systems. SARS-CoV-2 is also shed in stool despite patients testing negative, and thus it may reach wastewater treatment plants, where it could survive for days and be aerosolized or discharged in the effluent. In fact, there are reports that SARS-CoV-2 may spread through bathroom pipes. Although coronaviruses can be inactivated by some conventional water treatment processes, there is an urgent need for more precise viral disinfection approaches that are fast, efficient and reliable under realistic scenarios. The objective of this project is to develop a novel approach for selective adsorption and photocatalytic disinfection (i.e., trap-and-zap) of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogenic coronaviruses. This would result in a chemical-free technology (thus avoiding harmful disinfection byproducts) with unprecedented precision and reliable efficiency to inactivate coronavirus. The driving hypothesis is that molecular imprinting of graphitic carbon nitride with common coronavirus attachment factors will enable selective virus adsorption near reactive sites, resulting in reliably high disinfection. Whereas enhancing the capacity and resiliency of wastewater disinfection and hospital air sterilization systems to protect public health against emerging infectious diseases has significant intrinsic merit, the benefits of this project are much broader. This project will enhance surface recognition of various types of coronavirus (e.g., those causing COVID-19, MERS and SARS), which will inform efforts to concentrate them and improve both precision separation (e.g., by superior sorbents) and detection limits of sensors that can be used in diagnostics and surveillance efforts.

The project at Bethune Cookman University seeks to investigate the effects of two educational interventions on the robust learning measures of long-term retention or desire for future learning of COVID-19 knowledge. It will produce designers of effective, efficient, and engaging distance learning while equipping undergraduate students and informal learners with relevant skills and competencies to contribute transdisciplinary solutions to the current COVID-19 and future disease outbreaks. Undergraduate students are involved as researchers in this project.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to understand how to optimize the successful learning of knowledge content types such as procedures for data associated problem solving activities, especially in the circumstances of mandatory remote education. The abundance of data resources resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic presents unique conditions suitable to design and develop educational technology interventions for learning procedures to solve data challenges in areas of data flow, data curation, and data analytics. The research is guided by the Knowledge-Learning-Instruction theoretical framework for producing robust student learning. Two online educational technology interventions will be developed and investigated among cohorts of designers of learning experiences on generating knowledge from complex data resources on COVID-19 pandemic, and among informal learners of the genomics and environmental survival of coronaviruses. An ?in vivo? experimentation approach will be implemented that combines causal principles and real online instructional events with or without an ecological control group. The transactions and artifacts of learning events will be analyzed to detect features that predict robust learning and the performance of complex cognitive activities. Post-educational intervention assessments will capture academic and professional success measures including satisfaction with the learning process, self-confidence to work effectively with complex datasets, desire to pursue data careers, and involvement in developing data-driven solutions to COVID-19 pandemic. <br/><br/>This RAPID award is made by the Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program in the Division of Human Resource Development, Directorate of Education and Human Resources, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

This technology, which has been used to significantly improve lateral flow assays for HIV, malaria, Strep and influenza, will enable widespread, inexpensive (< $1/test), rapid (? 10 minutes), point-of-care detection of COVID-19. Such detection does not exist and cannot exist using the current methodologies for detecting both early (i.e. viral protein) and late (i.e. antibody) stages of COVID-19 infection. These new, thermal contrast lateral flow assays, along with new thermal contrast ?reading? technology, will accelerate effective and targeted testing and surveillance of disease spread and management and bring enormous benefits to both national and global society. While first deployment will be in clinical settings, it is envisioned that this technology can eventually be used at schools, airports, sporting and entertainment events and even at home to assess the infection and spread of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.<br/><br/>The proposed research will develop new lateral flow assays to be used with innovative thermal contrast technology for highly sensitive, inexpensive, point-of-care detection of COVID-19. This new paradigm will, in the long term, be applied to a wide variety of diseases. Lateral flow assays are arguably the cheapest, fastest and easiest to use rapid diagnostic assays in the world. While they are used qualitatively for numerous diseases, they have weaknesses that include lack of sensitivity and quantification of disease burden. Both of these issues are addressed through our novel Thermal Contrast Assay technology. To address this specifically for COVID-19, two approaches are proposed: 1) optimizing gold nanoparticles and lateral flow assays for binding either COVID-19 protein or COVID-19 antibody analytes, and 2) the use of a new quantitative figure of merit called the ?Binding Ratio? to rapidly identify reagents and components for optimized thermal contrast lateral flow assays. This project is part of a larger effort with industry partners to scale up the manufacturing of a proprietary thermal contrast reader so that it will be affordable for point-of-care clinical settings such as doctors? offices, urgent care settings, emergency rooms, and field hospitals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

From A Community Perspective	Engineering - This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project examines the impacts of COVID-19 on small businesses, and how they and their communities react to and cope with associated challenges. Small businesses currently account for 99.9 percent of US firms and employ 47.5 percent of all US workers. Yet, small businesses are more likely to be economically vulnerable, be under-insured, and less likely to have contingency plans. In particular, small businesses in underrepresented communities and peripheral areas face formidable barriers and challenges in preparing for and responding to emergencies and social or natural disasters. This study?s interdisciplinary approach and analytical results will help public policy address disparity and inequality issues, in particular the opportunities and challenges facing small business owners. In addition, it unpacks one facet of community recovery ? the importance of businesses? ability to continue operating and employing people. Therefore, the study will enhance knowledge about how empowering local businesses, increasing diverse employment opportunities, and enhancing private sector enterprises' adaptive capacity contribute to broader community-level resilience.<br/><br/>This project examines small business vulnerability and resilience through small businesses? responses to COVID-19 and their adaptation practices within communities, drawing upon data gathered from business surveys and in-depth interviews. It also explores different approaches to risk mitigation and business preparedness intended to enhance their future resilience. This study goes beyond the traditional lens of physical and financial resources, emphasizing the strength of community-based networks in helping small businesses promptly respond to disasters, and how these networks influence the links between economic and social, and between individual and community resilience. It examines a broad spectrum of businesses under the impacts of social and public health crisis, and particularly highlights the role of social inequalities, unemployment, and low income as a critical source of vulnerability and lack of resilience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

454	Byron Erath	Clarkson University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Speech as a modality for airborne transport of virus-laden droplets in the COVID-19 pandemic	Engineering - This RAPID project will advance the understanding of how infectious diseases are spread from speaking, which is directly relevant to informing decisions regarding social distancing measures in the current COVID-19 pandemic. During regular conversation, small virus-laden droplets are generated in the respiratory and vocal tract. They are then expelled into the surrounding environment as airflow exits the mouth. Larger droplets may impact surfaces in the immediate vicinity, while smaller ones may stay suspended in the air as aerosols for long periods of time. Both types of expiratory droplets pose an infection risk. Larger droplets may land directly on individuals that are in close proximity, while smaller aerosolized particles are capable of traveling longer distances and infecting people much farther away by being inhaled into the respiratory tract. Currently, the range of distances that particles travel when produced by speech, and the resulting infection risk posed to individuals in the immediate (near field) and more distant (far field) vicinity, is not well understood. The potential for increased infection risk due to prolonged speech in indoor environments, where airborne particles may accumulate over time and reach higher concentrations, is also not known. This research proposal aims to answer these questions by performing physical measurements of speech in tandem with numerical modeling of droplet transport to predict infection risks in both the near and far field of an infected speaker.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to determine how virus-laden droplets are spread during speech. Particular emphasis is placed on investigating specific vocal intonations that produce high velocity bursts of air at the mouth (i.e., fricatives and plosives), which are hypothesized to propel particles over relatively long distances and increase infection risk in both the near and far field. Experimental velocity field measurements of the human mouth jet will be acquired using particle image velocimetry for sustained vowels, fricatives, and plosives, at varying levels of loudness. Separately, aerodynamic particle size spectrometry will measure the droplet size distributions generated by these same utterances. These data will be used to validate and inform an unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes computational fluid dynamics model that adopts an Eulerian-Lagrangian approach to model and quantify droplet dynamics. Coupling the expiratory velocity fields and particle dynamics for specific speech utterances will facilitate predicting the infection risk arising from voiced speech by using viral titer levels and infectious doses for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Near and far field infection risks will be quantified for both open and confined surroundings, where the competing times scales associated with ventilation, particle settling, and virus inactivation rates, will influence the steady-state particle accumulation. Mitigation strategies to decrease infection risk in indoor environments will also be explored.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

A surge in demand for specialized healthcare has also created a shortage of skilled medical professionals capable of operating highly technical machines while protecting themselves and others against this dangerous virus. Thus, providing rapid training for caregivers and increasing the supply of Personal Protective Equipment and medical technology is an immediate priority for combating this unprecedented pandemic. This project will leverage the research and technology currently under development in a National Science Foundation Convergence Accelerator project to provide an easy to use and access training application for caregivers, as well as networking capacity for problem-solving among stakeholders. This project will also build and foster partnerships among the healthcare community, medical equipment manufacturers and distributors, and grassroots efforts to rapidly deploy prototypes as it strives to create awareness of the project and its novel features.<br/><br/>The specific goals of this project are to provide training support, problem-solving resources, and professional networking for idea exchanges for healthcare professionals, caregivers, and technologists that are on the frontlines in the fight against COVID-19. Artificial Intelligence techniques such as deep learning and self-adaptive autonomous systems will be used to develop an intelligent knowledge network to support virtual communities, as well as, create Augmented Reality technologies for delivering efficient and engaging virtual training. Thus, the research objectives of this project include: 1) development of an Augmented Reality training mobile application for caregivers and technologists responding to the COVID-19 pandemic; 2) deployment of an online repository for equipment problem-solving resources; and 3) development of a professional networking application to disseminate research and best practices in the fight against COVID-19 for all stakeholders engaged in addressing the pandemic. The project's overarching focus is to create a web application with mobile Augmented Reality capability for training healthcare professionals at any location and time, in order to improve access to training with the medical equipment and increase the efficiency and reach of safety training. The project team will advance the knowledge base in computer science and spatial computing as it creates its Artificial Intelligence-powered Augmented Reality training.

456	Barbara Means	Digital Promise Global	None	2020-05-15	2020-12-31	RAPID: Addressing Equity when STEM Teaching and Learning Go Remote	Education and Human Resources - A systemic and persistent digital divide exists between students with limited resources and students with more resources. This project will investigate the challenges students face with the unexpected migration of their STEM courses to online environments due to COVID-19. Prior research on online learning suggests that students with limited financial means and fewer academic experiences are at a disadvantage when learning in online educational environments. To better understand student experiences and consequences of teaching and learning in digital environments, the project will address four questions: How do students? experiences in gateway STEM courses compare pre- and post the shift to online learning? Which challenges to learning STEM online are more prevalent among low-income, underrepresented minority, and rural students compared to other students? What online instructional practices do students perceive as contributing to their engagement and learning? To what extent do different types of digital learning experiences or other variables mitigate the challenges associated with the COVID-19-induced transition to remote STEM learning? <br/><br/>The mixed method research study will: (a) survey a nationally representative sample of 1,000 undergraduate students from two- and four-year colleges who are taking STEM courses that transitioned to remote delivery in spring 2020; and (2) conduct case studies to examine pre- and post-COVID-19 student and faculty experiences in gateway STEM courses at institutions serving underserved student populations. The research team will prepare response distributions and descriptive statistics for each item for the Student Survey and for key subgroups. Additionally, exploratory correlational analyses will be conducted to understand relationships between variables. To assess subgroups or before-and-after differences on items and item scales, ANOVAs, t-tests, and Chi-square tests will be used. Multivariate regression analyses will explore potential causal relationships among the data. Thematic analyses of student and faculty interviews and student focus groups will be conducted using a priori codes derived from the literature and topics of interest, as well as thematic codes that emerge from the data using an inductive approach. A hierarchy of themes will be created to facilitate analyses that disaggregate themes and trends for key subgroups. Results from this research will provide information to the higher education community and policy makers that can inform plans to address the current crisis, as well as how to incorporate lessons learned in STEM education post-COVID-19.

457	Yuanxiong Guo	University of Texas at San Antonio	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Collaborative: Location Privacy Preserving COVID-19 Symptom Map Construction via Mobile Crowdsourcing for Proactive Constrained Resource Allocation	Computer and Information Science and Engineering - The recent pandemic of COVID-19 has caused a public health crisis to US and many other countries in the world. Since there is currently no medication to treat COVID-19, the most challenging question is how to effectively allocate constrained healthcare resources to the next potential outburst communities or areas, so that we can halt or even prevent the virus' further spreading. The current reactive efforts of relying on people to visit their doctors or testing stations for collecting infection data may not work in an efficient and timely manner due to the limited coverage, high cost, and increased exposure risk for people to be congested at those places. This project develops a fine-grained and location privacy-preserving COVID19 symptom map (CSM) via mobile crowdsourcing, where the symptoms may include fever, cough, or shortness of breath. The proposed CSM is promising in its ability to identify the potential outbreak areas and facilitate the proactive and dynamic allocation of healthcare resources. Meanwhile, the location privacy preserving feature will protect the mobile crowdsourcing participants from bias or discrimination, encouraging them to participate for the public good. The project involves synergized efforts from mobile crowdsourcing, public health science, data analytics, privacy, and social science. Education and outreach activities are designed to increase the participation of women and minority in science and engineering. <br/><br/>This project develops an interdisciplinary framework for location privacy preservation, mobile crowdsourcing, data analytics, social science, and public health science, and contains a research plan with four interconnected thrusts. First, a novel location differential privacy preservation mechanism named differentially private hexagonal hierarchical geospatial indexing system (DPH3) will be developed, which can well represent physical community structure in the map, guarantee mobile crowdsourcing participants? location differential privacy, and provide high mobile crowdsourcing utility for CSM construction in terms of map coverage and accuracy. Second, a coverage-aware crowdsourcing participant recruitment scheme based on DPH3 and approximation algorithm will be designed to guarantee the crowdsensing coverage while preserving participants' location differential privacy. Third, a quality-assured CSM will be constructed by using virus propagation model as the prior knowledge for detrending in ordinary kriging and robust estimation for mitigating the impact of location privacy preserving noises added by DPH3. Fourth, a strategic communication approach to community engagement from the perspective of social science will be used to motivate community members? activeness in information seeking and sharing about COVID-19 symptoms, facilitate crowdsourcing needed for the CSM, as well as empower the community members.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

The model focuses on compliance with mitigation strategies and public health guidelines, thus enabling the selection of policies that are most effective in promoting both the progress of science and advancing national health and prosperity. Various pandemic models are currently being used to predict the spread of a virus and establish which mitigation strategies are the most effective. These models are heavily based on assumptions and may include an oversimplified reality of how populations react and behave. This research will provide needed knowledge and methods for the development of a model of how individuals in the U.S. react to certain mitigation strategies, such as social-distancing, stay-at-home orders, quarantines, and travel advisories, by mining and analyzing social media data during the COVID-19 crisis. This enhanced modeling approach and its resultant model will be of great value to disaster response managers and policy/decision makers to understand human social behavior. This work allows assessment of the effectiveness of mitigation strategies and public health guidelines during pandemics (and other crises). This project will also form the basis of a publicly available case study suitable for university level students that can be widely incorporated in courses. <br/><br/>Although individual-based and homogeneous mixing pandemic models provide useful insights and predictive capabilities within a range of possibilities, they are highly sensitive to people?s actions. This research aims to provide an enhanced approach to model social behavior and community activity during a pandemic in terms of compliance with mitigation strategies and public health guidelines. Social media data present a brief window of opportunity for research on how, and to what extent, the public does or does not comply with the recommended mitigation strategies and public health guidelines. The research team will collect real-time data from social media related to COVID19-exposed regional populations in the U.S. The data will be analyzed using machine learning techniques to identify non-mutually exclusive clusters of people based on similarity of their demographic, geographic, and time information, and establish relationships among clusters. The analyzed data will form the basis of a data-driven multi-paradigm simulation model that captures changes in public sentiment over time, quantifies the resistance/compliance with mitigation strategies and health guidelines, and gauges overall effectiveness of various mitigation strategies and advice over time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

459	Kristin Horan	The University of Central Florida Board of Trustees	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	RAPID: Collaborative Proposal: Effects of Institutional Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic on Undergraduate Faculty and Students Across STEM Disciplines	Education and Human Resources - The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in unprecedented, nation-wide disruption of academic institutions. As a result, there is an urgent need to understand the acute effects of this disruption on undergraduate STEM education in the U.S. This project will examine experiences of faculty and students resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent institutional changes. Initiated during a time of uncertainty, this project will: (1) capture the ephemeral nature of undergraduate education experiences before national recovery milestones are achieved; and (2) inform efforts to adapt undergraduate STEM education during crises. The project team will collect data about institutional characteristics and crisis communication messages, as well as about experiences of individual faculty and students. These data will be analyzed to identify pathways through which the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced teaching and learning within undergraduate STEM education. The findings of this project will be used to develop actionable recommendations for institutions of higher education, including crisis communication strategies, guidelines for pedagogy in times of crisis, and checklists of resources. As the STEM workforce plays a critical role in the economic health of the U.S. in normal and disaster situations, this effort to rapidly collect data and learn from this situation will contribute to the security and well-being of society. It is expected that the results will also support a more resilient, globally competitive next generation of STEM workers. <br/><br/>The project?s specific aims are to: (1) examine teaching and learning experiences of undergraduate faculty and students in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) examine the effects of faculty and student reactions on undergraduate STEM teaching and learning; and (3) leverage findings to develop actionable recommendations for colleges and universities to best prepare and protect their faculty, staff, and students and the integrity of undergraduate STEM education. The goal of these activities is to answer key research questions: How do institutions? COVID-19 policies influence faculty and student attitudes, perceptions, and behavior related to STEM teaching and learning? What teaching and learning resources were most important for undergraduate STEM faculty and students? How do these effects on undergraduate STEM education develop over time? Given the rapidly changing nature of the situation, individual-level data that are needed to answer the research questions are inherently ephemeral. Faculty and students are unlikely to accurately later recall the extent to which they were able to adapt to changes, the extent to which changes created distress, and how they coped with events. Using the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, faculty and students from a stratified random sample of representative institutions will be recruited to participate in an online survey and semi-structured interviews conducted across three time points. Grounded in the research literatures of crisis communication, organizational science, and disaster management, this project addresses gaps in undergraduate STEM education research related to faculty and student reactions to disruptive contexts, characteristics of institutions that make them resilient toward disruptive contexts, and institutional learning from disruptive contexts. The findings will be disseminated to institutions of higher education and through a public web site relating to the resources most critical for fostering resilience among faculty and staff when adapting to a disrupted educational context. In addition, participating institutions and individuals will receive customized reports and resources. By evaluating the immediate impact of COVID-19, this project aims to enhance the undergraduate education infrastructure, improve the delivery of STEM education during and after disruptions, and help to protect the well-being of faculty and students collectively experiencing this crisis.

We generate information useful to policymakers and local authorities and offer near-real-time state-by-state disease tracking. Our data allow officials to understand where the virus is currently spreading, facilitating improved allocation of resources. We also evaluate the networked nature of the disease, tracking its flow based on the reported social relationships of the survey participants and their social distancing behaviors. The project captures how well the information and communication needs of Americans are met during this crisis, observes patterns of citizen compliance with government recommendations, stay-at-home orders, and enforced lockdowns, and assesses their impact on suppressing the spread of the virus among diverse populations.<br/><br/>The project has two core objectives: (1) producing information that will be immediately useful in improving the national response to COVID-19; and (2) using COVID-19 data to understand how people adapt to and make sense of a national crisis that has important and immediate ramifications for their daily lives. We rely on a large-scale, rolling national survey that is conducted on a daily basis, with approximately 3000 respondents per day. We also link the survey data to the social media behavior of respondents. The large sample sizes collected daily offers near-real-time state-by-state disease tracking, as well as the ability to observe key differences in responses to policies across demographic groups.

461	Sarah Wagner	George Washington University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Funerary Practices, Pandemic Confinement, and the Implications for COVID-19 Transmission	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - In April 2020, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified funerals as high-risk sites for COVID-19 transmission. Funerals are vital to the social health of a community. They allow people to grieve together and remember their deceased, but when the bereaved are not permitted to gather physically, communal mourning becomes more complicated. Therefore, understanding forms of adapted, and accepted, virtual (online) rituals and memorials and their role in preventing infection spread is paramount for addressing future surges of COVID-19 across the United States, as well as for future epidemics. Preliminary research with religious leaders and funeral home directors suggests that social distancing mandates that interrupt funeral, burial, and memorial practices have met with confusion and even resistance. This study will provide key information for the development of public health programs and guidelines that address the risks facing communities that continue to conduct in-person rituals. Given the social importance of funerals and the central role of mourning in the pandemic, communities urgently need to promote practices that preserve the cultural and religious significance of such rites but do not exacerbate viral transmission. The project also provides training for graduate and undergraduate students in methods of rigorous, scientific data collection and analysis.<br/> <br/>The study comes at a time when the rate of COVID-19 infections is at risk of rising exponentially and funeral capacity is being overwhelmed. The investigators thus seek to identify factors that enable or inhibit people?s ability to follow social distancing guidelines that interrupt or run counter to obligations of care for the dead. As research on the Ebola crisis demonstrated, anthropologists? focus on the local perspectives of grieving communities provided crucial insights into the factors that reduced or heightened the risk of infection, and thus played an important role in public health interventions. In collaboration with diverse religious communities, funeral practitioners, and representatives from the National Funeral Directors Association, the study will assess how religious tradition (or lack thereof) influences the adaptation of funeral rites, and how COVID-19-related constraints on funeral care shift the burden of organizing collective mourning onto the family and into virtual spaces. The project incorporates a range of methodological approaches aimed at capturing in real time these adaptive processes, including virtual participant observation (e.g., synchronous religious rites, and funeral and memorial services), initial and follow-up semi-structured interviews, discourse analysis of digital media, and survey instruments. The researchers will pay special attention to variations in access to virtual media. Because rituals reflect the capacity for communities, whether religious or secular, to marshal material and symbolic resources, they illuminate how structural inequalities create disparities across communities and generations. The study thus contributes foundational knowledge to the social analysis of death marked in virtual space, broadening our understanding of the interconnected roles of media, technology, and religion and during times of crisis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

462	P. Timon McPhearson	The New School	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Interdependent social vulnerability of COVID-19 and weather-related hazards in New York City	Engineering - The study will integrate survey, social media, building infrastructure, energy demand and use, and social- demographic data with simulations of potential emerging weather-related extremes to examine interdependent social vulnerability to COVID-19 and weather in New York City (NYC). The research will leverage cutting-edge simulations, modeling, and visualizations of urban social and infrastructure systems to understand how human behavior changes in response to shelter-in-place policies may expose potential interdependent and cascading social vulnerability to COVID and weather extremes. The primary research question is: How will existing vulnerabilities to health, weather, and economic hazards be affected by new guidelines designed to reduce COVID-19 transmission rates in NYC? The primary outcome will be to advance knowledge for understanding COVID-19 impacts in the national epicenter of the virus outbreak and where solutions will be needed for many months as the pandemic begins to interact with weather dynamics and drive interdependent vulnerability over time. <br/><br/>As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves rapidly in NYC, there is an urgent need to collect data on social and economic impacts as they emerge, and join these with existing local, regional, and national datasets to anticipate potential interdependent impacts of COVID-19 as weather dynamics shift over coming months. Social survey and social media data are especially critical to collect now as perspectives on location specific experiences and perspective of green space as critical infrastructure can change over time. Additionally, social media data can only be accessed cost-effectively via Twitter in weekly intervals and analyses are needed now to understand policy impacts in time to plan responses and strategies for resilience to interdependent COVID-weather extremes impacts. A convergent scientific approach is critical for examining how vulnerable populations may be further impacted as spring turns to summer with potential heat waves and extreme rainfall events. The analysis will examine how overlapping vulnerabilities interact with availability and usage of urban green spaces for physical and mental health during COVID-19 shelter-in-place policies. For example, data will include weekly geo-located tweets overlaid with buildings and green space spatial data to explore dominant locations of social media activity in NYC to understand which parks and open space are most used, and which will require additional resources to meet public need for physical and mental health. This data will provide input to real-time decision-making in NYC to impact current emergency responses, planning and policies that consider direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19, weather extremes, and interdependent vulnerabilities. There remains limited systemic understanding of what forms resilience to COVID-19 should take, especially when considering interactions with additional drivers of social vulnerability. Thus, the broader impacts of this research lie primarily in direct engagement with local practitioners?governmental officials, non-governmental organizations, community organizations?to improve their ability to conduct integrative planning and improve real-time decision-making to reduce social vulnerability and plan emergency response in the novel context of ongoing COVID-19 transmission that may be combined with weather-related extremes. Further, research will be provided to current NSF Growing Convergence Research (GCR) collaborators in Atlanta, Phoenix, San Juan (PR), and across the cities in the UREx Sustainability Research Network. (SRN), seeding opportunities to replicate methods and findings. The project PIs will train interdisciplinary graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in this convergent science approach and provide an important mechanism to bring scholars with advanced data science skills to gather important emerging data and advance novel research to understand the potential of interdependent COVID-19 and weather-related impacts on vulnerable populations in NYC.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

463	Alexandrea Ravenelle	University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	RAPID: Work in the Time of COVID-19	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - Gig work, which is often conducted on platforms such as Uber, TaskRabbit, Instacart, Care.com, and Rover, is the epitome of precarious work: the work is so temporary that a 'gig' may last only a few minutes, and workers -- who are usually classified as independent contractors -- are entirely outside the social safety net of workers? compensation, social security contributions, paid leave, or health insurance. Traditionally, low-income workers have fared worse physically, psychologically, and economically in U.S. natural disasters. Also, while white collar and professional workers conduct their work remotely via Zoom, working from the relative safety of their home offices, gig and temporary workers are increasingly being called on to ensure ready access to food, medicine, and toilet paper for their middle and upper middle class work-from-home peers. And the ranks of precarious workers on the frontlines of the pandemic are only expected to grow. This project will examine the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on exacerbating the existing vulnerability of precarious and gig workers. This project will additionally examine how precarious workers in essential jobs are weighing, and addressing, the health risks of working versus the economic repercussions of unemployment, and how the pandemic, and resulting recession, may affect worker views of the desirability of freelance or gig-based work. Findings from the project will help to inform governmental policies at several levels affecting gig workers, as well as labor force participants who may be considering adoption or rejection of gig work in the 21st century. <br/><br/>The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the working conditions of gig workers who, by definition, cannot practice social distancing when completing their tasks. This project, a mixed-methods panel study, will utilize in-depth interviews and surveys with 200 precarious and gig workers in New York City (NYC), the early epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak. Participants will include gig workers who find work via online platforms, freelance workers in creative fields, and fast food and retail workers. The first phase will be conducted between April and June 2020, a period that coincides with the expected peak of the outbreak in NYC, and will examine how workers are coping with these risks, and how the pandemic is shaping their lives and understandings of their work. Follow-up interviews and surveys will be conducted during Fall 2020, concurrent with the expected second outbreak, and will provide an opportunity to study the impact of the Pandemic Unemployment Act and economic stimulus checks on gig workers. Findings from the project will inform sociological theories regarding precarious work, job satisfaction, and job mobility. Findings will also inform theories regarding differential access to the U.S. employment social safety net that appear among gig workers, as well as between them and workers in more conventional jobs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

By taking advantage of significant reductions in atmospheric emissions associated with current COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders, a natural experiment has presented itself that allows for observations to be made under uniquely useful conditions. Results will help constrain predictive models of pollutant concentrations and guide regulatory agencies in best strategies to mitigate poor air quality.<br/><br/>Gaseous and particulate samples will be collected during and after the lifting of COVID-19 by co-locating sampling devices on Caltech?s established roof-top sampling platform, where continuous monitoring of essential parameters, including NOx, O3, and PM2.5, is ongoing. Focus in this study is on the detailed chemical speciation of the important precursor group of compounds denoted as volatile to intermediate volatility organic compounds (I/VOCs) containing 1 to 15 carbon atoms (C1-C15). These compounds are emitted through a number of different sources, including from fossil fuel production and burning, use of chemical products, and biological productivity. Their ill-defined sources and reactivities have been attributed to an existing gap in knowledge that could describe higher-than-expected O3 levels in megacities where precursor emissions have seen a general decrease in past decades. Here, I/VOC sources and source markers will be determined during a period when transportation associated emissions to VOCs and NOx are low. State-of-the-art analyses of collected samples at PIs? laboratories include two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC) with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS) and a multi-column/detector GC system with 5 different types of separation and detection combinations. Results will (i) provide new insight into the intricate mechanisms of O3 and PM2.5 production under uniquely low NOx conditions and a changing mix of VOCs, and (ii) help constrain predictive models of atmospheric chemistry and air quality.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Biological Sciences - Viral infection can induce formation of specific transfer RNA fragments (tRFs) that are packaged and released from host cells in exosomes. The project aims to discover the biological role of exosomal tRFs, specifically investigating whether uptake of these tRFs into uninfected cells triggers an innate antiviral immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory RNA viruses. New insights into the influence of tRFs on host defense mechanisms against viral infections could be exploited to combat COVID-19 and future outbreaks of related viruses. The project also offers training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, the latter through bioinformatics course-based research.<br/><br/>The project is based on preliminary data suggesting that tRF exosomal delivery constitutes a novel mechanism of innate antiviral immunity whereby tRFs prime host cells for a more robust interferon response. The research on SARS-CoV-2 will be guided by specific questions, for example, about the extent of exosomal tRF uptake and bioavailability in recipient cells, whether the tRFs hybridize with viral RNAs and activate interferon production through association with RIG-I, and whether intracellular tRFs inhibit viral replication in cells. Characterization of a novel host defense mechanism could potentially inform strategies for therapeutic intervention against COVID-19. <br/><br/>This RAPID award is jointly funded by the Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

466	Kerrie Douglas	Purdue University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	Collaborative Research: RAPID: Approaches to Online Implementation and Social Support in Undergraduate Engineering Courses	Engineering - The pandemic of COVID-19 is disrupting undergraduate engineering education globally. Students have been asked to move out of their campus residences and back home to take courses online. While some students may quickly adjust and continue to do well in their courses, others may struggle to feel connected to campus and their courses. Recent research has found that peers are a major support for engineering students and supportive social relationships and networks are critical for navigating through engineering education and careers. This research will provide an understanding of how engineering instructors are supporting student connections in their courses and what other social supports students have during this time. <br/><br/>This research explores how choices made by engineering instructors during the COVID-19 pandemic are associated with undergraduate engineering students? academic social capital and achievement of learning outcomes. This work uses a multiple cross-case comparison of three undergraduate engineering courses taught in different ways. Data is collected from three team-based engineering courses at Purdue University: a large first-year course, a medium-sized senior-level capstone course, and a small service-learning course that has first year through senior-level students. Data collection consists of student surveys, interviews with students, faculty, and graduate teaching assistants, course documents such as syllabi and schedules, and student assignment scores. The findings from this study will make online and in-person instruction more inclusive and easier for instructors because it will help make future decisions to ensure that all students have the resources they need to be successful in the course and to persist in their major. Findings and recommendations will be shared with instructors of the courses studied, potentially influencing the learning experiences of more than 3,000 students each year. The research team will use the results of this research to create a list of best practices for online STEM instructors which will be disseminated to the public through social media, professional organization outlets, and archival journals. Ultimately, findings will inform STEM instructors about what they can do to support the success of all undergraduate students by helping them to build academic social capital, whether during online or in-person instruction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Inhibitors that target these enzymes serve as potential therapeutic interventions against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes program in the Chemistry Division is supporting the research of Drs. Mary Jo Ondrechen and Penny J. Beuning from Northeastern University to apply computational methods to identify sites in SARS-CoV-2 proteins that would be good targets for binding inhibitors. The project uses artificial intelligence methods developed at Northeastern University to identify pockets and crevices in the structures of viral proteins that may serve as new targets for the development of antiviral agents. Large datasets of natural and synthetic compounds are computationally searched for molecules that fit into these alternative sites, and any compounds that fit will be experimentally tested for their ability to inhibit the functions of these viral enzymes. The project provides training in computational chemistry and biochemical analysis to graduate students and postdoctoral associates.<br/><br/>This project uses the unique Partial Order Optimum Likelihood (POOL) machine learning (ML) method developed by Dr. Ondrechen?s group to predict multiple types of binding sites in SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including catalytic sites, allosteric sites, and other interaction sites. The goals of this project are to apply the POOL-ML method to identify the binding sites on viral pathogen SARS-CoV-2 proteins using the three-dimensional protein structures as input. Molecular dynamics simulations are used to generate conformations for ensemble docking. Compounds from the large molecular databases are computationally docked into the predicted sites to identify potentially strong binding ligands. Candidate ligands to selected SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including the main protease and 2?-O-ribose RNA methyltransferase, are experimentally tested in vitro for binding affinity and the effect of the best predicted inhibitors on catalytic activities determined by direct biochemical assays. All the SARS-CoV-2 protein structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) are studied. Compound libraries for the study include: a) selected 2600+ compounds from the ZINC and Enamine databases that are already being manufactured; b) a library of 20,000+ compounds found in foods that the team recently gained access to; these potentially hold some special advantages, including ready availability in the public domain and low cost; and c) the March 2020 open access CAS (American Chemical Society) database of 50,000 compounds with known or potential anti-viral activity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

This RAPID project will measure and track agency-level responses to prevent, contain, and respond to the COVID-19 outbreak. Additionally, this project will examine how community corrections (the largest arm of the corrections system) respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and balance public health and public safety. Consequently, this study will investigate the circumstances under which community supervision agencies alter their policies and procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic, while examining the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical and mental health of community supervision officers.<br/><br/>Through surveys and interviews with community supervision administrators and officers, and based on a theory of organization change, this project will take a longitudinal approach to examine how community corrections agencies adapt during the COVID-19 pandemic. These methods will enable a study of the circumstances under which community supervision agencies alter their policies and procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. This project will produce data and research results that will provide key information on the strategies agencies use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings will aid scholarship and agency decision making in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, while informing the development of plans to protect the health and well-being of correctional staff and clients in future infectious disease events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

The investigator will develop colorimetric aptamer-based COVID-19 virus sensors that will change their color or visually indicate the presence of COVID-19 on their sensitive surfaces. COVID-19 aptamers will be synthesized and when bonded with COVID-19 will cause a visible change in the sensor that can be viewed with the naked eye. They will also develop COVID-19 sensors that turn ?red? when COVID-19 is present. The sensor surface is functionalized with the COVID-19 aptamers that is in contact with a buffer solution containing fluorescent microbeads. They are also functionalized with COVID-19 aptamers. The beads do not attach to the sensor surface unless COVID-19 is present to bridge them together. In the presence of COVID-19 the bright red microbeads attach to the sensor surface completely changing its color. <br/><br/><br/>Based on extensive experience with similar sensors designed to detect Zika viruses, biofluids such as stimulant urine does not affect sensor?s performance. Heat inactivated COVID-19 will be used in preliminary experiments. They will be obtained from Zeptometrix corporation and they do not require Bio Safety Level 2 (BSL-2) laboratories for handling. Sensors capable of detecting a single COVID-19 virus will also be developed in this study. Tunneling current sensors (TCS), field-effect transistors using COVID-19 conducting channels, terahertz and UV-VIS spectroscopy, DC conductivity sensors, quartz crystal micro balance and micro-electro-mechanical microbalance will also be developed. Terahertz sensors along with their shorter wavelength optical counterparts have the potential to remotely sense COVID-19 without requiring aptamers. The goal is to have a working COVID-19 handheld sensor in 2 months.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

470	Marinka Zitnik	Harvard University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID:Collaborative Research: Computational Drug Repurposing for COVID-19	Computer and Information Science and Engineering - With the disruptive nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, effective treatments could save the lives of severely ill patients, protect individuals with a high risk of infection, and reduce the time patients spend in hospital beds. However, there are currently no effective treatments for COVID-19. Traditional methodologies take years to develop and test compounds from scratch. Machine learning provides promising new approaches to repurpose drugs that are safe and already approved for other diseases. This project will develop a machine learning toolset to expedite the development of safe and effective medicines for COVID-19. The toolset will rapidly identify safe repurposing opportunities for approved and experimental drugs. It will predict whether treatments may have therapeutic effects in COVID-19 patients, allowing the identification of drugs and drug cocktails that are safe and plentiful enough to treat a substantial number of patients. By putting tools in the hand of practitioners, the activities in this project will have an immediate impact. They will result in actionable predictions that are accurate and interpretable. <br/><br/>Recently, the principal investigators have developed a series of machine learning tools to identify drug repurposing opportunities. Building on foundational previous work, in this project, the principal investigators will first build a large COVID-19 focused knowledge graph that will capture fundamental and COVID-19-specific biological knowledge. The graph learning methods will be adapted to identify safe drugs and drug cocktails for COVID-19. To predict the safety of cocktails with two or more drugs, the methods will generalize to an exponentially large space of high-order drug combinations. In addition to drug safety, efficacy is a crucial endpoint for drug development. The project will develop a novel graph neural network (GNN) method to identify efficacious drug repurposing opportunities, even for diseases, such as COVID-19, that do not yet have any drug treatments and thereby, no label, supervised information. The method will predict what drugs and drug combinations may have a therapeutic effect on COVID-19. Finally, the principal investigators will integrate the developed tools into a complete, explainable framework that will generate predictions, provide explanations, and incorporate human feedback into the machine learning loop. This project will provide new, open tools for rapid drug repurposing that will be relevant for COVID-19 and other emerging pathogens. Additionally, the project will provide unique opportunities for multi-disciplinary curriculum development, training and advising, and professional activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

How should society lessen social distancing while limiting an increase in infections? To answer these questions, this Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project seeks to understand how patterns of interpersonal interaction (?structure?) in social contact networks affect disease spread in a population. The researchers will simulate a disease spreading through a variety of social contact networks, and use machine learning to relate each network?s structure to the number and timing of new infections. By limiting structures related to increased disease, societies may be able to reopen other parts of their economies while still curbing overall disease spread. The researchers will produce an interactive web application for the public and decision-makers to visualize trade-offs between reducing disease and maintaining social cohesion. This research will support the professional development of an early career scientist.<br/><br/>This research aims to determine the inherent risk of SARS-CoV-2 spread based on contact network structure. The researchers will use machine learning to 1) identify network structures that influence disease spread and 2) predict disease spread on empirical contact networks. Important network structures will serve as targets for simulated disease mitigation interventions (e.g. reducing structures that increase levels of disease or increasing structures that reduce disease levels). Finally, the researchers will investigate whether future outbreaks of COVID-19 or other diseases could be alleviated through optimizing social contact networks ahead of time. The outcomes of this research will inform and facilitate quick, efficient interventions to reduce the social and economic costs of COVID-19. This research will develop a general framework for relating disease to network structure. Thus, results can be generalized beyond the current pandemic, serving to further our understanding of potential future waves of COVID-19, as well as other directly-transmitted diseases in humans, livestock, and wildlife.<br/><br/>This RAPID award is made by the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases Program in the Division of Environmental Biology, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

472	Erin Dolan	University of Georgia Research Foundation Inc	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Optimizing distance learning programs to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on REU sites in biology.	Biological Sciences - The COVID-19 pandemic has undermined national capacity to offer onsite Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites. Due to the rapid onset of the pandemic, BIO-REU principal investigators (PIs) were caught largely unprepared to deliver REU learning through distance technologies. This proposal will capitalize of the organizing activities started by BIO-REU PIs to provide distance REU programs. Specifically, PIs are making substantial changes to their programs to engage students in research at a distance, including shifting to research projects that can be conducted at a distance, offering research mentoring and professional development online, and providing informal avenues for communication at a distance. The shift to distance programming is both necessary and unprecedented. Substantive evaluation is needed in order to refine these approaches to maximize student learning and minimize disruption to REU offerings, which play a critical role in developing the research workforce. This project will improve student learning and development in distance BIO-REU sites by carrying out such an evaluation. First, the distance REUs will be evaluated early in their programming through virtual focus groups with students and mentors as well as observations of synchronous, distance activities. The results of these evaluations will be reported rapidly to the BIO-REU PIs to enable prompt adjustments and refinements of distance program activities. Then, additional focus group and survey data will be collected to determine the extent to which distance REUs are able to (a) build a sense of community in their cohorts, (b) ensure student ownership of their research projects, (c) provide quality mentorship at a distance, and (d) influence students? professional growth and their education and career interests. Data will be compared across REU sites and with published studies of in-person REU sites to identify strategies useful for improving student learning in distance REUs. Results will be shared in reports to each REU site in order to make improvements and published for the undergraduate STEM education community to apply lessons learned in future undergraduate research programming. <br/><br/>This project will accomplish two major goals: (1) evaluating distance REUs in order to improve student learning and research workforce development and (2) producing new knowledge about the effectiveness of distance REU programming. Using established approaches and measurements for evaluating undergraduate research experiences, the project will involve conducting focus groups, observing program activities, and collecting survey data from undergraduate researchers and their research mentors at REU sites across the country that are operating at a distance due to COVID19. Results from analysis of focus groups and observations will be rapidly reported to REU site leaders to make immediate improvements to better support student learning. Results from surveys and focus groups will be used to determine the extent to which distance REUs are able to achieve similar goals to in-person REUs, including building a sense of community, ensuring robust student involvement in research, providing quality mentorship at a distance, and influencing students? professional growth and their education and career interests. The project will produce tested strategies for engaging undergraduates in research at a distance, which could be applied to other circumstances such as serving students who are not able to travel to a distant REU site or engaging students following natural disasters. The project will be conducted in the context of biology, which is the domain of STEM with the largest number of undergraduate researchers.

This situation has opened opportunities on underground markets that present dangers to the health and social and financial well-being of citizens. These illicit networks, facilitated by online Tor sites ("dark web"), are notoriously difficult to trace and are a major source of counterfeit products, including counterfeit pharmaceuticals. This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project will collect, archive and analyze data on underground market traffic for pandemic-specific items. A better understanding of the operations of such networks during the pandemic will help inform an effective mitigation response. <br/><br/>This award will support the collection of longitudinal data from darknet markets, forums, and Telegram channels on a broad range of products specific to the pandemic, including personal protective equipment, hand sanitizer and disinfectants, and medications advertised to the general public as treatments for COVID-19 disease. The PIs will collect and analyze data on market participants (sellers), price, volume, demand for these items.

474	Taylor Anderson	George Mason University	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	RAPID: An Ensemble Approach to Combine Predictions from COVID-19 Simulations	Biological Sciences - Decision-makers and the general public rely on models to simulate the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread and predict the number of infections and fatalities. Model predictions are critical to rapidly develop policy interventions that mitigate COVID-19, to anticipate impacts on health care resources, and to strategize how best to impose and lift public health guidelines. Existing COVID-19 models produce radically different predictions, thus creating confusion and mistrust over their use. Therefore, there is an urgent need to compare between the wide-range of existing COVID-19 models and their predictions. The goal of this project is to find a consensus among various model predictions and to make the different model assumptions and uncertainty transparent. An interactive web-based dashboard will serve as an open and accessible tool to inform the public, fellow researchers, and decision-makers where existing models agree and disagree on predictions. The predictions that are agreed upon by existing models can then be used with greater confidence and trust as the basis for effective decision-making to save lives and resources. Apart from the practical importance for the implementation of effective pandemic control measures and public health strategies, other broader impacts are professional development opportunities for early career researchers and training opportunities for a post-doctoral scholar. <br/><br/>To find a consensus among various model predictions, this project will develop a novel ensemble prediction approach that (1) aligns different COVID-19 simulation models and (2) uses a time series clustering technique to unify model predictions. In the model alignment stage, a range of open-source and publicly available COVID-19 simulation models will be selected, aligned based on their parameters, and run as needed. A broad set of predictions will be obtained from the model results, where each prediction represents a possible world with a corresponding number of new cases, fatalities, and other quantities of interest. The time series clustering stage will project possible worlds into a feature space and apply clustering algorithms to find similar possible worlds. For each cluster, a representative possible world will be selected, enriched with measures of uncertainty, and visualized using the dashboard. This project advances the theoretical knowledge base for model alignment approaches and representative uncertain clustering for simulation model predictions. The unification of model predictions into a scientific consensus can be used to inform decision-makers better so that they can develop life-saving interventions.<br/><br/>This RAPID award is made by the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases Program in the Division of Environmental Biology, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

475	Jacqueline Linnes	Purdue University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Collaborative Research: Enabling the Development of COVID-19 Vaccines, Therapeutics and Diagnostics through innovations in Measurement Science	Engineering - This broader impacts of this proposed RAPID proposal is to provide critically enabling measurement science tools to government, industry and academic professionals engaged in mitigating the effects of COVID-19 through work from the NSF Industry-University Cooperative Research Center for Bioanalytic Metrology (CBM). Researchers at Indiana University have developed unique instrumentation to determine the composition of very large particles such as viruses, and they will characterize viruses, vaccine candidates, and antibodies bound to viral particles. Making this unique instrumentation generally available to researchers working on COVID-19 vaccines across the national network of government, industry and academic researchers will quickly address the measurement science problems that will inevitably arise during the race to develop a safe and reproducible vaccine. In parallel, the CBM will address challenges of rapid antibody tests that are not quantitative nor highly sensitive, and typical lab-based methods for determining antibody concentrations are long and cumbersome. Researchers at the University of Notre Dame and Purdue University will develop devices to rapidly quantify the amount of COVID-19 antibodies in patient serum. Such analyses are vital for low-cost examination of antibody levels (and hence immunity) over time. The proposed devices will exploit a combination of innovative antibody capture technology developed at Notre Dame, which provides enhanced signals, and Purdue University?s expertise in the development of point-of-care diagnostic devices. These measurements will be important for investigating the problem of fading immunity and determining if convalescent plasma from a given patient is appropriate for therapeutic studies. <br/><br/>The proposed RAPID research aims to provide fundamental knowledge of the structure of COVID-19 and its elicited antibody response. Analytical and measurement science support of vaccine and biomolecular therapeutic research is notoriously difficult. The molecules in question are often too big and complex for standard characterization methods, and many questions about heterogeneity, stoichiometry and structure cannot easily be answered. Researchers will use advancements in Charge Detection Mass Spectrometry (CDMS) and Ion Mobility Spectrometry (IMS) to study the heterogeneity, stoichiometry, structure and interactions of viral protein assemblies and to provide essential measurements for characterizing newly developed vaccine and therapeutic candidates for COVID-19. The CDMS and IMS tools at the CBM are unique and will allow researchers to directly observe inactivated viruses, 'dummy' viral particles without nucleic acids, bioconjugates containing immunogens on a hapten carrier, oligonucleotides, antibodies complexed to target proteins, and antibodies bound to viral particles. These instruments are starting to revolutionize the analysis of bioconjugations, vaccine development, gene therapies and protein therapeutics. Development of devices for rapidly examining antibody titer will rely on antibody capture in porous membranes that have a long pathlength for sensitive optical detection and a high surface area to volume ratio that enables efficient antibody capture. Device design will exploit expertise in the development of thin strip microfluidic diagnostics. Based on the fluorescence intensity of captured secondary antibodies, these devices will provide a measure of the abundance of different classes of COVID-19 antibodies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

This project focuses on the need for the virus to co-opt a host 3? to 5? RNA helicase to synthesize the negative-strand RNA that serves as template for copying the positive-strand genome. A recent proteomic screen identified a candidate host helicase, DDX10, that interacts with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The research will employ a suite of experimental approaches to characterize this enzyme and two other host RNA helicases also implicated in SARS-CoV-2 genome replication. Detailed knowledge of how host proteins contribute to viral replication will provide new targets for therapeutic intervention, importantly, in ways that help circumvent drug resistance through viral mutation. The project will also support training of a postdoctoral scholar and development of a new undergraduate biophysics course centered on coronavirus-related topics.<br/><br/>Biochemical and biophysical techniques, such as X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM and single molecule spectroscopy, will be applied to determine structure-function properties that govern the helicase mechanism, including polarity, speed, processivity and associated energetics, and how its interactions with the viral NSP7/8 primase influence genome replication. The outcomes are expected to reveal the workings of host proteins during SARS-CoV-2 replication, and thereby open new avenues and novel drug targets to block its proliferation.<br/><br/>This RAPID award is made by the Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

477	Joseph Wartman	University of Washington	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: The COVID-19 Pandemic Seattle, Washington Street View Campaign	Engineering - Seattle, Washington is the first city in the United States to be severely impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Since the outbreak, state and local governments have enacted policies and guidelines (i.e., nonpharmaceutical interventions) to stem the spread of the disease, including a statewide shelter-in-place order. This Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) will conduct longitudinal (repeat) street view surveys for 12 months across a broad cross-section of Seattle to collect data on the community impact of the pandemic. The survey campaign will produce a high-resolution, ground-based record of the urban region both during and after this pandemic. The data set will provide fundamental insights on (1) disaster impacts on business operations, transportation networks, and other community assets, (2) the rate and quality of recovery following shelter-in-place, and how this varies locally based on a community's socioeconomic characteristics, and (3) the impact of shelter-in-place policy relaxation on communities following this disaster. In addition to the data collection, this project will advance the scientific application of post-event mobile imaging by establishing sampling protocols that may be used to guide data collection campaigns for future disruptive events. All project data will be made openly available to research and practice communities in the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Date Depot (https://www.Designsafe-ci.org). <br/><br/>The street view surveys will be conducted using the NSF-supported NHERI RAPID facility's vehicle-mounted mobile imaging system, located at the University of Washington. Two data collection strategies will be adopted: (1) canvassing, an umbrella approach to acquire data that may be used to answer diverse multidisciplinary research questions, and (2) surveying across community capitals transects (social, cultural, built, economic, and public health), an approach grounded in capital-based resilience theory to promote the capacity for replication across a wide range of communities and hazards. The project will also develop and implement a series of open-source routines that automatically process the data to rapidly extract time-sensitive insights from the imagery. The processed data set will serve as a benchmark for calibrating and validating urban simulation and recovery models and many of the emerging artificial intelligence-based models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

478	Tad Dallas	Louisiana State University	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	RAPID: Epidemic control strategies for COVID-19 in age-structured populations: A multi-model approach	Biological Sciences - The recent COVID-19 pandemic has led to the reliance on epidemiological models to forecast the potential benefits associated with various mitigation strategies to control the spread of this novel disease. The mathematical models focused on COVID-19 vary in their complexity from the relatively simple to more elaborate models that follow individuals and their movement over the course of the epidemic. Model performance depends both on model structure and the underlying data available. During the beginning of an epidemic when limited data are available, simple models should work best. As the epidemic progresses, more complex models may then perform better. Yet, most research focuses on a single model and does not consider comparing across multiple models. This research will address immediate societal concerns over the course of the epidemic by using a multi-model approach to ask questions regarding epidemic intensity (for example, the number of expected COVID-19 cases) and the impacts of mitigation strategies on these dynamics. While the research will develop models focused on COVID-19, the models along with the statistical approaches to fit models to data will be applicable for future outbreaks of novel diseases. Additionally, this project provides training opportunities for a graduate student and a post-doctoral researcher. <br/><br/>In general, this research will use a multi-model approach that considers a range of models from relatively simple compartmental models to more complex models that incorporate age- and/or network-structure based on social contacts. The models considered will provide estimates of important epidemiological parameters (for example, R0) along with their associated uncertainty. Understanding this uncertainty and establishing if and when epidemic model complexity is a hindrance or utility for estimating epidemic parameters and epidemic trajectories is a key issue.<br/>This research will combine data with multiple epidemic models on the COVID-19 pandemic to:<br/>1. understand the relative performance of traditional compartmental approaches to network-based age-structured models during the course of an on-going epidemic; <br/>2. quantify the most crucial sources of variation for estimating threshold vaccination criteria, epidemic trajectories, and potential mitigation strategies; and, <br/>3. identify if and when more complex network-based models outperform more traditional approaches as the epidemic progress over time and data availability changes.<br/>To meet the above goals, the analyses conducted will use a Bayesian approach of fitting models to data. A Bayesian approach will allow for the quantification of model and parameter uncertainty as well as assess the uncertainty of forecasted epidemic dynamics and mitigation strategies.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases Program (EEID), Division of Environmental Biology, Directorate of Biological Sciences and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

479	Gil Gallegos	New Mexico Highlands University	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	RAPID: Machine Learning Methods to Understand, Predict and Reduce the Spread of COVID-19 in Small Communities	Mathematical and Physical Sciences - The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has recently reached pandemic status spreading all around the world. The severity of the pandemic, along with an enormous impact on world?s economy and society, has forced governments to introduce emergency measures. It is essential to utilize the available statistical data from trusted sources in order to model and evaluate the dynamics of the pandemic spread, to not only better understand such complex systems, but to learn and develop possible solutions to prevent further spread of current and/or similar future outbreaks. Thus, this research, devoted to the development of mathematical models of COVID-19 pandemic spread, addresses an urgent national need. Faculty and students in computer science, anthropology, and computational chemistry at New Mexico Highlands University have formed a diverse group for finding a solution to the complicated problems of the description and prediction of COVID-19 spread. This multidisciplinary project is expected to yield a better understanding of the interconnections among many factors that contribute to the spread of COVID-19. Statistical data will be collected in regions of Northern New Mexico, including San Juan and McKinley Counties in the Navajo Nation and Los Alamos county outside of the Navajo Nation. Analysis of the collected statistical data along with socio-cultural assessment from this project will be presented to New Mexico (NM) tribal and health authorities. The project will aim to provide a scientific basis for the prediction of disease spread and will consider scenarios associated with the possibility of another wave of the pandemic. Students from this minority-serving institution involved in the project will obtain valuable experience in the application of advanced machine learning models and methods in providing fast robust reaction to a national health, economic, and societal crisis.<br/><br/>In this study, machine learning methods will be used to analyze pandemic spread scenarios in different regions and to glean the most important features of the data characterizing the spread. The research team will use both traditional machine learning techniques and advanced methods, such as artificial neural networks, allowing development of virus incidence model capturing dependencies in both linear and nonlinear domains. The work will concentrate on understanding disease spread with regard to multiple socioeconomic factors. The problem can be treated as a sequence modeling one; so, recurrent neural networks and more complex models based on their recurrent cells might be one promising direction. The next step will be to assemble datasets for small isolated communities with different socioeconomic backgrounds and ethnicities ? comparing Navajo Indians living on the Navajo reservation to Los Alamos County (NM) ? and to test the applicability of the developed model to these regions. The spatiotemporal data available on the spread is heterogeneous in character. An important goal of this research is to classify the collected data with respect to the similarity in the epidemic curve behavior and then build separate models for different regions according to this classification. The proposed model will be used for prediction of future incidents and to produce the most effective non-medical recommendations for suppression and prevention of future viral outbreaks.<br/><br/>This research is supported by the Partnerships for Research and Education in Materials (PREM) program and the Condensed Matter and Materials Theory (CMMT) program in the Division of Materials Research in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Science using supplemental funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Orders during the Covid-19 Outbreak	Engineering - This project will provide an analytical framework to assess potential reduction of infection risks from COVID-19 viral bioaerosols in public spaces, including school buses, classrooms, and retail stores. Viral bioaerosols may cause infection for occupants staying both near and far away from infected people, whether staying indoors at the same time or not. Upper-room germicidal ultraviolet (UR-GUV) light can provide a real-time air disinfection solution with a relatively small energy footprint if its light effectively interacts with the bioaerosol both in the air and on surfaces. This project will develop and disseminate an open-source numerical analytical framework including assessment of UR-GUV disinfection and make it publicly available online to provide a free resource useful for helping to control the spread of airborne COVID-19 infections in public spaces. An effective, real-time, and sustainable engineering solution for air indoor space disinfection is an important precaution to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, particularly in the context of efforts to restart the nation's economy. <br/><br/>The project will develop numerical methods based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to reproduce the processes for viral bioaerosols spread by indoor airflow, removed by exhaust, inactivated by UR-GUV, inhaled by the occupants, and deposited onto surfaces in public spaces of varied spatial scales, ventilation systems, as well as population size and density. This project will also optimize the application of ceiling fans to improve UR-GUV disinfection efficacy. The investigation will provide new insight on infection risk due to viral aerosols and infection control by UR-GUV for surfaces contaminated by viral bioaerosols. In addition, the project will consider two UV-C sources, one by traditional mercury vapor UV-C lamps (UV-C-MV) and another by UV-C-LED for their energy efficiency. The comparison of the two UV-C sources in terms of disinfection, energy efficiencies, and operation cost holds promise for a sustainable UR-GUV solution for minimizing infection risk in public spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

One of the major problems with this outbreak is that emergency rooms, hospitals and ICU wards are overwhelmed with patients. In an effort to find a test for rapidly determining who should be admitted to the hospital and who should be placed in ICU, we have undertaken an international study to find a set of biomarkers that can be used to help Emergency Room doctors to make decisions on whether a patient will become severe. We have established an international team based in China, Vietnam, Spain, Italy, Mozambique, Sudan, Ethiopia, Egypt, Morocco, Cote D' Ivoire and Canada. This team will examine patients peripheral blood for biomarkers that predict the course of disease as mild or severe.

Pardee	Unknown	None	None	2021-06-30	Rapid, Low-cost Diagnostics and Deployable Surge Capacity for COVID-19	The outbreak of the coronavirus, first identified in Wuhan, China, highlights the importance of the capacity for a rapid and nimble response to infectious disease. As we have seen, the world in highly interconnected and outbreaks in one region quickly become global concerns. Diagnostics are a key tool in the fight against spread of the virus, allowing frontline responders to quickly triage patients. Over the past five years, our team has developed low-cost and de-centralized paper-based diagnostics that are simple to use and easy to distribute. During the Zika virus outbreak, we developed diagnostics within weeks and have since completed patient trials in Latin America showing performance equal to the gold standard CDC tests used in clinical labs (sensitivity equal qPCR test, 98.5% accuracy). These diagnostic, programmable by design, thus hold promise for managing future outbreaks. Seeking to contribute to the COVID-19 outbreak response, we have already begun the development of diagnostics for the virus and anticipate having validated tools within a month. Here we propose the following project to create a deployable diagnostic infrastructure for the virus: 1) A lab-in-a-box kit that can provide diagnostic surge capacity for COVID-19 (14,000 tests), 2) A package with the "pop-up capacity" to manufacture the diagnostics on-site for sustained response to the outbreak and 3) A point-of-need test for rapid screening of patients (e.g. cruise ships, airports). Such tools are important in Canada but are especially so in countries where health care systems do not have the resilience to handle a large outbreak. We have assembled a team of researchers from four countries with expertise in virology, diagnostics technologies and delivering impactful research outcomes. Our goal is a diagnostic platform capable of providing the capacity to respond to COVID-19 here in Canada or aboard, and the companion technologies, protocols and training to ensure effective deployment.

495	Dr Sachdev Sidhu	University of Toronto	None	None	2021-06-30	Rapid development of antiviral compounds to fight the COVID-19 outbreak	The outbreak of a respiratory illness (COVID-19) in China at the end of December 2019 has been demonstrated to be caused by a new coronavirus. While health officials are using quarantine methods to try and prevent the spread of the infection, there are currently no treatments for the illness, which can be severe and even lead to death in 2% of cases. Here, we propose to build on our previous research with viruses of the same family, which include those that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). We have previously successfully engineered small proteins capable of blocking the activity of an enzyme of the virus that is crucial for its replication and for shutting down the human immune response. We plan on using a similar strategy to build blockers of the new virus. These will be extremely useful in better understanding the biology of the virus. Most importantly, we will use these blocking proteins to find chemical drug candidates that block the activity of the viral enzyme in infected cells, which can then be developed as therapeutics. Our method is rapid and cost efficient, and within the two years of this grant, we expect to have a number of lead candidate drugs. In order to achieve these goals, we have assembled a team of leading scientists with expertise in protein engineering of viral inhibitors (Sachdev Sidhu, University of Toronto), structural biology of viruses (Brian Mark, University of Manitoba), and development of chemical drugs (Roman Melnyk, SickKids Research Institute, Toronto). Our project also has the support of an internationally recognized leader in viral biology (Marjolein Kikkert, Leiden University, Netherlands) and a frontline clinician-scientist in infectious diseases (Samira Mubareka, Sunnybrook Health Centre, Toronto). Ultimately, this work will generate critical tools to better understand this new virus, and most importantly, will provide novel candidate drugs for direly needed therapies.

496	David N Fisman	University of Toronto	None	None	2021-06-30	Understanding, Forecasting and Communicating Risk During the COVID-19 Epidemic	A new infectious disease, COVID-19, has emerged worldwide. Canada has experienced few cases, but there is great concern about the possibility of a Canadian COVID-19 epidemic. Canada has a history of preparing for and managing disease outbreaks caused by new viruses (SARS, H1N1, preparing for Ebola). For many people inside and outside the public health community, an important part of preparation is having access to accurate, timely, reliable information about how the disease is spread, who is at risk, and who is not at risk. Public health professionals often want the answers to three basic questions about epidemics: "when will it peak?"; "when will it end?"; "how big will it be?". Our team of doctors, epidemiologists, public health professionals, and statisticians has experience responding to past outbreaks like SARS, H1N1 and Ebola. We are already actively involved in analysis and modeling that is helping public health agencies and the general public understand the COVID-19 epidemic, and "see what's around the corner". We have proposed a three-part project, which will use math and statistical modeling to: (i) forecast the near-term course of the epidemic; (ii) gain better understanding of the parts of the epidemic that are hidden from view, by analysing data that are public, but often messy or noisy; and (iii) use our information to build simulations that can help guide Canadian health agencies as they try to control or limit the spread of COVID-19 in Canada. Throughout this project, we will be creating infographics and tools that let Canadians inside and outside the scientific community gain a better understanding of how epidemics spread, who is truly at risk, and what it takes to make epidemics end. By providing timely information to Canadians, we will help reduce the fear, xenophobia and anxiety that are often part and parcel of emerging infectious diseases.

497	Eric B York Kennedy	University (Toronto, Ontario)	None	None	2021-06-30	Understanding Social Perceptions of Risk, Information Sources, Trust, and Public Engagement Related to the COVID-19 Outbreak	The aim of this project is to conduct rigorous research that (a) documents, preserves, and shares perishable data about the social dimensions of an emergent outbreak, and (b) that translates and mobilizes this knowledge into tangible countermeasures that can aid in minimizing the negative impacts of the disease on individuals and communities. With the emergence of a new disease like COVID-19, there is the potential for significant fear, stigmatization, and misinformation. It is essential to understand how these phenomenon operate; to trace how they affect public attitudes, fears, and beliefs; and to support evidence-based communication by government and expert public health sources that can help to minimize panic or stigmatization, support the adoption of appropriate precautions, and promote effective and pro-social responses. We combine four data sources (a nationally-representative survey sampling 300,000 Canadian households three times over the next two years; follow-up interviews with 135-165 participants; social media data; and mainstream media discourse analyses) to investigate a series of research questions surrounding public perceptions, fears, and reactions. The survey and interviews will provide core data on public perceptions of the risk of COVID19, who Canadians are turning to as experts on the topic, and what information they are seeking. We correlate this data with analyses of the content being shared through social and traditional media platforms. This project supports the response to COVID-19. By better understanding Canadian risk perceptions, fears, and information sources, we can support the development and testing of more effective strategies for sharing reliable information and garnering trust. Longitudinal, cross-Canada surveying allows for regional analysis of interventions, rapid identification of what information Canadians are seeking, and the creation of pathways for sharing public knowledge and opportunities for engagement	Canadian Institutes of Health Research	Research Grant	428816.0 CAD

Context and culture are important elements of any public health response, not just in communities, but in clinical settings as well. This project will use a mix of qualitative methods to evaluate how COVID-19 preparedness and response policies are being transmitted and implemented in acute and primary care facilities in the province of Alberta. Through site visits, task analyses, and interviews with public health professionals and clinicians at the provincial level, we will conduct a systematic assessment of how policies, protocols, priorities and communication channels are functioning. We will be asking our participants how they are implementing and prioritizing: staff, case, and space management policies; referral and isolation protocols; and surveillance and risk communication priorities in preparation for the appearance of COVID-19. As well as offering a detailed description of how things are playing out on the ground, our research will identify gaps, challenges, and opportunities for improving existing response efforts. We will be writing reports and papers that help Alberta and other provinces plan for future public health emergencies. These reports and papers will focus on how context and culture impact clinical capabilities for public health preparedness and policy implementation.

While public health policies are required to control an infectious disease outbreak, these policies can adversely affect individuals and communities. Quarantine, limitations in movement and public gathering, and other restrictive measures can put a social and economic burden on individuals, which may be disproportionate, depending on their socioeconomic status and other factors. Healthcare providers are both involved in administering the policy but are also put at grave risk in caring for patients. This will be a multiprovince, multicountry study in Canada (British Columbia, Ontario, Nova Scotia), Bangladesh, and China (Guangdong). We will use qualitative methodology (document review, key informant interviews, focus groups) and quantitative methods (surveys) to examine policy and implementation from the public health/policy perspective as well perspectives of the media, communities, healthcare providers, patients and their caregivers, and members of the general public. These data will be used to improve the process by which public health policies are created and implemented.	Canadian Institutes of Health Research	Research Grant	500000.0 CAD

Infected patients with mild symptoms and asymptomatic contacts need to be isolated, ideally without overwhelming health facilities. WelTel, an integrated virtual care and patient engagement solution, emerged as an innovation initially to support the global HIV pandemic through a Canadian-Kenyan partnership over a decade ago. Co-founded by the lead investigator and registered in British Columbia, WelTel has continued to integrate research into a richly featured virtual care platform that can be used on the frontlines of healthcare delivery. The study aims to: 1-Deploy and co-optimize WelTel to assist in home monitoring and support of COVID-19 cases and contacts; 2- Determine essential linkages and technical demands of the digital health ecosystem for data security purposes and integration into other electronic health records (EHR) & health information management systems (HIMS); 3-Evaluate communication and other metadata captured by the system for public health quality improvement to better understand and reduce barriers (such as stigma); 4-Use novel computing approaches such as natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to harness artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to model, predict, and provide insights into future precision public health approaches. Collaborators have necessary expert skills in quantitative and qualitative research methods for rigorous assessment, and come from the countries targeted for the research deployment (Canada, UK, US, Kenya, and Rwanda). A rapid digital landscape analysis will also be done as a part of this research. Virtual care may be an efficient, cost-effective way to provide the necessary public health monitoring and support for patients and contacts of COVID-19 and future emerging communicable pathogens, as well as can inform public health quality improvement and precision care.

501	David B Nicholas	University of Calgary	None	None	None	Exploring the Psychosocial and Health Service Consequences of Coronavirus on Children and their Families: Lessons Learned for Pediatric Health Care Practice and Policy	Outbreaks such as COVID-19 risk deleteriously affecting the quality of pediatric health care. For vulnerable children (e.g., those with COVID-19 or other respiratory conditions, those who are immunosuppressed, those with a terminal illness), person/family- centred care is essential to their health and well-being particularly in times of systemic challenge, which paradoxically is taxed during a pandemic outbreak. Studies have shown that outbreaks like COVID-19 strain practices such as imposing stringent infectious control procedures as well as widespread stigma and fear. These shifts risk negative impacts on tangible, relational (e.g., communication) and psychosocial aspects of care that can exacerbate patient anxiety and isolation both in and out of hospital. Procedural and other shifts in care may be needed to diminish negative impacts and conversely optimize patient care. Using qualitative data collection, this study will illuminate the perspectives of children, their families, and health care providers about how the COVID-19 outbreak has impacted public health and institutional health care delivery. Pediatric care processes and stakeholder experiences will be explored via ground theory methods. We will recruit pediatric patients with varying conditions, their parents and health care providers. Diversity in family ethno-cultural and socio-economic backgrounds will be sought. Interviews, focus groups and a Delphi consultation will be conducted, as will a comparison of these findings relative to similar data collected by members of this team during the 2003 Canadian SARS outbreak. Accordingly, potential advances in pandemic preparedness and care will be appraised. Recommendations for practice and policy will be offered.

In particular, the effort uses a design thinking approach to (1) examine digital misinformation flows pertaining to the outbreak; (2) develop, test, and improve educational interventions to reduce the spread of online misinformation. The outcomes of the project will be: (1) the creation of effective COVID-19 educational interventions; (2) the provision of health-related information recommendations and resources to guide non-profits and other community groups who wish to educate the public; (3) the development of increased individual and community capacity to identify the differences between trustworthy and untrustworthy information on the virus; and (4) the mitigation of misinformation related to COVID-19. To reach these outcomes, we will rapidly develop and deploy COVID- 19 educational interventions in a variety of cultural contexts. We will test and improve these interventions based on empirical data from a variety of sources including focus groups, surveys, social media, and field research. Instruments, data, and resources will be shared on an interactive website with licenses that allow others to reuse them for free.	Canadian Institutes of Health Research	Research Grant	477683.0 CAD

Although development of vaccines and drugs targeting the virus are ramping up, none of these addresses host response of COVID-19 infections directly. CAVID-19 death is mainly caused by Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which arises from a dysregulated host immune response and associated vascular leakage from viral induced sepsis. Our proposed drug development efforts aim to control the host response and protect patients from ARDS and death. My lab developed a novel zebrafish sepsis model to screen and identify drug compounds that rescue sepsis-associated mortality and vascular leakage. This project will pursue two main research objectives: (1) develop our best anti-sepsis candidate drug UNC0642 for treatment of COVID-19 induced sepsis/ARDS, and (2) carry out drug screens to identify and repurpose existing drugs as anti-COVID-19 therapeutics. UNC0642 inhibits G9a and GLP enzymes responsible for gene regulation. Severe viral infection leads to an immune over-response which drives vascular leakage and results in multiple organ swelling and ARDS. We hypothesize that UNC0642 will protect coronavirus patients from organ swelling and decrease ARDS and mortality by controlling immune-associated gene expression. Dr. Wen has extensive expertise in virology, transgenic animal modelling, clinical medicine and drug development needed to carry out the proposed project. A collaboration with Dr. Samira Mubareka is in place to start COVID-19 virus work at University of Toronto's CL3 lab. Once developed, UNC0642 will become a first line treatment of severe COVID-19 infection. Because of the tragic outbreak of COVID-19 infection in China, regulatory filing for clinical trials in China are likely expedited, especially for repurposing existing drugs. COVID-19 mouse and zebrafish models developed will be rapidly shared with other coronavirus research groups.	Canadian Institutes of Health Research	Research Grant	953819.0 CAD

None	None	2020-03-31	SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Research: Fast track isothermal viral diagnostics	COVID-19 is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). With no treatment or vaccine currently available, it is imperative that rapid, sensitive, and simple screening technologies be developed that can be fully integrated into near real time medical reporting infrastructure so as to speedily identify viral carriers and slow this and future viral outbreaks. The Unrau laboratory at Simon Fraser University has engineered an isothermal RNA detection kit that reports the presence of RNA template by fluorogenic aptamer (RNA Mango) synthesis in a simple fluorogenic assay (Mango NASBA). This technology, which currently is being commercialised for the detection of pathogens in human tissue culture, can be rapidly adapted for the detection of SARS-CoV_2 and offers several advantages over conventional RT-PCR: 1. Isothermal Mango NASBA viral testing has a considerably simpler work flow than RT-PCR requiring only a simple fixed temperature device capable of detecting fluorescent readout. This offers the potential to implement real time viral testing at venues (i.e. airports, borders, hospitals etc) not normally considered with existing RT-PCR methodologies and that require more costly real-time thermocycler infrastructure to implement. 2. We anticipate that Mango NASBA offers a significant time saving of ~3-4 fold relative to a standard RT-PCR assay (90-120 min) in high viral load samples. Should high sensitivity detection be required, Nested Mango NASBA can be performed subsequently. Nested Mango NASBA has sensitivity directly comparable to RT-PCR and can be performed twice as fast as RT-PCR methodologies. We have assembled a team consisting of biochemists, chemists, virologists, engineers, and clinicians offering deep skills in four highly significant fields to help address this rapidly evolving SARS-CoV_2 crisis. This highly expert team will meet the challenge of detecting and tracking this rapidly evolving viral outbreak.	Canadian Institutes of Health Research	Research Grant	516980.0 CAD

As of February 18 2020, nearly 73,500 cases have been identified and 1,875 deaths reported. To prevent further spread and to understand how the COVID-19 virus is spreading, where it came from, and when it likely jumped from animal to humans, the genome sequences of these viruses have been instrumental in providing insights. So far, Canada has reported 8 cases of COVID-19 (5 in BC; 3 in ON). However, no Canadian genomes have been made publicly available. In contrast, over 102 genomes have been released from several other countries including China, Taiwan, Japan, Australia and the United States. Here, the Public Health Laboratory in Alberta, Edmonton and Calgary and the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg have teamed up with genomics, bioinformatics, microbiology and infectious disease experts to address this challenge. We are verifying a direct RNA sequencing method capable of accelerated inexpensive sequencing of COVID-19 virus genomes. We aim to roll out this rapid method into Canada's frontline operations, along with direct analysis to promote global sharing and uptake of needed genome information. The lab methodology and data analysis will be openly available to help the global response in combating this disease.	Canadian Institutes of Health Research	Research Grant	788040.0 CAD

Although coronaviruses generally cause mild respiratory infections in humans, over the past 18 years, three animal-derived coronaviruses have emerged that cause much more severe disease: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the current SARS-CoV-2. Each of these emergent viruses cause substantially higher death rates than common coronavirus infections; the current estimate of the death rate due to COVID-19 syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is ~2.5%. The main challenge in addressing these new coronavirus-associated outbreaks is a lack of suitable therapeutics to treat active disease (i.e., anti-viral drugs) or to prevent disease (i.e., appropriate vaccines). We propose to apply genomics-based tools and drug-screening platforms to rapidly pinpoint new targets for SARS-CoV-2 anti-viral agents and to identify candidate therapeutic compounds. Our team has deep expertise in anti-infective drug discovery, the application of genomics in identifying drug targets, and in the biology and biochemistry of RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. Our project will identify new therapeutic strategies that may help to treat COVID-19 patients. These strategies will also help mitigate newly emergent coronavirus-associated diseases that will undoubtedly continue to cause outbreaks in the future.

Phylogenetic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences improve our understanding of host reservoir species, assess the potential for transmission to humans, and illuminate evolutionary dynamics relative to other viruses in Coronaviridae, informing response to current and future epidemics. We will study the genomic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 to investigate if particular motifs are under selection for increased virulence and immune evasion. We will compare SARS-CoV-2 with genomes of other zoonotic coronaviruses to elucidate common genomic features associated with virulence, host switching, and human-to-human transmission. We will also evaluate spatiotemporal transmission patterns of SARS-CoV-2 across different populations using Bayesian phylogeographic analyses. Such analyses allow identification of spatially and temporally structured, clinical and epidemiological parameters such as the basic reproduction number, period of infectiousness, and true viral prevalence over time within different populations. We will also elucidate the reservoir host species of SARS-CoV-2 in concert with collaborators from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control as well as other Canadian researchers by probing unique environmental samples as well as both novel and existing datasets available for coronaviruses. Phylogenetic co-speciation analysis will explore whether coronaviruses are more likely to jump between phylogenetically proximate host species allowing development of a predictive framework to anticipate future zoonotic events. We will identify genomic factors of SARS-CoV-2 associated with virulence, estimate vital epidemiological parameters, and illuminate potential reservoir species. With the Chinese CDC, we will help focus the response, control and elimination of the current, and future, coronavirus outbreaks.	Canadian Institutes of Health Research	Research Grant	315000.0 CAD

It is no surprise that nurses are questioning the safety of current SARS-CoV-2 infection control routines. These routines also pose extra work in a system where nurses are already working to capacity. If nurses are overworked, then fatigue develops and errors start to occur. Anticipating the demands and required extra personnel for an unknown number of incoming coronavirus patients is difficult. This research team will tackle this problem in two ways. First, we will work with nurses and professionals to refine their infection control routines so as to minimise the workload while simultaneously creating highly reliable safety routines. Secondly, we will develop an approach to creating computer simulations of two emergency departments that allow nurse workload and care delivery times to be precisely quantified. By modelling the care delivery process we are able to see the impact of varying severities of coronavirus outbreaks on the nursing team and, ultimately, how this extra workload affects their ability to deliver the care required to all patients in the unit. This project is a collaboration between researchers at Ryerson University and personnel at the University Health Network. The team will work collaboratively to engage front line personnel in developing the simulation model and co-designing improved infection control routines. The computer models, of two emergency departments with front-line responsibility for coronavirus patient treatment, can be readily adapted to other similar units across Canada. These models provide next-generation decision making support for managers who have to anticipate the unknown impacts of coronavirus, and be prepared to deliver the highest quality of care in ways that are safe for both patients and nurses.

Addressing the spread of COVID-19 misinformation involves identifying the misinformation in circulation, understanding the public impact, and designing and implementing evidence-based solutions to combat the harmful discourse. We propose conducting research into COVID-19 misinformation from multiple angles, developing effective communication and education tools, countering misinformation strategically, and providing policy recommendations to deal with COVID-19 and future outbreaks. Our interdisciplinary team of experts is led by Timothy Caulfield, Canada Research Chair and Health Law Institute Research Director, who has been studying health and science misinformation for over 20 years. Our team will conduct systematic content analyses of traditional and online social media and empirical psychological research on how individuals respond to COVID-19 information. The objective is to assemble and execute a depth-of-analysis sufficient to enact positive outcomes for COVID-19 while establishing a blueprint for future misinformation events. The impact of this course of research will be significant, enabling the development of strategies to combat misinformation, stigma, and fear, to address their underlying drivers, and to improve public awareness, knowledge, and trust. We will meet the call's objectives of contributing to the global response to the COVID-19 outbreak, strengthening the understanding of its public impacts, and providing evidence to inform public health planning, decision making and response.

The African MRC Units have a criticalrole to play in researching the epidemic but also in supporting local health systems in thisresponse. In Uganda, diagnostic capacity is to our knowledge currently limited to theUganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI, Entebbe) and Central Public Health Laboratories(CPHL, Kampala). Given the rapid spread of the virus globally, there is a high risk the first positivecases will be detected in Uganda over the next few weeks.Lessons learnt from other countries suggest that the ability to rapidly diagnose SARS-CoV-2positive samples is critical in controlling the pandemic. However, given the pace of virusspread seen in Asia, Europe and the US, the local diagnostic capacity will need to beincreased substantially to handle the anticipated increase in suspected cases. The Unit haswell-trained laboratory staff, robust procedures and excellent facilities which could supportthe national effort to prevent and contain an outbreak in Uganda.Support Capacity:The Unit intends to prepare for supporting the national diagnostic capacity by offering up to2,500 tests per month over the next 4 months. Full virus genome sequences would begenerated from a subset of positive samples, the resulting data would support theinternational effort in understanding the regional movement of the virus and would monitorfor virus changes that might influence diagnostics or the pathology of the virus.

The current lab testing time for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease COVID-19, could be up to several days. The delays associated with such testing have already contributed to substantial lag times for diagnosis and data acquisition; therefore, urgent action is needed for the development of sensitive, rapid and simple-to-use platforms. The PI is developing one-pot sample-to-answer assay automated process that would detect the SARS coronavirus and yield information and process flows that prove to be generally informative for creating ergonomic point-of-care diagnostic platforms. The modular design of the method preserves rapid assay programmability for navigating constraints such as evolving viral genomes and low resource field deployment. Further translations of this foundational technology will aid detection efforts for other established and emerging pathogens such as Influenza and Dengue viruses. Development of the method involves both graduate and undergraduates students with research, development, marketing and commercialization efforts. Assays are being developed in conjunction with the University of Texas at Austin Freshman Research Initiative where undergraduate students from many backgrounds are involved in cutting edge research from their first days on campus<br/><br/>The Ellington Lab at the University of Texas at Austin and Fabrico Technology Inc. are developing a complete and rapid point-of-care detection system for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The system provides accurate detection of the virus in a test format that can be performed in both clinical and field settings. The SARS-CoV-2 assay uses multiplex loop-mediated isothermal amplification integrated with a sequence-parsing probe system designed using principles of oligonucleotide strand displacement and a Boolean network to compute an accurate positive readout only when all intended viral signatures are identified in a single reaction. The modular design preserves rapid assay programability for navigating both biological and logistical constraints such as evolving viral genomes and low resource field deployment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

526	Anton Nekrutenko	Pennsylvania State Univ University Park	None	2020-04-01	2021-03-31	Rapid: Collaborative Research: Agile and effective responses to emerging pathogen threats through open data and open analytics	Biological Sciences - The same types of questions arise during every emergent viral outbreak regarding its origin, its evolution, the manner of spread, and how to detect and mitigate it. Many, if not all, of these questions depend on rapid and reliable genomic analysis of diverse viral sample sequences by multiple laboratories. Early viral investigation is often impaired lack of reproducibility, rigor, and data/analytic sharing; the current investigation of COVID-19 is no different. Essential questions such as the extent of intra-host genomic variability (indicative of adaptation or multiple infection), viral evolution (selection, recombination), transmission (phylogentic and phylogeographic) cannot be answered reliably if researchers cannot trust/replicate the source data and analytical approaches. The goal of this award is to develop, deploy, and continuously update viral genomic analysis workflows to enable the analysis and monitoring of viral evolution and dynamics for SARS-CoV-2, and to use the lessons learned to prepare capacity for future outbreaks.<br/> <br/>Bioinformatics workflows for critical tasks in investigating COVID-19 and future viral outbreaks will be developed and COVID-19 deep sequencing data will be analyzed and shared openly via Galaxy and Datamonkey to facilitate and accelerate evolutionary discovery and enable the study of and response to inevitable future infectious disease outbreaks. In an age of digital connectivity, open and accessible shared data and analysis platforms have the potential to transform the way biomedical research is done, opening the way to ?global research markets?, where competition arises from deriving understanding rather than access to samples and data. By enabling any researcher with an Internet connection to perform the same analyses as are done by top-flight research groups in resource-rich countries, this award will deliver critical components to resource limited settings, which are often those that are first and disproportionately affected by viral outbreaks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

The context is a large city where the COVID-19 outbreak has happened amid a large-scale collective action. By empirically examining how falsehoods feed and are fed by collective behaviors in this situation, the project aims to understand how misinformation and rumors both online and offline co-evolve during a period of unrest. Understanding rumor diffusion during unrest contributes to identifying challenges for consensus building in contemporary communication ecology. By studying rumor diffusion in a large-scale context, the study adds value in knowing how authorities use misinformation. The project will have impact on training of future practitioners in terms of how to deal with news about unrest. <br/><br/>Research questions concern variation in rumors, misinformation, and the sharing of these; interpolation of COVID-19 rumors into collective action narratives; differences in the patterns of rumors and rumor-debunking messages; and the association between beliefs in misinformation and participation in collective action. Two methodological approaches are taken. First, string-matching techniques are employed to identify rumors and rumor-debunking messages from a large corpus of digital data, crawled from social media platforms. Computational methods including structural topic modeling and diffusion tree network analysis are used to infer coherent themes across rumor messages and to examine rumor diffusion patterns in terms of depth, width, and interlayer ratios. Second, online surveys are conducted in both regions using a stratified sample of about 1,500 anonymous participants. Regression modeling is performed to understand relationships among beliefs in different types of rumors, institutional trust, and protest support.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

528	Patrick Smith	Horizon Research Inc	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Responding to a Global Pandemic--The Role of K-12 Science Teachers	Education and Human Resources - When a global health crisis emerges, students at all levels turn to their science teachers for information and, at times, reassurance, according to researchers at Horizon Research, Inc. (HRI). Science teachers serve a critically important public health function and become an important part of the nation?s response efforts. Given the magnitude of the current COVID-19 crisis, it is likely that students are bringing their questions and concerns to their science teachers. As this award is made, nearly all K?12 school buildings in the U.S. are closed, and science teachers face unprecedented challenges in carrying out the instruction for which they are responsible while simultaneously addressing students? questions about COVID-19. Moreover, they must do this within new instructional formats. Education is crucial for helping students to understand the facts about the virus, despite much conflicting information and misinformation available. Education helps students understand and actively participate in measures to stop the spread of COVID-19. This award will support a national research study on how teachers are helping students respond to COVID-19. The findings will inform the development of curriculum materials for teaching about COVID-19, which are much needed right now, and help science teachers to adapt their instruction as they help to fulfill a critical public health function. This study will enable a better understanding of the role that science teachers can play in a national response, both now and in future crises. <br/><br/>The research will build on a study of science teachers conducted by HRI following the Ebola outbreak of 2014. Specifically, the research will investigate (1) where teachers of science get their information about coronavirus and COVID-19; (2) what types of resources teachers find most useful; (3) what factors influence whether science teachers address COVID-19 in their instruction; and (4) how science teachers adapt their teaching in response to COVID-19. HRI will recruit a nationally representative sample of several thousand K?12 teachers of science and invite them to complete a survey about their instruction related to COVID-19, both before school buildings closed and after. Using the Theory of Planned Behavior, the survey will be constructed to identify factors that predict whether teachers take up the topic. The survey will also collect data about how teachers address the virus and its transmission with their students. HRI will disaggregate survey data by school-, class-, student-, and teacher-level variables to identify patterns in student opportunities. Survey data will be supplemented by interviews with 50 survey respondents to gather more in-depth information related to the constructs of interest. Study findings will be immediately shared through a preliminary report that focuses on the survey data; mainstream print media using press releases; and social media partnering with the National Science Teaching Association. HRI also will publish policy briefs intended as guidance for schools, districts, and states; and research articles.<br/><br/>This RAPID award is made by the DRK-12 program in the Division of Research on Learning, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The Discovery Research PreK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics by preK-12 students and teachers, through the research and development of new innovations and approaches. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for the projects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

The COVID-19 human disaster is further posing significant challenges to mitigating ongoing natural disasters (e.g., drought) in different parts of the world, including the USA. COVID-19 will have a significant impact on multiple agricultural sub-sectors as farm prices will be impacted, supply chains will likely slow down, farm workforce disruptions will occur, and the odds of farm bankruptcies will increase. The reduction of demand for crops and the reduction of supply of labor is likely to reduce revenue and increase costs. Drought conditions will further exacerbate the hardship of the broader agricultural sector as water availability declines due to drought and costs continue to rise.The resilience of agricultural systems in the face of natural hazards (e.g., drought, hot days) has improved over the decades but the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic presents a new and unexpected challenge to the farming community. The combination of drought and COVID-19 can lead to a compounding impact on farming sectors. Droughts reduce crop yield and create financial losses, and COVID-19 further compounds this challenge by impacting farm price, supply chains, health risk, and loss of farm work force. This project will study how the combination of ongoing drought and COVID-19 will affect the agricultural sectors that play an important role in the nation's food security. <br/><br/>The research team will investigate the consequences of compounding drought and COVID 19 on farmers' socio-economic indicators at the county scale, and what strategies can be implemented to minimize the impacts. This project will advance knowledge of the combined influence of human hazard and natural hazard on agricultural sub-sectors and provides an excellent opportunity to study the compounding effect of two different types of hazards in different parts of the USA. Research results will be used to develop strategies for improving awareness about this unique extreme compounding, allowing stakeholders to take precautionary measures for such events in the future. The research findings will be shared with key stakeholders (e.g., Department of Agriculture, agriculture extension specialists) and is targeted to benefit those most affected by this ongoing disaster in the USA and worldwide, assisting in the development of precautionary measures that can be taken in the near future.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (CBET) Division and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

530	Julie Downs	Carnegie-Mellon University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: How uncertainty about risk and conflicting messages affect preventive behaviors against Covid-19	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - The coronavirus outbreak poses a major challenge for our health system. As people become sick and need medical care, they need resources like hospital beds and ventilators. However, if many people become sick in a short period of time, there will not be enough of these resources to care for them all. If we are to treat every sick person with the best possible medical care, we need to both prevent and delay new infections. We know from history and medical science that public behavior is the most important tool for this prevention. But for the public to help, people need to know what to do and how to do it, as well as to understand why these behaviors are so important. People take their cues from those around them in making sense of new, uncertain situations. This makes it important to make sure that everybody is getting good information about the risks of Covid-19 and how to prevent it. Official messages need to reflect scientific knowledge, and myths that pop up in communities need to be addressed so that people can understand and debunk them. The research team has been studying how people are thinking about the risks of Covid-19, and what they are doing to protect themselves and their community. One key finding from that work is that when people are uncertain about the risk, they are more likely to rely on what other people are doing to determine what the right thing to do is. The team also finds that people's main concerns about social distancing are that they are worried about getting by without a paycheck and how they will get food and meet other urgent needs. This project involves surveys and experiments to better understand these concerns and provide new knowledge to help guide policy action. First, we need to know whether helping people understand how to prevent infection will actually lead them to protect themselves. The experiments test and identify how best to help people understand, especially for those who are not fully engaging in social distancing. Then, over the next few months as the situation changes, the research team develops messages to help people understand what is happening and how their behavior can help protect themselves and the people around them.<br/><br/>In early March 2020, the researchers conducted an exploratory survey to determine whether some protective behaviors were reported at low levels and identify predictors of poor compliance. The research showed that compliance with the more extreme social distancing behaviors appear to be dependent on social norms, with rates being lower when other people do not seem to be engaging in such distancing. Furthermore, people appear to rely on those norms particularly when they experience more uncertainty about the risk. The findings also were that concerns about losing pay and disruption of personal plans are most predictive of anticipated failures to comply with orders to stay home, followed by the need to shop for food and other urgent needs. These findings suggest that a policy approach aimed at getting people through financial and logistical hardship is critically important and has the potential to be highly impactful. The new research explores more deeply these concerns and how they relate to protective actions. The first phase establishes which predictive factors have causal influence on protective behaviors. The second phase is an assessment of how well protective behaviors are being performed and identifies causally predictive factors identified in the first phase for a nationally representative sample (oversampling high-risk geographical locations). In the third phase, iteratively for each causal factor, the team develops and pilots messages in a test-bed environment, testing final messages with an experimental design in a national sample (repeating regularly as the environment and pandemic evolve), and following up on a subset of critical messages with a 3-day retest to assess behavior change. Finally, again iteratively for each effective message, the team disseminates recommended messages along with the rationale for why they are useful and how they are understood to work. The team shares its findings with its established network of public health officials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Computer and Information Science and Engineering - The goal of this project is to create a software infrastructure that will help scientists investigate the risk of the spread of COVID-19 and analyze future epidemics in crowded locations using real-time public webcam videos and location based services (LBS) data. It is motivated by the observation that COVID-19 clusters often arise at sites involving high densities of people. Current strategies suggest coarse scale interventions to prevent this, such as cancellation of activities, which incur substantial economic and social costs. More detailed fine scaled analysis of the movement and interaction patterns of people at crowded locations can suggest interventions, such as changes to crowd management procedures and the design of built environments, that yield social distance without being as disruptive to human activities and the economy. The field of pedestrian dynamics provides mathematical models that can generate such detailed insight. However, these models need data on human behavior, which varies significantly with context and culture. This project will leverage novel data streams, such as public webcams and location based services, to inform the pedestrian dynamics model. Relevant data, models, and software will be made available to benefit other researchers working in this domain, subject to privacy restrictions. The project team will also perform outreach to decision makers so that the scientific insights yield actionable policies contributing to public health. The net result will be critical scientific insight that can generate a transformative impact on the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including a possible second wave, so that it protects public health while minimizing adverse effects from the interventions.<br/><br/>We will accomplish the above work through the following methods and innovations. LBS data can identify crowded locations at a scale of tens of meters and help screen for potential risk by analyzing the long range movement of individuals there. Worldwide video streams can yield finer-grained details of social closeness and other behavioral patterns desirable for accurate modeling. On the other hand, the videos may not be available for potentially high risk locations, nor can they directly answer ?what-if? questions. Videos from contexts similar to the one being modeled will be used to calibrate pedestrian dynamics model parameters, such as walking speeds. Then the trajectories of individual pedestrians will be simulated in the target locations to estimate social closeness. An infection transmission model will be applied to these trajectories to yield estimates of infection spread. This will result in a novel methodology to include diverse real time data into pedestrian dynamics models so that they can quickly and accurately capture human movement patterns in new and evolving situations. The cyberinfrastructure will automatically discover real-time video streams on the Internet and analyze them to determine the pedestrian density, movements, and social distances. The pedestrian dynamics model will be reformulated from the current force-based definition to one that uses pedestrian density and individual speed, both of which can be measured effectively through video analysis. The revised model will be used to produce scientific insight to inform policies, such as steps to mitigate localized outbreaks of COVID-19 and for the systematic reopening, potential re-closing, and permanent changes to economic and social activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

534	Catherine Eckel	TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Collaborative Research: The Impact of COVID-19 on Norms, Risk-taking, Information, and Trust	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has hit countries around the world hard and is likely to have both short-run and long-run impacts on health behaviors, social norms, and trust in government and other organizations. In the short run, governments and health organizations provide extensive information and recommend behavior to avoid contracting the disease and spreading it to others. This research involves surveys to figure out whether and to what extent people follow recommendations and change behavior. Because the research team has been following a sample of university students for several years, the team already knows a lot about them, and this facilitates an understanding of variation in compliance with recommendations. For example, risk-tolerance and trust in organizations are likely to matter. The team is exploring how people process information about the virus, and how that affects their beliefs about the risks to themselves and others. The researchers also are examining the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on social norms, and how those change over time. The second wave of the study looks for longer run impacts. The results of this study will be useful in shaping future policies and communications about health risks, especially during epidemics and other health crises.<br/> <br/>The researchers make use of previous samples of subjects to test the impact of COVID-19 information and recommendations on behavior, social norms, trust in each other and institutions, and risk-tolerance. They have four areas of study. The first is how people process ?noisy? information in the context of COVID-19. Prior research by a team member has shown that some individuals tend to misunderstand such information to their benefit. The teams adapt the methodology and protocol of the prior work to examine how individuals interpret COVID-19 information, and how this affects their beliefs about their own vulnerabilities. Second, the team studies the impact of COVID-19 on norms of behavior, including those directly related to the virus (social distancing, hand-washing), as well as norms of trust, sharing and in-group favoritism that may be shifting or newly emerging in response to COVID19. Prior work by a team member developed a methodology for eliciting social norms, and has shown that norms evolve in response to social influence. Third, they explore the impact of COVID-19 on interpersonal trust and trust in institutions, which significantly impacts willingness to follow government and organizational recommendations. Prior work by team members used incentivized games and surveys to study trust and reciprocity in natural disaster settings. Finally, they look at risk perception and risk taking related to COVID-19. Using incentivized measures of risk tolerance, and survey measures of domain-specific risk perceptions and behavior, the team explores the relationship between risk aversion and behavior, but also how the advent of COVID-19 has changed preferences for risk-taking. In these ways prior knowledge about the subjects provides an opportunity to study the impact of a national health catastrophe on information processing, social norms, trust and reciprocity and risk-taking.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

535	Paul Torrens	New York University	None	2020-04-15	2021-03-31	RAPID: Examining public spatial behavior during the COVID-19 outbreak	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the moment-to-moment activities of our daily public lives. Some communities have initiated restrictions on the movement, activities, physical interaction, and socialization of large sections of the population. These actions have been borne of necessity, in a bid to reduce human contact as part of widespread efforts to mitigate the potential spread of the virus. Social distancing measures have taken on a sense of urgency in population-dense metropolitan areas, which host a large portion of the COVID-19 cases. This project will launch a rapid effort to acquire high-resolution data regarding life on streetscapes during the pandemic, with the goal of producing quick-response insight as changes in public spatial behavior unfold. This will be done by capturing and coding immersive, first-person, geolocated video- diaries of metropolitan residents going about their daily streetscape activity, as life shifts to adapt to new social distancing and curfew orders. The data will be disseminated broadly through local community partnerships. Additionally, the project will fund four graduate students in diverse STEM related fields.<br/><br/>This research captures how new forms of spatial behavior emerge, while testing how existing theories of spatial behavior hold under extraordinary circumstances. The central innovation is to focus on individual embodiment in day-to-day streetscape scenes, as revealed in latent and overt spatial behavior through body language in public places. This will be accomplished through first-person video footage of everyday streetscape scenes from a group of recruited volunteers as they go about daily activities during a pandemic. The data will be hand and machine coded to explore patterns of spatial behavior that can indicate relationships between individuals, the built environment, and socio-behavioral phenomena. Emergent relationships will be fine-tuned, using a series of studio-based experiments after the fact, deploying motion capture to methodically and empirically trace-out pathways between non-verbal communication such as gestures and mannerisms, and high-resolution space-time details of spatial behavior, in a controlled setting that utilizes the collected video data as ground truth. To promote broader use of the data and to foster additional research, data will be collated?from both the field and from the studio experiments?using high-resolution space-time Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and virtual geographical environments. These resources will be made publicly available and shared with local partners, with implications for safeguarding public health and wellbeing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

536	Jay Krehbiel	West Virginia University Research Corporation	None	2020-04-15	2021-03-31	RAPID: Collaborative Research: COVID-19, Crises, and Support for the Rule of Law	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - The rule of law is at the foundation of modern liberal democracy. Crises like the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, however, pose a challenge to this long-standing norm that buttresses modern democracies the world over. In the midst of a crisis, individuals' support for the rule of law is tested because their fundamental concern for the health, safety, and welfare of themselves, their families, and their friends is pitted against an abstract belief that the government ?checks all the boxes? before carrying out potentially lifesaving policies. In these situations, one?s desire for decisive government action may overwhelm, and subsequently lead to a decline in, one?s commitment to abstract democratic principles like the rule of law. Consequently, evaluating how crises affect support for fundamental democratic norms is critical for understanding their impact on the health and stability of the liberal democratic order.<br/><br/>This project leverages the COVID-19 outbreak to examine this relationship and determine (a) whether governmental responses to crises affect citizens? support for the rule of law; (b) whether citizens? faith in government efforts is buttressed or undermined in response to elite and expert cues; and (c) whether citizens? attitudes change after a crisis has dissipated. Each of these theoretical aims is tied to one of three unique features of the research design, which relies upon surveys of European democracies. First, to examine the effects of governmental responses, the project will collect survey data on support for the rule of law across four Western democracies in April 2020: Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Second, an original panel survey in Germany will enable the evaluation of changes to individual-level rule of law judgments in the short, medium, and long term. Lastly, embedded survey experiments will provide causal evidence on how elite and expert cues affect both the acceptance of policies and support for key aspects of the rule of law, such as compliance with laws and support for judicial constraints on executive and legislative power.

537	Mark Graham	YALE UNIVERSITY	None	2020-05-01	2022-04-30	RAPID: Instructional Shifts in Response to COVID-19 and Their Impacts on Classroom-based Undergraduate Research Experiences	Education and Human Resources - Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) greatly expand opportunities for students to participate in authentic research early in their academic career. Research participation is linked to increased student persistence in STEM, especially for students from groups that are underrepresented in STEM. Thus, by increasing the number and diversity of students who have a research experience, CURES also broaden participation in STEM careers. CURES typically engage student teams in hands-on work in laboratories or field sites. With the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, the national CURE education landscape quickly and dramatically changed to a fully ?online? mode, with limited opportunity for advance planning. Thus, this situation presents a unique and urgent opportunity to explore how CUREs evolve in a new online environment, as well as whether they continue to achieve core CURE educational goals. It also allows for assessment of whether these rapid course changes have equitable outcomes for all students, including first-generation students, students on financial aid, and from different socioeconomic backgrounds. If CUREs are a solution for engaging large numbers of early-stage undergraduates in authentic STEM research, then the feasibility to translate CUREs online must be known. It is important to understand the structure of these newly online CUREs, in what situation they are effective, and who they benefit. The results of this project have the potential to expand understanding of CURE instructional approaches and outcomes, for both practitioners and researchers. Additionally, this unexpected shift to online coursework is an opportunity to engage broader higher education audiences in new thinking about course configuration, online effectiveness, and supports and barriers for online teaching.<br/><br/>The purpose of this project is twofold: 1) capture and analyze how CURE course activities are rapidly translated into online formats; and 2) assess effects of course changes on students with different demographic profiles. It will provide early evidence to answer if, how, and why CURE benefits are realized through the different modality of online teaching. Importantly, this project will not make conclusions about the quality of online CUREs or online teaching overall; instead, it will explore which CURE activities can be readily delivered online, how they get delivered, how students respond, and how this new way of teaching changes/expands how instructors think about CUREs. The present project will use a mixed-methods design to track online implementation of CURE courses in two samples. The first sample will include a diverse set of local CUREs that span multiple STEM departments and have an array of course objectives/structures. This collection of CUREs will afford an in-depth, qualitative case study investigation that will capture and analyze instructors? thinking, plans, and products, before, during, and after the shift from hands-on, laboratory-based CUREs to ones that are now abruptly online. The second sample will include CURE courses from a national network, which will allow us to explore more broadly and in a more quantitative way, how a large number of instructors transitioned to online. The project will also examine the resulting emotions, motivations, and experiences of students during this transition and how this semester?s student outcomes compare to those from prior years, through analysis of a historical student outcomes database. This approach will provide broad reach and comparison among a relatively homogenous set of CUREs, since all CURE instructors in this network are trained in the same research approach, have similar course objectives, and use similar materials.

538	Amanda Driscoll	Florida State University	None	2020-04-15	2021-03-31	RAPID: Collaborative Research: COVID-19, Crises, and Support for the Rule of Law	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - The rule of law is at the foundation of modern liberal democracy. Crises like the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, however, pose a challenge to this long-standing norm that buttresses modern democracies the world over. In the midst of a crisis, a person?s support for the rule of law is tested as their fundamental concern for the health, safety, and welfare of themselves, their families, and their friends is pitted against an abstract belief that the government ?check all the boxes? before carrying out potentially lifesaving policies. In these situations, one?s desire for decisive government action may overwhelm, and subsequently lead to a decline in, one?s commitment to abstract democratic principles like the rule of law. Consequently, evaluating how crises affect support for fundamental democratic norms is critical for understanding their impact on the health and stability of the liberal democratic order.<br/><br/>This project leverages the COVID-19 outbreak to examine this relationship and determine (a) whether governmental responses to crises affect citizens? support for the rule of law; (b) whether citizens? faith in government efforts is buttressed or undermined in response to elite and expert cues; and (c) whether citizens? attitudes change after a crisis has dissipated. Each of these theoretical aims is tied to one of three unique features of the research design, which relies upon surveys of European democracies. First, to examine the effects of governmental responses, the project will make collect survey data on support for the rule of law across four Western democracies in April 2020: Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Second, an original panel survey in Germany will enable the evaluation of changes to individual-level rule of law judgments in the short, medium, and long term. Lastly, embedded survey experiments will provide causal evidence on how elite and expert cues affect both the acceptance of policies and support for key aspects of the rule of law like compliance with laws and support for judicial constraints on executive and legislative power. Findings from each part of the project will provide insights into the individual-level dynamics crises activate in citizens? relationship with democratic principles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

539	Alex Perkins	University of Notre Dame	None	2020-04-15	2021-03-31	RAPID: Real-time updating of an agent-based model to inform COVID-19 mitigation strategies.	Biological Sciences - The SARS-CoV-2 virus is responsible for the most significant pandemic in a century. With a vaccine not yet available, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) offer the only way to control the virus at this time. Those interventions, which include social distancing, school closures, and sheltering in place, may be effective if timed appropriately and adopted widely. At the same time, NPIs cause serious social and economic disruption, meaning that they must be used as sparingly as possible. To inform decisions about when to adopt NPIs, and when to relax them, it is important to understand what the consequences of those actions might be. This research will advance the capability of mathematical models to provide insight into those consequences. Looking to past data, the researchers will use statistical approaches to estimate key unknowns, such as numbers of people previously or actively infected. Looking into the future, the researchers will use simulation modeling of communities across the United States to evaluate the consequences of alternative actions. Merging these approaches will capitalize on the strengths of each, resulting in improved projections of the consequences of alternative strategies for mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.<br/><br/>This project will feature a geographically realistic, agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the United States. Advantages of this model include its detailed portrayal of the density, demography, and movement patterns of people in specific counties across the United States, and its ability to directly implement NPIs through behavior modification of agents. These features enable locally tailored projections of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and impacts of NPIs thereon. At the same time, the computational demands of agent-based models pose a challenge to using them in the fast-paced context of a pandemic. To overcome that challenge, the researchers will use less computationally demanding statistical approaches to estimate inputs for use in the agent-based model up to a given point in the pandemic. The agent-based model will then simulate forward from that time under alternative scenarios about use of NPIs. To further safeguard against computational demands being a limiting factor for producing timely results, the researchers will make use of high-performance computing resources to perform batches of simulations of the agent-based model that account for stochasticity and parameter uncertainty. Results will be publicly disseminated on a regular basis over the course of the project, and the researchers will coordinate with stakeholders to ensure that mitigation scenarios under consideration remain relevant as the pandemic progresses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

540	Manish Kumar	University of Texas at Austin	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Accessible Surfaces for Interrupting Sustained Coronavirus Transmission (ASsIST)	Engineering - The global COVID-19 pandemic causing considerable human health and economic impacts presents the research community with a unique set of urgent challenges that need to be addressed. One of the challenges is to slow the transmission of SARS-CoV2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The goal of this project is to design simple techniques to make protective materials that prevent virus transmission. To achieve this goal, virus particles will be designed to make virus research easier and safer. Materials that will be tested will be coated with readily available plant proteins to prevent virus transmission. These materials will include those used for masks, air conditioning filters, and work surfaces. The plant proteins are also easy to attach to surfaces such as cotton and other natural and synthetic fibers by simply immersing these materials in protein solutions. Models of COVID-19 will be created in two different methods: (1) a virus that normally infects bacteria will be modified to produce the ?spike? of SARS-CoV2 on its surface; (2)The spike protein will be inserted into synthetic lipid membrane droplets similar to those coating SARS-CoV2. These two non-pathogenic model viruses will allow widespread research into coronavirus and other emerging viruses without the need for highly protective specialized equipment. Successful completion of this research will inform efforts to protect the public and potentially lead to new effective nature-based protective measures against the spread of SARS-CoV2 and other similarly structured viruses.<br/><br/>SARS-CoV2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19) is a lipid enveloped virus with protruding spike proteins. The structure of the spike protein was recently determined by researchers at the University of Texas. The goal of this proposed research is to evaluate the ability of surfaces functionalized with specific plant-derived antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to bind this spike protein. These AMPs include two proteins obtained from aqueous extracts of the Moringa oleifera seed (MO): a chitin binding protein (MoCBP) and a cationic protein (MO2.1). The central hypotheses of the proposed work are: (i) specific binding of the SARS-CoV2 spike protein receptor binding domain using MoCBP-functionalized surfaces can be used as an effective removal technique, and (ii) MO2.1 on functionalized surfaces will inactivate SARS-CoV2 by damaging the lipid envelope of the virus. Recent simulation and experimental results demonstrate strong interactions of MoCBP with the purified spike protein from SARS-CoV2. To facilitate this research, we will develop a non-pathogenic model of SARS-CoV2 for rapid experimentation without the need for specialized safety equipment. The following tasks will be performed to test hypotheses and achieve the goal of this research: 1) test virus removal efficiency of MO-coated cotton from water and air by using filtration experiments with SARS-CoV2 spike protein and modified T7 bacteriophages displaying the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV2 as surrogates; 2) test the interaction of MO2.1 with the lipid membrane of SARS-CoV2 by using virus-like lipid particles amended with spike protein as virus surrogates to establish removal/inactivation; and 3) test the effectiveness of easily accessible surgical masks and HVAC filters coated with MO proteins in immobilizing SARS-CoV2. Successful completion of this research has great potential to lead to the development of effective technology for removal and protection against SARS-CoV2.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

541	Qi Wang	Northeastern University	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	RAPID/Collaborative Research: High-Frequency Data Collection for Human Mobility Prediction during COVID-19	Engineering - COVID-19 has and is continuing to dramatically alter the lives of millions of Americans as businesses, schools, and many public places have closed around the country. Recommendations of public officials along with individual concerns and fears have fundamentally changed the pattern of daily routines as Americans have adopted the practices of social distancing, sheltering in place, and even self-quarantine. This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project will improve our ability to assess and predict changes in mobility patterns under sudden disruptions caused by large-scale public health crises such as COVID-19. The specific focus will be to understand changes in mobility patterns and the complex and dynamic decision-making process shaping these changes during the unfolding events associated with this major public health crisis. The project will advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by greatly improving the preparedness and responses of public agencies facing COVID-19 and future similar public health crises. It will also help understand and predict reduction, change, and recovery of human mobility patterns promoting the progress of science in human mobility and urban resilience, in alignment with the mission of NSF.<br/><br/>The objectives of this RAPID project are to: (1) capture and ultimately predict spatiotemporal changes in the patterns of human mobility in response to the COVID-19 pandemic using social media data mining techniques; (2) perform high-frequency individual-level surveys via a smartphone app to understand motivational, decisional, and sentimental factors shaping changes in mobility patterns; and (3) explore conversion and convergence functions for high fidelity and high accuracy human mobility prediction. The intellectual merits of this research include: the discovery of unique mobility patterns emerging from this public health crises related to social distancing, sheltering, and self-quarantine practices; the unprecedented gathering of longitudinal evidence about the motivational, decisional and sentimental factors shaping mobility decisions; and the development of innovative algorithms of using a small representative sample for high-fidelity mobility prediction. The data and knowledge gained from the project will enhance future studies on urban mobility, travel demand and resource allocation modeling, and help policymakers assess the response and recovery of major urban metropolitan area facing a devastating disaster such as COVID-19. Project outcomes will be disseminated through the Boston Area Research Initiative (BARI), an inter-university partnership between Northeastern University and Harvard University, and through the MetroLab Network.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

542	Jonathan Marchant	Medical College of Wisconsin	None	2020-06-01	2021-05-31	RAPID: How do vertebrate endolysosomal Ca2+ channels control coronaviral tropism?	Biological Sciences - This research advances the national prosperity and the bioeconomy and enhances our understanding of the mechanisms that allow the spread of corona viruses between species. Results of this research may be the basis for identifying biomarkers of severity of disease or spread of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 or COVID). This project will produce an understanding of why some coronavirus strains that normally infect specific animals (such as birds and bats) sometimes also infect humans, whereas other strains do not. This knowledge is critical for understanding how viruses break species barriers to colonize new hosts and precipitate widespread infections, as experienced during the ongoing COVID pandemic. Coronaviruses infect cells by binding to specific cell surface receptors and passing through organelles known as endosomes and lysosomes to access the cell interior. This project will investigate how the environment within these cellular structures regulates the intensity of viral infection. Through the use of comparative biology across different vertebrate species, the goal will be to identify conditions in endosomes and lysosomes that facilitate infection in particular organisms. This research may be the basis for identifying biomarkers of severity of disease or COVID spread. This research will also provide tools to enable a broad research community working on COVID and other viruses. This proposal also uses funding to train graduate and undergraduate students. As such this funding is training the next generation of leaders in science. Results expected from this work will facilitate identification and control of COVID spread in humans and other animals. <br/><br/>The coronoaviridae (CoVs) are a family of single-stranded RNA viruses that infect three vertebrate groups: mammals, birds and fish. Understanding the molecular determinants underpinning this tropism, namely why CoVs naturally and efficiently infect these species, and target specific tissues within these animals, is a fundamental biological concept. Definition of the mechanisms restricting CoV tropism is therefore critical for our understanding of how CoVs break species barriers and colonize new hosts. In this RAPID proposal, the role of the luminal microenvironment of the endolysosomal system in determining the efficiency of CoV infection will be studied for different CoVs in different vertebrate species. The central hypothesis is that the cellular proteins called ion channels resident in endosomes and lysosomes are differentially present in lower mammals and humans. Furthermore, these ion channels uniquely create environments within endosomes and lysosomes in lower mammals that are critical for supporting coronaviral infection and the differential expression of endolysosomal ion channels between tissues and species regulates the effectiveness of CoV infection. This hypothesis will be tested using a variety of cell models, imaging approaches and infection assays.

In contrast to other viruses such as influenza, SARS, and MERS, COVID-19 differs in a number of ways, including uncertainties in response to weather conditions, history of the disease, as well as the effectiveness of responses from public health officials or from the general public. An important aspect is to integrate multi-source data such as official reports, atmospheric variables, and social media data into operational biosurveillance and real-time prediction of COVID-19. The proposed biosurveillance framework will be used to forecast COVID-19 dynamics and to enhance mitigation strategies. In addition, it could also be applicable to tracking many other infectious diseases, thereby contributing to security of our society as a whole. Furthermore, the project will build innovative connections within and across mathematical biology, statistics, and deep learning, with a strong focus on interdisciplinary graduate research training.<br/><br/>As the main forecasting framework, the widely used Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) dynamic models can accurately describe the disease dynamics, but only with precise knowledge of disease parameters, which can take a long time to accurately estimate. Deep learning algorithms can potentially have superior predictive ability, but they require extensive training. Another key challenge in the statistical modeling of these events is how to timely and systematically integrate multiple sources of surveillance, anecdotal, and other health-related information under uncertainty. The proposed new predictive approach is based on the interaction between multiple data sources, dynamical SEIR models, and deep learning algorithms. The key idea is to view simulation SEIR models as ?surrogate? pre-trainers for the deep learning models, resulting in less real data needed to retrain the predictive model to reflect ?real world? COVID-19 progression. Deep learning predictive models can then be used for making predictions about the future COVID-19 dynamics, which can be compared to the predictions made by the original SEIR model. Depending on which mathematical model makes better predictions, another model can be updated with the better prediction as inputs, thereby representing reinforcement learning from both data and the best mathematical model. As a result, the new predictive framework will allow one to assess impacts of the immediate responses such as declaration of a national emergency, a school closing, or a quarantine, and can be considered as a step toward interpretable AI for COVID-19 biosurveillance.<br/><br/>This grant is being awarded using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Real-time location traces of individuals can be used to significantly speed up and scale up contact tracing. However, such use also heightens concerns on individual privacy and data abuse. Urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic requires a careful balance of privacy protection with public health benefits. This project aims to develop techniques and a mobile application, REACT, for REAal-time Contact Tracing and risk monitoring via privacy-enhanced tracking of users' locations and symptoms. To enhance privacy, users can control and refine the frequency and granularity with which their information will be collected and used. REACT will enable: 1) contact tracing of individuals and locations that a confirmed case has contact with for quarantine and decontamination to control further spread, 2) individual risk monitoring based on the locations they visit and their contact with others so they can be informed and alerted; and 3) community risk monitoring and detection of early signals of community spread to prepare for larger-scale infections. <br/><br/>The project will develop and study: 1) efficient and scalable data structures and algorithms for contact tracing queries given a large number of users and multi-resolution location traces; 2) a learning-based approach for modeling users? risks in real time; 3) a social network sensors approach for monitoring the community risk, and 4) a multi-stage privacy approach where users can upload generalized locations to receive alerts and more precise locations when they are notified as possible contacts with confirmed cases for refinement and confirmation. More rigorous privacy enhancements will be studied including location perturbation based on geo-indistinguishability and its variants and searchable encryption for contact tracing on encrypted locations. In addition, the project includes a set of dissemination and education activities: 1) releasing a mobile app with open-source system components; 2) investigating privacy-preserving mechanisms to share the collected data for research studies; and 3) integrating the research in classes and organizing seminar series and tutorials to promote the interdisciplinary research area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

546	John Jonides	University of Michigan Ann Arbor	None	2020-04-01	2021-03-31	RAPID: Factors that affect understanding the risks of COVID-19	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - The threat of the COVID-19 virus has not been clearly understood by a substantial portion of the U.S. population. Many people have been slow to adopt attitudes and behaviors that will serve to mitigate the risks of the pandemic. With all the publicity that the virus has engendered, how can this be so? The researchers hypothesize that these failures to change attitude and behavior stem from three factors: failures to realize the impact that this disease has, failures to realize how quickly it will be transmitted, and failures to appreciate the dire consequences it will have on the health care system. In this study, the researcher will examine factors underlying these failures and ways to improve delivery of information relevant to COVID-19. Results and suggestions for improving communication and comprehension are expected to be disseminated widely and expeditiously.<br/><br/>In order to investigate ways of improving the understanding of the risks involving COVID-19, the researchers, a highly experienced and inter-disciplinary team, propose three lines of research. They will examine (a) how different ways of presenting information about the proliferation of the disease affects people?s estimates of its incidence and rates of death, as well as intended future social behavior, (b) how individual differences among individuals and countries along demographic and trait dimensions will influence their estimates of the spread of the disease, and (c) how people are reasoning about the impact of the disease on the viability of the healthcare system. Methods will include measuring the ability to predict risk and consequences of the disease as well as the impact of ?flattening the curve? as functions of several variables, including mode of information presentation, numeracy, motivation, health status, and other demographic and trait variables.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

547	Judy Diamond	University of Nebraska-Lincoln	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Using Popular Media to Educate Youth About the Biology of Viruses and the Current COVID-19 Pandemic	Education and Human Resources - As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program funds innovative research, approaches, and resources for use in a variety of settings. <br/><br/>This RAPID was submitted in response to the NSF Dear Colleague letter related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This award is made by the AISL program in the Division of Research on Learning, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The project will develop and research an integrated package of high-quality, widely accessible media and other outreach materials designed to engage middle school youth, educators, and libraries in learning about viruses in relation to COVID-19. There is an immediate need to provide youth with accurate, engaging, and accessible materials to help them understand the basic biology underlying the COVID-19 pandemic, including the routes of COVID-19 transmission and mechanisms to prevent its spread. This is particularly important for those without science backgrounds or interests so that the rumors, hearsay, and gossip circulating among youth can be replaced with research-based information. Since 2007, the project team and partners have focused on developing and studying new ways of educating youth and the public about biology, virology, and infectious disease. The project will develop a web-accessible package of customizable graphics, illustrated stories, and essays?all of which can be easily incorporated into free-choice and directed on-line learning as well standards-based lesson plans for Grades 6-8. These resources will be disseminated broadly and at no cost to youth and educators of all kinds, including schools, libraries, museums, and other established networks for formal and informal science education. The project web package will be linked to multiple websites that serve as important educational resources on science and virology for youth, the general public, and educators. A prominent university press will publish and promote the illustrated stories and support distribution of 7,000 free copies. <br/><br/>The project will conduct research examining how richly-illustrated science narratives impact youth understanding of and curiosity about science. The research will help develop the foundation for better understanding how to educate youth about COVID-19 (and future pandemics) while generating new knowledge about effective methods for public science outreach during a major unanticipated natural event. For formative evaluation, the project will use an innovative rapid response feedback method. Youth will be invited to provide timely, specific comments on the serialized stories through a curated portal. As new excerpts are related online, different questions will be posed to youth who are selected because of specific characteristics (e.g., low or high initial science interest). These data will guide story development in real time and provide a mechanism to gauge the story appeal, comprehensibility, and initial impacts. The project will address two research questions: ?How effective are illustrated stories in having positive impacts among participants on COVID-19 knowledge, science identity, attitudes, and interest in science careers?? and ?How do story lines and characters have differential impacts on virus knowledge, epidemiology, and youth attitudes towards science and science careers?? To conduct this research, the project will conduct online surveys using adapted items from prior research conducted by the project team. Additional items will assess COVID-19 knowledge, attitudes, personal experiences with the virus, well-being, and exposure to public health messaging about the virus. Research findings will be shared widely to inform the field about new ways delivering science education content during the advent of rapidly evolving global and educational challenges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

548	David Schaefer	University of California-Irvine	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Social Network Consequences for Underrepresented STEM Students as a University Transitions to Remote Activities	Education and Human Resources - The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted universities worldwide to abruptly shift to remote learning. This coincides with a critical social change as students are urged to leave campus, ?social distance,? and shelter-in-place; practices that will disrupt social network functioning and could lead to feelings of isolation, reduced motivation, and poorer learning outcomes. Worse, the social and academic consequences could be more severe for less academically prepared students (e.g., underrepresented minorities, first-generation college, low socioeconomic status) and first year students in particular, who are still adjusting to college life (e.g., building social networks, learning university culture). Given the uncertainty of the current situation, it is critical to understand how the pandemic and the "social distance" triggered by it may influence student social networks and whether disparities in social and academic outcomes result. This RAPID was submitted in response to the NSF Dear Colleague letter related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This award is made by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program in the Division of Research on Learning, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. <br/><br/>The goal of this RAPID research project is to investigate how the shift to remote learning triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting social networks, psycho-social adjustment, and academic outcomes for first-year STEM majors, and whether disparities emerge for students from subgroups historically more likely to leave STEM. The research will examine these potential impacts, and how risks might be offset by an existing intervention at the University of California Irvine (UCI) -- the Enhanced Academic Success Experience (EASE) program. EASE is a learning community designed to improve academic outcomes for under-prepared students, with one-third of the approximately 1,000 first-year majors in the School of Biological Sciences (Bio Sci) participating each year. To date, research on the intervention has provided strong causal evidence that EASE has successfully increased motivation, engagement, and belongingness, with stronger effects for groups typically underrepresented within STEM. As part of the intervention, researchers have gathered longitudinal network data that are unique in both scale (~1,000 students/year within a major) and coverage (85-96% response rate). This research will characterize changes in friendship and study networks, psycho-social adjustment, and academic outcomes that result from the unprecedented shift to remote organizational activities. The new data collection and analysis will explore whether the shift to remote learning creates disparities in these important outcomes for subgroups of STEM students and whether the learning community provided by EASE may mitigate these effects. Through supplementary data collection, the study will consider how student networks have adapted to the organizational shift to remote learning and where students are obtaining the kinds of emotional and instrumental support they need. Mediation analysis will offer insight into which network characteristics explain psycho-social and academic consequences of the shift to remote learning. More generally, the unique data will enable assessment of how social networks adapt to societal-level disruption caused by the pandemic, and how well-implemented institutional support may offset the anticipated risks associated with the pandemic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Daily Well-Being, Social Experiences, and Academic Persistence in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - Rapid societal shifts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have necessitated that education move online. Such shifts also increase students? exposure to online discrimination, which can in turn negatively impact students? academic performance and development. Prior research suggests that discrimination can push students away from pursuing STEM careers at a moment when a diverse, interdisciplinary STEM workforce is critical to confronting complex scientific challenges. In traditional in-person educational settings, positive interactions with diverse classmates and instructors can facilitate the maintenance of cognitive performance, educational attainment, and STEM participation despite negative experiences. Whether these positive interactions transfer to an online context, and whether they similarly buffer the effects of discrimination, is less understood. This study captures important daily variations in students? well-being and academic outcomes that can inform future university practices regarding education and student wellness during crises. The findings may be of particular interest to educational institutions that have been forced to quickly shift to online instruction. As the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates, there is a need for novel ideas and excellent leadership in STEM fields. This study will identify factors that may protect and promote STEM career outcomes.<br/><br/>This project capitalizes on an existing ethnically diverse sample of college STEM majors who previously (pre-pandemic) reported on their daily in-class experiences, well-being, and academic outcomes. The present study collects additional data, using nearly identical methods, across two 7-day cycles. The project aims to: (1) Describe the frequency of daily discrimination experienced by college-aged ethnically diverse STEM majors; (2) Assess the extent to which rates of discrimination differ from their pre-pandemic levels; (3) Examine whether daily discrimination is correlated with STEM students? day-to-day well-being, academic efficacy, and outcome expectations for their future STEM careers; and (4) Explore digital peer and university social supports as moderators of associations between daily discrimination and outcomes in a context of limited in-person interaction. Exploratory open-ended questions will identify participants? educational experiences related to COVID-19.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

It is motivated by the observation that COVID-19 clusters often arise at sites involving high densities of people. Current strategies suggest coarse scale interventions to prevent this, such as cancellation of activities, which incur substantial economic and social costs. More detailed fine scaled analysis of the movement and interaction patterns of people at crowded locations can suggest interventions, such as changes to crowd management procedures and the design of built environments, that yield social distance without being as disruptive to human activities and the economy. The field of pedestrian dynamics provides mathematical models that can generate such detailed insight. However, these models need data on human behavior, which varies significantly with context and culture. This project will leverage novel data streams, such as public webcams and location based services, to inform the pedestrian dynamics model. Relevant data, models, and software will be made available to benefit other researchers working in this domain, subject to privacy restrictions. The project team will also perform outreach to decision makers so that the scientific insights yield actionable policies contributing to public health. The net result will be critical scientific insight that can generate a transformative impact on the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including a possible second wave, so that it protects public health while minimizing adverse effects from the interventions.<br/><br/>We will accomplish the above work through the following methods and innovations. LBS data can identify crowded locations at a scale of tens of meters and help screen for potential risk by analyzing the long range movement of individuals there. Worldwide video streams can yield finer-grained details of social closeness and other behavioral patterns desirable for accurate modeling. On the other hand, the videos may not be available for potentially high risk locations, nor can they directly answer ?what-if? questions. Videos from contexts similar to the one being modeled will be used to calibrate pedestrian dynamics model parameters, such as walking speeds. Then the trajectories of individual pedestrians will be simulated in the target locations to estimate social closeness. An infection transmission model will be applied to these trajectories to yield estimates of infection spread. This will result in a novel methodology to include diverse real time data into pedestrian dynamics models so that they can quickly and accurately capture human movement patterns in new and evolving situations. The cyberinfrastructure will automatically discover real-time video streams on the Internet and analyze them to determine the pedestrian density, movements, and social distances. The pedestrian dynamics model will be reformulated from the current force-based definition to one that uses pedestrian density and individual speed, both of which can be measured effectively through video analysis. The revised model will be used to produce scientific insight to inform policies, such as steps to mitigate localized outbreaks of COVID-19 and for the systematic reopening, potential re-closing, and permanent changes to economic and social activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

551	Catherine Eckel	TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Collaborative Research: The Impact of COVID-19 on Norms, Risk-taking, Information, and Trust	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has hit countries around the world hard and is likely to have both short-run and long-run impacts on health behaviors, social norms, and trust in government and other organizations. In the short run, governments and health organizations provide extensive information and recommend behavior to avoid contracting the disease and spreading it to others. This research involves surveys to figure out whether and to what extent people follow recommendations and change behavior. Because the research team has been following a sample of university students for several years, the team already knows a lot about them, and this facilitates an understanding of variation in compliance with recommendations. For example, risk-tolerance and trust in organizations are likely to matter. The team is exploring how people process information about the virus, and how that affects their beliefs about the risks to themselves and others. The researchers also are examining the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on social norms, and how those change over time. The second wave of the study looks for longer run impacts. The results of this study will be useful in shaping future policies and communications about health risks, especially during epidemics and other health crises.<br/> <br/>The researchers make use of previous samples of subjects to test the impact of COVID-19 information and recommendations on behavior, social norms, trust in each other and institutions, and risk-tolerance. They have four areas of study. The first is how people process ?noisy? information in the context of COVID-19. Prior research by a team member has shown that some individuals tend to misunderstand such information to their benefit. The teams adapt the methodology and protocol of the prior work to examine how individuals interpret COVID-19 information, and how this affects their beliefs about their own vulnerabilities. Second, the team studies the impact of COVID-19 on norms of behavior, including those directly related to the virus (social distancing, hand-washing), as well as norms of trust, sharing and in-group favoritism that may be shifting or newly emerging in response to COVID19. Prior work by a team member developed a methodology for eliciting social norms, and has shown that norms evolve in response to social influence. Third, they explore the impact of COVID-19 on interpersonal trust and trust in institutions, which significantly impacts willingness to follow government and organizational recommendations. Prior work by team members used incentivized games and surveys to study trust and reciprocity in natural disaster settings. Finally, they look at risk perception and risk taking related to COVID-19. Using incentivized measures of risk tolerance, and survey measures of domain-specific risk perceptions and behavior, the team explores the relationship between risk aversion and behavior, but also how the advent of COVID-19 has changed preferences for risk-taking. In these ways prior knowledge about the subjects provides an opportunity to study the impact of a national health catastrophe on information processing, social norms, trust and reciprocity and risk-taking.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

552	Paul Torrens	New York University	None	2020-04-15	2021-03-31	RAPID: Examining public spatial behavior during the COVID-19 outbreak	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the moment-to-moment activities of our daily public lives. Some communities have initiated restrictions on the movement, activities, physical interaction, and socialization of large sections of the population. These actions have been borne of necessity, in a bid to reduce human contact as part of widespread efforts to mitigate the potential spread of the virus. Social distancing measures have taken on a sense of urgency in population-dense metropolitan areas, which host a large portion of the COVID-19 cases. This project will launch a rapid effort to acquire high-resolution data regarding life on streetscapes during the pandemic, with the goal of producing quick-response insight as changes in public spatial behavior unfold. This will be done by capturing and coding immersive, first-person, geolocated video- diaries of metropolitan residents going about their daily streetscape activity, as life shifts to adapt to new social distancing and curfew orders. The data will be disseminated broadly through local community partnerships. Additionally, the project will fund four graduate students in diverse STEM related fields.<br/><br/>This research captures how new forms of spatial behavior emerge, while testing how existing theories of spatial behavior hold under extraordinary circumstances. The central innovation is to focus on individual embodiment in day-to-day streetscape scenes, as revealed in latent and overt spatial behavior through body language in public places. This will be accomplished through first-person video footage of everyday streetscape scenes from a group of recruited volunteers as they go about daily activities during a pandemic. The data will be hand and machine coded to explore patterns of spatial behavior that can indicate relationships between individuals, the built environment, and socio-behavioral phenomena. Emergent relationships will be fine-tuned, using a series of studio-based experiments after the fact, deploying motion capture to methodically and empirically trace-out pathways between non-verbal communication such as gestures and mannerisms, and high-resolution space-time details of spatial behavior, in a controlled setting that utilizes the collected video data as ground truth. To promote broader use of the data and to foster additional research, data will be collated?from both the field and from the studio experiments?using high-resolution space-time Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and virtual geographical environments. These resources will be made publicly available and shared with local partners, with implications for safeguarding public health and wellbeing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Crises like the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, however, pose a challenge to this long-standing norm that buttresses modern democracies the world over. In the midst of a crisis, individuals' support for the rule of law is tested because their fundamental concern for the health, safety, and welfare of themselves, their families, and their friends is pitted against an abstract belief that the government ?checks all the boxes? before carrying out potentially lifesaving policies. In these situations, one?s desire for decisive government action may overwhelm, and subsequently lead to a decline in, one?s commitment to abstract democratic principles like the rule of law. Consequently, evaluating how crises affect support for fundamental democratic norms is critical for understanding their impact on the health and stability of the liberal democratic order.<br/><br/>This project leverages the COVID-19 outbreak to examine this relationship and determine (a) whether governmental responses to crises affect citizens? support for the rule of law; (b) whether citizens? faith in government efforts is buttressed or undermined in response to elite and expert cues; and (c) whether citizens? attitudes change after a crisis has dissipated. Each of these theoretical aims is tied to one of three unique features of the research design, which relies upon surveys of European democracies. First, to examine the effects of governmental responses, the project will collect survey data on support for the rule of law across four Western democracies in April 2020: Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Second, an original panel survey in Germany will enable the evaluation of changes to individual-level rule of law judgments in the short, medium, and long term. Lastly, embedded survey experiments will provide causal evidence on how elite and expert cues affect both the acceptance of policies and support for key aspects of the rule of law, such as compliance with laws and support for judicial constraints on executive and legislative power. Findings from each part of the project will provide insights into the individual-level dynamics crises activate in citizens? relationship with democratic principles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

554	Mark Graham	YALE UNIVERSITY	None	2020-05-01	2022-04-30	RAPID: Instructional Shifts in Response to COVID-19 and Their Impacts on Classroom-based Undergraduate Research Experiences	Education and Human Resources - Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) greatly expand opportunities for students to participate in authentic research early in their academic career. Research participation is linked to increased student persistence in STEM, especially for students from groups that are underrepresented in STEM. Thus, by increasing the number and diversity of students who have a research experience, CURES also broaden participation in STEM careers. CURES typically engage student teams in hands-on work in laboratories or field sites. With the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, the national CURE education landscape quickly and dramatically changed to a fully ?online? mode, with limited opportunity for advance planning. Thus, this situation presents a unique and urgent opportunity to explore how CUREs evolve in a new online environment, as well as whether they continue to achieve core CURE educational goals. It also allows for assessment of whether these rapid course changes have equitable outcomes for all students, including first-generation students, students on financial aid, and from different socioeconomic backgrounds. If CUREs are a solution for engaging large numbers of early-stage undergraduates in authentic STEM research, then the feasibility to translate CUREs online must be known. It is important to understand the structure of these newly online CUREs, in what situation they are effective, and who they benefit. The results of this project have the potential to expand understanding of CURE instructional approaches and outcomes, for both practitioners and researchers. Additionally, this unexpected shift to online coursework is an opportunity to engage broader higher education audiences in new thinking about course configuration, online effectiveness, and supports and barriers for online teaching.<br/><br/>The purpose of this project is twofold: 1) capture and analyze how CURE course activities are rapidly translated into online formats; and 2) assess effects of course changes on students with different demographic profiles. It will provide early evidence to answer if, how, and why CURE benefits are realized through the different modality of online teaching. Importantly, this project will not make conclusions about the quality of online CUREs or online teaching overall; instead, it will explore which CURE activities can be readily delivered online, how they get delivered, how students respond, and how this new way of teaching changes/expands how instructors think about CUREs. The present project will use a mixed-methods design to track online implementation of CURE courses in two samples. The first sample will include a diverse set of local CUREs that span multiple STEM departments and have an array of course objectives/structures. This collection of CUREs will afford an in-depth, qualitative case study investigation that will capture and analyze instructors? thinking, plans, and products, before, during, and after the shift from hands-on, laboratory-based CUREs to ones that are now abruptly online. The second sample will include CURE courses from a national network, which will allow us to explore more broadly and in a more quantitative way, how a large number of instructors transitioned to online. The project will also examine the resulting emotions, motivations, and experiences of students during this transition and how this semester?s student outcomes compare to those from prior years, through analysis of a historical student outcomes database. This approach will provide broad reach and comparison among a relatively homogenous set of CUREs, since all CURE instructors in this network are trained in the same research approach, have similar course objectives, and use similar materials.

556	Alex Perkins	University of Notre Dame	None	2020-04-15	2021-03-31	RAPID: Real-time updating of an agent-based model to inform COVID-19 mitigation strategies.	Biological Sciences - The SARS-CoV-2 virus is responsible for the most significant pandemic in a century. With a vaccine not yet available, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) offer the only way to control the virus at this time. Those interventions, which include social distancing, school closures, and sheltering in place, may be effective if timed appropriately and adopted widely. At the same time, NPIs cause serious social and economic disruption, meaning that they must be used as sparingly as possible. To inform decisions about when to adopt NPIs, and when to relax them, it is important to understand what the consequences of those actions might be. This research will advance the capability of mathematical models to provide insight into those consequences. Looking to past data, the researchers will use statistical approaches to estimate key unknowns, such as numbers of people previously or actively infected. Looking into the future, the researchers will use simulation modeling of communities across the United States to evaluate the consequences of alternative actions. Merging these approaches will capitalize on the strengths of each, resulting in improved projections of the consequences of alternative strategies for mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.<br/><br/>This project will feature a geographically realistic, agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the United States. Advantages of this model include its detailed portrayal of the density, demography, and movement patterns of people in specific counties across the United States, and its ability to directly implement NPIs through behavior modification of agents. These features enable locally tailored projections of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and impacts of NPIs thereon. At the same time, the computational demands of agent-based models pose a challenge to using them in the fast-paced context of a pandemic. To overcome that challenge, the researchers will use less computationally demanding statistical approaches to estimate inputs for use in the agent-based model up to a given point in the pandemic. The agent-based model will then simulate forward from that time under alternative scenarios about use of NPIs. To further safeguard against computational demands being a limiting factor for producing timely results, the researchers will make use of high-performance computing resources to perform batches of simulations of the agent-based model that account for stochasticity and parameter uncertainty. Results will be publicly disseminated on a regular basis over the course of the project, and the researchers will coordinate with stakeholders to ensure that mitigation scenarios under consideration remain relevant as the pandemic progresses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

557	Manish Kumar	University of Texas at Austin	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Accessible Surfaces for Interrupting Sustained Coronavirus Transmission (ASsIST)	Engineering - The global COVID-19 pandemic causing considerable human health and economic impacts presents the research community with a unique set of urgent challenges that need to be addressed. One of the challenges is to slow the transmission of SARS-CoV2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The goal of this project is to design simple techniques to make protective materials that prevent virus transmission. To achieve this goal, virus particles will be designed to make virus research easier and safer. Materials that will be tested will be coated with readily available plant proteins to prevent virus transmission. These materials will include those used for masks, air conditioning filters, and work surfaces. The plant proteins are also easy to attach to surfaces such as cotton and other natural and synthetic fibers by simply immersing these materials in protein solutions. Models of COVID-19 will be created in two different methods: (1) a virus that normally infects bacteria will be modified to produce the ?spike? of SARS-CoV2 on its surface; (2)The spike protein will be inserted into synthetic lipid membrane droplets similar to those coating SARS-CoV2. These two non-pathogenic model viruses will allow widespread research into coronavirus and other emerging viruses without the need for highly protective specialized equipment. Successful completion of this research will inform efforts to protect the public and potentially lead to new effective nature-based protective measures against the spread of SARS-CoV2 and other similarly structured viruses.<br/><br/>SARS-CoV2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19) is a lipid enveloped virus with protruding spike proteins. The structure of the spike protein was recently determined by researchers at the University of Texas. The goal of this proposed research is to evaluate the ability of surfaces functionalized with specific plant-derived antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to bind this spike protein. These AMPs include two proteins obtained from aqueous extracts of the Moringa oleifera seed (MO): a chitin binding protein (MoCBP) and a cationic protein (MO2.1). The central hypotheses of the proposed work are: (i) specific binding of the SARS-CoV2 spike protein receptor binding domain using MoCBP-functionalized surfaces can be used as an effective removal technique, and (ii) MO2.1 on functionalized surfaces will inactivate SARS-CoV2 by damaging the lipid envelope of the virus. Recent simulation and experimental results demonstrate strong interactions of MoCBP with the purified spike protein from SARS-CoV2. To facilitate this research, we will develop a non-pathogenic model of SARS-CoV2 for rapid experimentation without the need for specialized safety equipment. The following tasks will be performed to test hypotheses and achieve the goal of this research: 1) test virus removal efficiency of MO-coated cotton from water and air by using filtration experiments with SARS-CoV2 spike protein and modified T7 bacteriophages displaying the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV2 as surrogates; 2) test the interaction of MO2.1 with the lipid membrane of SARS-CoV2 by using virus-like lipid particles amended with spike protein as virus surrogates to establish removal/inactivation; and 3) test the effectiveness of easily accessible surgical masks and HVAC filters coated with MO proteins in immobilizing SARS-CoV2. Successful completion of this research has great potential to lead to the development of effective technology for removal and protection against SARS-CoV2.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

558	Qi Wang	Northeastern University	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	RAPID/Collaborative Research: High-Frequency Data Collection for Human Mobility Prediction during COVID-19	Engineering - COVID-19 has and is continuing to dramatically alter the lives of millions of Americans as businesses, schools, and many public places have closed around the country. Recommendations of public officials along with individual concerns and fears have fundamentally changed the pattern of daily routines as Americans have adopted the practices of social distancing, sheltering in place, and even self-quarantine. This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project will improve our ability to assess and predict changes in mobility patterns under sudden disruptions caused by large-scale public health crises such as COVID-19. The specific focus will be to understand changes in mobility patterns and the complex and dynamic decision-making process shaping these changes during the unfolding events associated with this major public health crisis. The project will advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by greatly improving the preparedness and responses of public agencies facing COVID-19 and future similar public health crises. It will also help understand and predict reduction, change, and recovery of human mobility patterns promoting the progress of science in human mobility and urban resilience, in alignment with the mission of NSF.<br/><br/>The objectives of this RAPID project are to: (1) capture and ultimately predict spatiotemporal changes in the patterns of human mobility in response to the COVID-19 pandemic using social media data mining techniques; (2) perform high-frequency individual-level surveys via a smartphone app to understand motivational, decisional, and sentimental factors shaping changes in mobility patterns; and (3) explore conversion and convergence functions for high fidelity and high accuracy human mobility prediction. The intellectual merits of this research include: the discovery of unique mobility patterns emerging from this public health crises related to social distancing, sheltering, and self-quarantine practices; the unprecedented gathering of longitudinal evidence about the motivational, decisional and sentimental factors shaping mobility decisions; and the development of innovative algorithms of using a small representative sample for high-fidelity mobility prediction. The data and knowledge gained from the project will enhance future studies on urban mobility, travel demand and resource allocation modeling, and help policymakers assess the response and recovery of major urban metropolitan area facing a devastating disaster such as COVID-19. Project outcomes will be disseminated through the Boston Area Research Initiative (BARI), an inter-university partnership between Northeastern University and Harvard University, and through the MetroLab Network.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Biological Sciences - This research advances the national prosperity and the bioeconomy and enhances our understanding of the mechanisms that allow the spread of corona viruses between species. Results of this research may be the basis for identifying biomarkers of severity of disease or spread of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 or COVID). This project will produce an understanding of why some coronavirus strains that normally infect specific animals (such as birds and bats) sometimes also infect humans, whereas other strains do not. This knowledge is critical for understanding how viruses break species barriers to colonize new hosts and precipitate widespread infections, as experienced during the ongoing COVID pandemic. Coronaviruses infect cells by binding to specific cell surface receptors and passing through organelles known as endosomes and lysosomes to access the cell interior. This project will investigate how the environment within these cellular structures regulates the intensity of viral infection. Through the use of comparative biology across different vertebrate species, the goal will be to identify conditions in endosomes and lysosomes that facilitate infection in particular organisms. This research may be the basis for identifying biomarkers of severity of disease or COVID spread. This research will also provide tools to enable a broad research community working on COVID and other viruses. This proposal also uses funding to train graduate and undergraduate students. As such this funding is training the next generation of leaders in science. Results expected from this work will facilitate identification and control of COVID spread in humans and other animals. <br/><br/>The coronoaviridae (CoVs) are a family of single-stranded RNA viruses that infect three vertebrate groups: mammals, birds and fish. Understanding the molecular determinants underpinning this tropism, namely why CoVs naturally and efficiently infect these species, and target specific tissues within these animals, is a fundamental biological concept. Definition of the mechanisms restricting CoV tropism is therefore critical for our understanding of how CoVs break species barriers and colonize new hosts. In this RAPID proposal, the role of the luminal microenvironment of the endolysosomal system in determining the efficiency of CoV infection will be studied for different CoVs in different vertebrate species. The central hypothesis is that the cellular proteins called ion channels resident in endosomes and lysosomes are differentially present in lower mammals and humans. Furthermore, these ion channels uniquely create environments within endosomes and lysosomes in lower mammals that are critical for supporting coronaviral infection and the differential expression of endolysosomal ion channels between tissues and species regulates the effectiveness of CoV infection. This hypothesis will be tested using a variety of cell models, imaging approaches and infection assays. This research is supported by the Symbiosis, Defense and Self-recognition program of the National Science Foundation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

560	Yulia Gel	University of Texas at Dallas	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Collaborative Research: Operational COVID-19 Forecasting with Multi-Source Information	Mathematical and Physical Sciences - This project aims to develop a new deep learning predictive platform for COVID-19 transmission, integrating multi-source information under model and data uncertainties. In contrast to other viruses such as influenza, SARS, and MERS, COVID-19 differs in a number of ways, including uncertainties in response to weather conditions, history of the disease, as well as the effectiveness of responses from public health officials or from the general public. An important aspect is to integrate multi-source data such as official reports, atmospheric variables, and social media data into operational biosurveillance and real-time prediction of COVID-19. The proposed biosurveillance framework will be used to forecast COVID-19 dynamics and to enhance mitigation strategies. In addition, it could also be applicable to tracking many other infectious diseases, thereby contributing to security of our society as a whole. Furthermore, the project will build innovative connections within and across mathematical biology, statistics, and deep learning, with a strong focus on interdisciplinary graduate research training.<br/><br/>As the main forecasting framework, the widely used Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) dynamic models can accurately describe the disease dynamics, but only with precise knowledge of disease parameters, which can take a long time to accurately estimate. Deep learning algorithms can potentially have superior predictive ability, but they require extensive training. Another key challenge in the statistical modeling of these events is how to timely and systematically integrate multiple sources of surveillance, anecdotal, and other health-related information under uncertainty. The proposed new predictive approach is based on the interaction between multiple data sources, dynamical SEIR models, and deep learning algorithms. The key idea is to view simulation SEIR models as ?surrogate? pre-trainers for the deep learning models, resulting in less real data needed to retrain the predictive model to reflect ?real world? COVID-19 progression.

Real-time location traces of individuals can be used to significantly speed up and scale up contact tracing. However, such use also heightens concerns on individual privacy and data abuse. Urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic requires a careful balance of privacy protection with public health benefits. This project aims to develop techniques and a mobile application, REACT, for REAal-time Contact Tracing and risk monitoring via privacy-enhanced tracking of users' locations and symptoms. To enhance privacy, users can control and refine the frequency and granularity with which their information will be collected and used. REACT will enable: 1) contact tracing of individuals and locations that a confirmed case has contact with for quarantine and decontamination to control further spread, 2) individual risk monitoring based on the locations they visit and their contact with others so they can be informed and alerted; and 3) community risk monitoring and detection of early signals of community spread to prepare for larger-scale infections. <br/><br/>The project will develop and study: 1) efficient and scalable data structures and algorithms for contact tracing queries given a large number of users and multi-resolution location traces; 2) a learning-based approach for modeling users? risks in real time; 3) a social network sensors approach for monitoring the community risk, and 4) a multi-stage privacy approach where users can upload generalized locations to receive alerts and more precise locations when they are notified as possible contacts with confirmed cases for refinement and confirmation. More rigorous privacy enhancements will be studied including location perturbation based on geo-indistinguishability and its variants and searchable encryption for contact tracing on encrypted locations. In addition, the project includes a set of dissemination and education activities: 1) releasing a mobile app with open-source system components; 2) investigating privacy-preserving mechanisms to share the collected data for research studies; and 3) integrating the research in classes and organizing seminar series and tutorials to promote the interdisciplinary research area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

562	Georgiy Bobashev	Research Triangle Institute	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Collaborative Research: Operational COVID-19 Forecasting with Multi-Source Information	Mathematical and Physical Sciences - This project aims to develop a new deep learning predictive platform for COVID-19 transmission, integrating multi-source information under model and data uncertainties. In contrast to other viruses such as influenza, SARS, and MERS, COVID-19 differs in a number of ways, including uncertainties in response to weather conditions, history of the disease, as well as the effectiveness of responses from public health officials or from the general public. An important aspect is to integrate multi-source data such as official reports, atmospheric variables, and social media data into operational biosurveillance and real-time prediction of COVID-19. The proposed biosurveillance framework will be used to forecast COVID-19 dynamics and to enhance mitigation strategies. In addition, it could also be applicable to tracking many other infectious diseases, thereby contributing to security of our society as a whole. Furthermore, the project will build innovative connections within and across mathematical biology, statistics, and deep learning, with a strong focus on interdisciplinary graduate research training.<br/><br/>As the main forecasting framework, the widely used Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) dynamic models can accurately describe the disease dynamics, but only with precise knowledge of disease parameters, which can take a long time to accurately estimate. Deep learning algorithms can potentially have superior predictive ability, but they require extensive training. Another key challenge in the statistical modeling of these events is how to timely and systematically integrate multiple sources of surveillance, anecdotal, and other health-related information under uncertainty. The proposed new predictive approach is based on the interaction between multiple data sources, dynamical SEIR models, and deep learning algorithms. The key idea is to view simulation SEIR models as ?surrogate? pre-trainers for the deep learning models, resulting in less real data needed to retrain the predictive model to reflect ?real world? COVID-19 progression. Deep learning predictive models can then be used for making predictions about the future COVID-19 dynamics, which can be compared to the predictions made by the original SEIR model. Depending on which mathematical model makes better predictions, another model can be updated with the better prediction as inputs, thereby representing reinforcement learning from both data and the best mathematical model.

563	John Jonides	University of Michigan Ann Arbor	None	2020-04-01	2021-03-31	RAPID: Factors that affect understanding the risks of COVID-19	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - The threat of the COVID-19 virus has not been clearly understood by a substantial portion of the U.S. population. Many people have been slow to adopt attitudes and behaviors that will serve to mitigate the risks of the pandemic. With all the publicity that the virus has engendered, how can this be so? The researchers hypothesize that these failures to change attitude and behavior stem from three factors: failures to realize the impact that this disease has, failures to realize how quickly it will be transmitted, and failures to appreciate the dire consequences it will have on the health care system. In this study, the researcher will examine factors underlying these failures and ways to improve delivery of information relevant to COVID-19. Results and suggestions for improving communication and comprehension are expected to be disseminated widely and expeditiously.<br/><br/>In order to investigate ways of improving the understanding of the risks involving COVID-19, the researchers, a highly experienced and inter-disciplinary team, propose three lines of research. They will examine (a) how different ways of presenting information about the proliferation of the disease affects people?s estimates of its incidence and rates of death, as well as intended future social behavior, (b) how individual differences among individuals and countries along demographic and trait dimensions will influence their estimates of the spread of the disease, and (c) how people are reasoning about the impact of the disease on the viability of the healthcare system. Methods will include measuring the ability to predict risk and consequences of the disease as well as the impact of ?flattening the curve? as functions of several variables, including mode of information presentation, numeracy, motivation, health status, and other demographic and trait variables.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

This award is made by the AISL program in the Division of Research on Learning, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The project will develop and research an integrated package of high-quality, widely accessible media and other outreach materials designed to engage middle school youth, educators, and libraries in learning about viruses in relation to COVID-19. There is an immediate need to provide youth with accurate, engaging, and accessible materials to help them understand the basic biology underlying the COVID-19 pandemic, including the routes of COVID-19 transmission and mechanisms to prevent its spread. This is particularly important for those without science backgrounds or interests so that the rumors, hearsay, and gossip circulating among youth can be replaced with research-based information. Since 2007, the project team and partners have focused on developing and studying new ways of educating youth and the public about biology, virology, and infectious disease. The project will develop a web-accessible package of customizable graphics, illustrated stories, and essays?all of which can be easily incorporated into free-choice and directed on-line learning as well standards-based lesson plans for Grades 6-8. These resources will be disseminated broadly and at no cost to youth and educators of all kinds, including schools, libraries, museums, and other established networks for formal and informal science education. The project web package will be linked to multiple websites that serve as important educational resources on science and virology for youth, the general public, and educators. A prominent university press will publish and promote the illustrated stories and support distribution of 7,000 free copies. <br/><br/>The project will conduct research examining how richly-illustrated science narratives impact youth understanding of and curiosity about science. The research will help develop the foundation for better understanding how to educate youth about COVID-19 (and future pandemics) while generating new knowledge about effective methods for public science outreach during a major unanticipated natural event. For formative evaluation, the project will use an innovative rapid response feedback method. Youth will be invited to provide timely, specific comments on the serialized stories through a curated portal. As new excerpts are related online, different questions will be posed to youth who are selected because of specific characteristics (e.g., low or high initial science interest). These data will guide story development in real time and provide a mechanism to gauge the story appeal, comprehensibility, and initial impacts. The project will address two research questions: ?How effective are illustrated stories in having positive impacts among participants on COVID-19 knowledge, science identity, attitudes, and interest in science careers?? and ?How do story lines and characters have differential impacts on virus knowledge, epidemiology, and youth attitudes towards science and science careers?? To conduct this research, the project will conduct online surveys using adapted items from prior research conducted by the project team. Additional items will assess COVID-19 knowledge, attitudes, personal experiences with the virus, well-being, and exposure to public health messaging about the virus. Research findings will be shared widely to inform the field about new ways delivering science education content during the advent of rapidly evolving global and educational challenges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

565	David Schaefer	University of California-Irvine	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Social Network Consequences for Underrepresented STEM Students as a University Transitions to Remote Activities	Education and Human Resources - The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted universities worldwide to abruptly shift to remote learning. This coincides with a critical social change as students are urged to leave campus, ?social distance,? and shelter-in-place; practices that will disrupt social network functioning and could lead to feelings of isolation, reduced motivation, and poorer learning outcomes. Worse, the social and academic consequences could be more severe for less academically prepared students (e.g., underrepresented minorities, first-generation college, low socioeconomic status) and first year students in particular, who are still adjusting to college life (e.g., building social networks, learning university culture). Given the uncertainty of the current situation, it is critical to understand how the pandemic and the "social distance" triggered by it may influence student social networks and whether disparities in social and academic outcomes result. This RAPID was submitted in response to the NSF Dear Colleague letter related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This award is made by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program in the Division of Research on Learning, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. <br/><br/>The goal of this RAPID research project is to investigate how the shift to remote learning triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting social networks, psycho-social adjustment, and academic outcomes for first-year STEM majors, and whether disparities emerge for students from subgroups historically more likely to leave STEM. The research will examine these potential impacts, and how risks might be offset by an existing intervention at the University of California Irvine (UCI) -- the Enhanced Academic Success Experience (EASE) program. EASE is a learning community designed to improve academic outcomes for under-prepared students, with one-third of the approximately 1,000 first-year majors in the School of Biological Sciences (Bio Sci) participating each year. To date, research on the intervention has provided strong causal evidence that EASE has successfully increased motivation, engagement, and belongingness, with stronger effects for groups typically underrepresented within STEM. As part of the intervention, researchers have gathered longitudinal network data that are unique in both scale (~1,000 students/year within a major) and coverage (85-96% response rate). This research will characterize changes in friendship and study networks, psycho-social adjustment, and academic outcomes that result from the unprecedented shift to remote organizational activities. The new data collection and analysis will explore whether the shift to remote learning creates disparities in these important outcomes for subgroups of STEM students and whether the learning community provided by EASE may mitigate these effects. Through supplementary data collection, the study will consider how student networks have adapted to the organizational shift to remote learning and where students are obtaining the kinds of emotional and instrumental support they need. Mediation analysis will offer insight into which network characteristics explain psycho-social and academic consequences of the shift to remote learning. More generally, the unique data will enable assessment of how social networks adapt to societal-level disruption caused by the pandemic, and how well-implemented institutional support may offset the anticipated risks associated with the pandemic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Daily Well-Being, Social Experiences, and Academic Persistence in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - Rapid societal shifts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have necessitated that education move online. Such shifts also increase students? exposure to online discrimination, which can in turn negatively impact students? academic performance and development. Prior research suggests that discrimination can push students away from pursuing STEM careers at a moment when a diverse, interdisciplinary STEM workforce is critical to confronting complex scientific challenges. In traditional in-person educational settings, positive interactions with diverse classmates and instructors can facilitate the maintenance of cognitive performance, educational attainment, and STEM participation despite negative experiences. Whether these positive interactions transfer to an online context, and whether they similarly buffer the effects of discrimination, is less understood. This study captures important daily variations in students? well-being and academic outcomes that can inform future university practices regarding education and student wellness during crises. The findings may be of particular interest to educational institutions that have been forced to quickly shift to online instruction. As the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates, there is a need for novel ideas and excellent leadership in STEM fields. This study will identify factors that may protect and promote STEM career outcomes.<br/><br/>This project capitalizes on an existing ethnically diverse sample of college STEM majors who previously (pre-pandemic) reported on their daily in-class experiences, well-being, and academic outcomes. The present study collects additional data, using nearly identical methods, across two 7-day cycles. The project aims to: (1) Describe the frequency of daily discrimination experienced by college-aged ethnically diverse STEM majors; (2) Assess the extent to which rates of discrimination differ from their pre-pandemic levels; (3) Examine whether daily discrimination is correlated with STEM students? day-to-day well-being, academic efficacy, and outcome expectations for their future STEM careers; and (4) Explore digital peer and university social supports as moderators of associations between daily discrimination and outcomes in a context of limited in-person interaction. Exploratory open-ended questions will identify participants? educational experiences related to COVID-19.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

567	Massimo Franceschetti	University of California-San Diego	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: A Controlled Response to COVID-19	Computer and Information Science and Engineering - The forecast and containment of epidemics are central themes in public health and are well-studied in the literature through modeling and simulations. In the case of COVID-19, the lack of a vaccine, and the limited response to treatment, can lead to possible acute respiratory complications that may nevertheless be non-lethal, provided that patients have access to respiratory support in intensive-care units equipped with ventilation machines. Proactive planning and optimal allocation of resources are key challenges to face in the current emergency. In this scenario, the project studies the response to the pandemic from a network service point of view. Namely, it aims at determining actionable strategies under which the hospitals' response system can reach an equilibrium state where the spreading of the infection occurs, but the spreading rate does not lead to service overflow. There has been widespread recognition on the need to ?flatten the curve,? representative of the infection spreading, and different strategies to achieve this objective have been enforced by governments across the world. The project?s research can be viewed in this context as a principled approach to predict how ?the curve? will respond to different strategies, whether it can be kept below the hospitals' saturation threshold for a given amount of time, and what is the societal cost required to achieve this objective. <br/><br/>Given a service-rate constraint dictated by hospital capacity and dynamic equations describing the spread of the infection, the project aims at deriving a control policy expressed in terms of public-health policies that meets the-service rate constraint of the local health-care system while minimizing their economic impact. Since societal constraints can make such an optimal strategy cost-prohibitive, or infeasible, the project will also study strategies that, given a certain cost budget, lead to the most desirable (time-varying) arrival rate that minimizes the global mortality rate of the population. While derived solutions are expected to be optimal in the context of the proposed dynamical-system model, results will also be validated using extensive simulations driven by real population data, in order to demonstrate their wider applicability in a practical setting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

568	John Coley	Northeastern University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Collaborative Research: Designing an Educational Intervention to Address Intuitive Misconceptions about COVID-19	Education and Human Resources - Misconceptions about the transmission of COVID-19 can lead to noncompliance with preventive public health recommendations. The first goal of this project, led by researchers at Boston University and Northeastern University, is to understand the deeper conceptual nature of these biological misconceptions. The research will explore whether these ideas are specific to COVID-19 or whether they reflect intuitive reasoning patterns of reasoning about biological phenomena more generally, and how prevalent they are in early elementary school children. A further focus of this research will be on caregivers and teachers?adults who are important sources of information to children. Prior NSF-funded research has shown that misconceptions about biological phenomena emerge early in development and can become entrenched. Therefore, the second major goal of this research is the rapid design and testing of a pilot educational intervention that addresses children?s and adults? reasoning about COVID-19 and also incorporates more general information about the causal mechanisms that underlie biological contagion. The intervention will be modeled on earlier interventions by the investigators that used animated narratives to teach complex biological concepts successfully to children and adults. This RAPID award is made by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program in DRL, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. ECR supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning.<br/><br/>Humans possess powerful intuitive explanatory and inferential tendencies that provide fast and efficient ? but sometimes fallible ? guidelines for making sense of complex phenomena in the biological world. Prior NSF-funded work has shown how these tendencies?for example, intuitive teleological, essentialist, and anthropocentric modes of reasoning?emerge early and act as filters on the learning of biological information at all ages. Sometimes these intuitions are consistent with formal biological reasoning and can be leveraged in the classroom to support learning, but sometimes they are not and lead to systematic and entrenched biological misconceptions across development. Information about COVID-19 is no exception. In this project, the researchers will: (1) investigate intuitive reasoning about the causal mechanisms of COVID-19 transmission and infection?along with reasoning about illness more generally?among teachers and caregivers of 1st - 2nd grade students; (2) conduct parallel investigations with the 1st - 2nd grade students themselves; and (3) rapidly design and pilot test a cognitively-informed educational intervention on COVID-19, and related illnesses, for elementary children, caregivers, and teachers based on the evidence that will be gleaned from these investigations. In order to understand the influence on children of adults? reasoning about COVID-19?and disease more generally?this project will develop child and adult versions of a survey instrument consisting of: (a) an open-ended interview on the causality, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19; (b) a risky behavior detection task to assess knowledge and beliefs about the risks of common behaviors; (c) a causal knowledge assessment that asks more generally about the mechanisms of illness transmission and infection. These measures will be administered via online research. Insights gained from these measures will be quickly used to develop a pilot intervention that will use an animated narrative video to supported children's and adults? mechanistic understanding of COVID-19 and related disease transmission and prevention. Pre- and post-testing will determine the effectiveness of this pilot intervention and lay the foundation for future research and intervention. This research will shed light on children?s and adults? understandings about COVID-19, and the degree to which children?s ideas are shaped by intuitive explanatory tendencies and that misconceptions can be exacerbated by specific misinformation from caregivers and teachers. It will also illuminate cognitively-informed ways to educate adults about complex biological phenomena as a way of addressing misconceptions in the children with whom they interact.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

569	John MacArthur	Portland State University	None	2020-04-15	2021-03-31	Collaborative Research: RAPID: Maintain Mobility and Reduce Infection Through a Resilient Transit and Micromobility System	Engineering - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented disruptions to health, the economy, and transportation systems in cities. The key strategy to combat growth in the infection rate is through "social distancing," maintaining physical separation from others. This strategy is incompatible with transit systems and ridership in nearly every transit market has plunged, causing agencies to reduce service levels to protect riders and employees. Still, mobility is required in many cities and the ability of cities to rapidly recover from widespread economic shutdown will require improving mobility systems in urban areas. In the past decade, more diverse shared mobility systems have proliferated, potentially improving the resilience and redundancy of the urban transportation system. Most recently, micromobility systems (i.e., bike share and scooter share) have entered cities and supplemented transportation systems in those areas. As a shared personal mobility vehicle, micromobility vehicles have been highly utilized in some markets in the early weeks of the pandemic even as transit ridership has declined. This is an important opportunity to understand how shared micromobility systems complement transit and can support social distancing to limit spread of disease while also facilitating urban transportation recovery. To that end, this study has two main aims. First, the research team will conduct a series of panel surveys for the duration of the pandemic of transit and micromobility users in two medium-sized transportation markets (Nashville and Portland) that have robust micromobility markets. These surveys will query and model mode choice behavior in relation to social distancing requirements, transit captivity, job status, income, activity restrictions, and others. The research team seeks to understand if riders self-regulate transit use and exposure and balance their behavior with perceived risks. The team will use detailed agency and micromobility operator data to track changes in ridership during recovery. The second aim is to project those findings on more aggregate ridership data of transit and micromobility across cities of different sizes and with different COVID-19 infection rates. This will provide detailed understanding of how riders react to pandemic in regard to two main shared modes; transit and micromobility systems. <br/><br/>To date there has been little work on the response of transit to disease outbreaks. The 2002/2003 SARS outbreak provides some aggregate evidence of long-duration drops in transit ridership. This work will provide important insight into disaggregate rider behavior, disease transmission, and personal- and community-risk tolerance. Moreover, this work will explore how emergent modes, like shared micromobility provide opportunities to maintain mobility while reducing close personal contact. Models developed can help predict how city transit systems will recover after a public health crisis. Public health emergencies will continue into the future and preparation on how to react to such emergencies will be important. For example, micromobility systems may provide much needed transportation services to supplement limited transit service. Understanding the dual roles of micromobility and transit will assist in limiting disease transmission and recovering the transportation system. Policy responses could be based on evidence generated in this study for the current and future infectious disease pandemics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Specifically, the project investigates how traffic volumes are changing as a result of changes in daily patterns of life, as well as how those shifts in traffic volume affect network utilization, network performance, and application performance. These questions have become increasingly critical during the COVID-19 pandemic, as large fractions of the population have come to depend on reliable Internet access that performs well for a variety of applications, from video conferencing to remote learning and healthcare. It is important to understand how various policies involving isolation, distancing, and closing of schools, libraries and services are affecting the usage patterns on the Internet, right at the time when the entire society is coming to rely on the network more than ever.<br/><br/>This project will involve an unprecedented coordination of data about network traffic load under crisis, through granular measurements, propriety data sharing agreements, as well as extensive baseline data spanning over ten years. This project aims to study two fundamental research questions: (1) What is the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on network traffic patterns on broadband access networks? and (2) How well do (and will) the infrastructure and applications sustain these changes in traffic patterns? To study these questions, the project plans to take a multi-faceted approach, exploring issues including access performance and interconnect capacity when using critical applications when the network is under strain. <br/><br/>This measurement study will shed light on the extent to which the existing Internet infrastructure can sustain exogenous shocks that dramatically shift the location, nature, and scale of network traffic and help identify vulnerabilities. Insights into the state of broadband Internet performance will yield important insights about how broader government policies to close schools and rely on remote e-learning may affect the broader population. Understanding the increased strain on the Internet on other application areas in medicine and public health, including patient compliance and remote caregiving, may lead to improved design of the Internet for such application areas.

How individuals interpret, understand, and respond to that risk have important implications for the transmission of the COVID-19 virus, SARS-CoV-2. This research leverages the ubiquity of SARS-CoV-2 amid varying community, regional, and national responses to test theories about the transmission of behavioral norms, linking individual characteristics (identities, homophily, transmission biases such as conformity or prestige risk management, and demographics), sources of information about the virus, and effects on transmission. Coupled contagion modeling has tended to be limited to demonstration of concept. The incorporation of real time behavioral response data in the modeling of couple contagion improves prospects for improved epidemic control through the promotion of pro-social behavior. This project will train students from under-represented minorities and a post-doctoral scholar in epidemiology. Results will be made immediately available to the public and will inform development of educational material. <br/><br/>This project will study the coupled contagion dynamics of COVID-19 and related behavioral responses, including (but not limited to) increased hygiene (e.g., hand-washing), social distancing, social gathering (purposeful resistance to distancing), hoarding of supplies, and signaling of either alarm or defiance in response to official reports of threat. Investigators will collect data longitudinally in three waves starting from severe non-pharmaceutical interventions such as "lockdowns" through the expected course of the epidemic. Surveys will assess risk-reduction behaviors, compliance with public-health mandates, and hypothesized predictors of response including trust in various institutions, social capital, and sources of news and information. To complement the empirical data collection, the investigators will develop and analyze mathematical and simulation-based models that jointly track the dynamics of virus transmission and behavior change. The models will be parameterized with data collected in the survey. Particular focus will be given to the consequences of behaviors driven by conflicting messages about seriousness and the appropriateness of different types of interventions for disease transmission. An important goal of this modeling is to develop insights for improving public-health interventions, motivating compliance, and ensuring that effective and accessible information about the virus is available to the public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

573	Folashade Agusto	University of Kansas Center for Research Inc	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: COVID-19 Behavior, Perception, and Control Across Geographic and Economic Gradients	Mathematical and Physical Sciences - COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by a recently discovered, novel coronavirus. Since its discovery in Wuhan, China, in 2019, COVID-19 has already led to over 2 million cases globally. It has spread globally, including to many vulnerable countries without adequate healthcare infrastructures. Many different responses have been tried, including social distancing, school and event closings, and travel bans. This project will develop mathematical models to address three fundamental questions: 1) how much participation and coordinated control is needed for effective protection? 2) what independent control efforts can compensate for lack of coordination to achieve effective protection? and 3) how do community population demographics, socioeconomic conditions, and health care infrastructure impact outcomes? This project aims to inform coordination of disease control policies at all scales (local, regional, national, international) to aid in curtailing the ongoing and future outbreaks. This project will advance fundamental understanding of the impacts of control efforts via a new risk perception-driven infectious disease model, and predict which drivers of public demand for community-level control efforts might lead to potentially harmful long-term decisions. The project will involve training two doctoral students in techniques related to mathematical modeling of disease dynamics and spread. <br/><br/>Many mitigation options are being weighed and implemented for COVID-19, with different decisions made at different administrative levels, including alternative quarantine strategies and different degrees of ?lockdown?. All of these decisions come with different perceptions of risk. The PIs will develop and analyze disease transmission models that incorporate various factors including public perception of risk, age-structure with a hospitalized population, and spatial structure with different scales spanning local communities to an entire country. These models will be used to explore impacts of community population demographics, socioeconomic conditions, and health care infrastructures, and how these factors impact control efforts under different social and economic settings. With the results of these models, policy- and decision-makers can consider the impacts of specific features of the communities under their administration as contributors to a broader network of public health efforts and choose the optimal mitigation steps. This work will inform coordination of disease control policies to curtail the ongoing outbreak directly. The results of this project, while tailored specifically to inform COVID-19 virus control strategies, will be applicable to any novel infectious disease outbreak in the future.<br/><br/><br/>This award is being funded by the CARES Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

574	Katriona Shea	Pennsylvania State Univ University Park	None	2020-04-15	2021-03-31	RAPID: Harnessing the power of multiple models for outbreak management	Biological Sciences - For many of the most damaging or worrying pathogens, such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19, multiple scientific groups develop quantitative models to forecast disease dynamics and assess possible interventions. These models often differ significantly in their projections and recommendations, reflecting different policy assumptions, as well as scientific, logistical, and other uncertainty about biological and management processes. Such uncertainty can be challenging for policymakers, hindering intervention planning and response. Policymakers may thus choose to rely on single trusted sources of advice, or on consensus where it appears, without confidence that decisions will be the best possible. However, less-than-optimal decisions mean more lives may be lost or more resources used than needed. In the face of biological, epidemiological, and operational uncertainties, systematic strategies to formalize the process of using multiple models to develop policy can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of policy responses to outbreaks. The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak is a major health issue for most countries in the world. This work is intended to directly address this current problem in real time. The work will also provide a framework for future outbreak response. <br/><br/>Many models to address the COVID-19 pandemic are in development, or recently published. This project will develop multiple-model elicitation protocols, embedded in a strong framework for decision making, that formally acknowledges our uncertainty about this novel pathogen, and avoids known sources of bias. A full acknowledgment and accounting of uncertainty is critical both for decision making and for public communication. Nationally relevant objectives (e.g., minimizing deaths) and interventions (e.g., social distancing) will be assessed during this process. The project will merge formal expert elicitation methods (usually used to elicit opinions from individual experts) with modeling analyses from multiple research groups to enhance decision making for outbreak management. Groups will project disease dynamics under different interventions, and the ensemble of outputs will be analyzed using decision analysis to provide an evaluation of interventions against the policy makers? objectives. The project will conduct this exercise to address key policy decision-making needs in the face of uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

575	Stilianos Louca	University of Oregon Eugene	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Improved phylogenetic approaches for characterizing the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19	Biological Sciences - Phylogenetic trees constructed from viral genomes sampled from patients contain information about the historical pattern of transmission and dispersal of infectious diseases. Mathematical models of evolution allow researchers to infer critical epidemiological parameters, such as the transmission rate, from the information encoded in phylogenetic trees. Because future predictions and policy decisions depend on these estimates, it is crucial that their accuracy and limitations are well understood. Recent findings suggest that many commonly used mathematical models of disease evolution may yield highly inaccurate parameter estimates and may severely underestimate the associated uncertainty, thus potentially leading to sub-optimal policy decisions that are either ineffective or needlessly disruptive. This project will clarify precisely what epidemiological insights can be reliably inferred from phylogenetic trees and will develop new approaches to robustly characterize the spatial and temporal spread of COVID-19. Further, the project will determine which environmental, biological and policy factors affect the spread of COVID-19 based on phylogenetic data. The computational methods developed will be shared as standalone open source R packages that can be used for analyzing and guiding decisions against ongoing and future epidemics.<br/><br/>This project will use mathematical and computational methods to examine how and to what extent transmission, recovery and detection rates as well as the basic reproduction ratio (R0) and pathogen prevalence could possibly be estimated from phylogenetic data. The project will focus on models commonly used in phylogenetic epidemiology, including birth-death-sampling models and coalescent models with variable rates through time. The project will investigate whether the likelihood function of these models can be brought into special forms that reveal which epidemiological scenarios can possibly be statistically distinguished, similarly to the researchers' recent work on macroevolutionary birth-death models. Further, the researchers will develop more robust measures to characterize pathogen population dynamics over space and time from phylogenetic data, than currently possible. To that end, they will simulate a large number of epidemiological models and search for quantities that are preserved across statistically indistinguishable scenarios. The researchers will focus on the SARS-CoV-2 clade (the virus causing COVID-19) and will examine the implications of their findings for COVID-19 spread dynamics, based on published genomic data. In particular, they will perform comparative analyses between SARS-CoV-2 sub-clades as well as over space and time, to determine how various environmental, biological and policy factors affect the spread of the virus.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

576	Jeannette Wing	Columbia University	None	2020-05-15	2020-10-31	RAPID: COVID Information Commons (CIC)	Office of the Director - This project will create a COVID Information Commons (CIC) website to facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration across various COVID research efforts, especially focusing on all the NSF-funded COVID Rapid Response Research (RAPID) projects. The CIC will serve as a resource for researchers as well as decision-makers from government, academia, not-for-profit and industry to leverage each other's findings, and invest in and accelerate the most promising research to mitigate the broad societal impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. It will also serve as a model for integrated knowledge sharing and collaboration on other public health challenges, in benefit to society. Projects will be able to enter and publish information about their efforts in ways that are most relevant and user-friendly for a variety of potential stakeholders from academia, industry, government, and non-profit sectors. Information will be organized in multiple ways, for example, by research topics areas and by geography. In addition to information from NSF COVID-19 RAPID projects, the COVID Information Commons will incorporate coronavirus-related information from NSF Open Knowledge Network projects, as well as from other NSF research projects in general. <br/><br/>The COVID Information Commons will utilize information science methods to bring together information about the collection of COVID-19 RAPID projects funded by the National Science Foundation. A wide array of research efforts are underway to study the impacts of the pandemic in fields as far ranging as biophysics, social justice/inequity, behavioral science, public health, supply chains, and risk management. The CIC will semantically link information across projects to provide a more holistic view across distinct efforts, including efforts such as the COVID projects in the NSF Open Knowledge Network. The resulting, concise, curated, integrated resource will provide insight into NSF-funded COVID RAPID projects and facilitate collaborations among such efforts. These objectives will be achieved using information science approaches to 1) compile a comprehensive list of NSF COVID RAPID awards, along with relevant details for each project, 2) link to any publicly available data sets and data feeds, 3) organize the information and data feeds, for example, by categories of research areas and/or geography, using a meta-data schema developed for the resource and existing taxonomy and semantic frameworks; 4) design and develop a web portal to allow project teams to publish their data, or links to the data, and present project information in ways that are most relevant and user friendly for researchers in academia, industry, and government; 5) integrate the schema.org COVID-19 annotated data to enable more effective identification, retrieval, and integration of relevant data. A Minimum Viable Product for the website will be developed first, working with stakeholders in the community to prioritize features and add new functionality. In addition to the Information Commons, the project will also assess the effort and feasibility of implementing a data and model commons?to share datasets as well as data-driven models, such as machine learning models related to COVID-19.<br/><br/>This RAPID award is made by the Convergence Accelerator program in the Office of Integrative Activities with funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

577	Yury Dvorkin	New York University	None	2020-06-01	2021-05-31	RAPID: RETrofitting REsiliency AgainsT COVID-19! (RETREAT COVID-19!)	Engineering - In densely populated urban environments, such physical infrastructure systems as gas, electric power and water networks are critical enablers of shelter-at-home policies that help slow down the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. However, from the infrastructure viewpoint, these policies cause a major shift of gas, electricity and water consumption to residential rather than commercial neighborhoods, which may face unusual demand profiles for infrastructure services, possibly leading to outages and inability (or limited ability) to serve sheltered population groups. Such outages take societally unacceptable death tolls, even without factoring in the effect of the COVID-19 outbreak. For example, only among medically insured Americans, the estimated number of electricity-dependent persons residing at home was 685,000 (2012), among whom roughly one fifth is vulnerable to even short 3-4 hour power outages. The main goal of this proposal is to analyze infrastructure operations under different scenarios of disease outbreaks, using real-life infrastructure and public health data from New York City, and inform infrastructure operators and urban planners on efficient strategies to mitigate public health risks. In these analyses, the project team will specially focus on needs of vulnerable population groups.<br/><br/>The main technical objective of this proposal is to bridge the current gap between infrastructure and epidemic models to understand how the demand of infrastructure services change under different outbreak scenarios. To this end, we will first internalize the effects of health epidemics in infrastructure models. The epidemics model will include Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) and Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) models, which make it possible to reasonably simulate the spread of infectious diseases as flu and influenza (SIS) and measles, mumps, rubella (SIR). Second, using real-life data on the COVID-19 outbreak in NYC and models of gas, electricity, transportation and water systems, our research team will carry out an infrastructure vulnerability analysis under different outbreak scenarios, which will be appropriately designed to represent potential trajectories of the COVID-19 outbreak (e.g. "bell" shape, when the outbreak peaks and then gradually decays or the "W" shape, when the outbreak can have multiple peaks). We will develop outage models of critical infrastructure equipment (water pumps, gas compressors, electric power transformers) in order to adequately capture accelerated wear-and-tear of these resources due to the atypical and shifted usage during the outbreaks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

578	Andrew Danowitz	California Polytechnic State University Foundation	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Engineering Student Mental Wellness During the COVID-19 Pandemic	Engineering - As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, some students will fall ill, potentially critically, while others will face the prospect of sick family members, and even deaths in the family. These experiences are likely to expose students to stress, uncertainty, and fear that may affect their mental health and academic performance for years to come. This study?s contribution will be significant because by studying the effects of the pandemic and academy?s response to it on engineering students, engineering departments will be able to create tailored approaches to help students recover and stay on track for graduation in the aftermath of this pandemic. The outcomes of this project will include: 1) characterizations of the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has on mental wellness and stress levels of various engineering student populations; 2) characterizations of coping strategies being used by students during the pandemic; 3) student reactions, positive and negative, to how their home institution handled the COVID-19 pandemic and any related changes in course delivery and university operations.<br/> <br/>The goal of this project is to study the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the academy?s response to it on mental health and baseline stress levels in engineering students from all backgrounds. The specific research aims are: 1) to determine how the conditions imposed by COVID-19 are affecting student baseline stress levels and mental wellness, and 2) to characterize student beliefs surrounding how well their institution has handled the COVID-19 outbreak, student coping strategies, and what students wish their institutions had done differently. Both aims will be accomplished through a nationwide survey targeting engineering students. Mental health and stress level will be measured with a compilation of validated instruments. The second aim will be accomplished through qualitative analysis of responses to a number of open-ended questions about student opinions and beliefs. This study is significant because it will be the first effort to assess the effects of pandemics and other large-scale emergencies on engineering students? mental health and well-being, and will help inform how universities support returning students and handle such crises in the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

579	Amy Grack Nelson	Minnesota Public Radio	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Addressing Families? Covid-19 Information and Education Needs Through Podcast Media	Education and Human Resources - This RAPID was submitted in response to the NSF Dear Colleague letter related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This award is made by the AISL program in the Division of Research on Learning, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The goal of this award is to advance understanding of how children?s science podcasts can provide families with information to help ease children?s anxiety and fears during a pandemic. The project?s hypothesis is that through listening to Brains On! coronavirus-related episodes, children will increase their understanding of science concepts related to the pandemic. As they gain this understanding, it is predicted that their overall fear and anxiety about the pandemic will diminish, they will feel empowered to ask pandemic-related questions and will engage in more science- based conversations with their family members. The project will develop three Brains On! podcast episodes focused specifically on the COVID-19 pandemic for kids aged 5 to 12 and their families. The research questions include:<br/><br/>1. How and to what extent do Brains On!?s coronavirus-based episodes help children and their families understand and talk about science-related pandemic topics? <br/>What kind of conversations are sparked by these episodes?<br/>2. What kinds of questions do children have after listening to the Brains On! coronavirus episodes and what are the reasons for their questions? What can the questions tell us about the impact of listening on kids' science engagement and learning?<br/>3. What resources do parents need to answer children?s questions and help them understand science topics related to the pandemic?<br/><br/>This project is a collaboration between a media producer, Minnesota Public Radio and researchers at The Science Museum of Minnesota. Brains On! already has a large listening audience, with 7 million downloads a year, and more than 200,000 unique listeners a month and these new episodes are likely to increase listenership further. The research findings will be quickly disseminated to a wide range of audiences that can immediately apply the findings to create media and other coronavirus-related educational resources for families. <br/><br/>The PI's prior NSF funded projects have found that previous Brains On! podcasts with a range of STEM content increase the number and sophistication of the science questions children ask and lead to science-based conversations with family members. This project will study the impacts in relation to a singular topic, COVID-19. Three online surveys of Brains On! listeners (families with children ages 5 - 12 years old) will be conducted. The first survey to be conducted as soon as the project begins will focus on parents reflecting on what information is needed at that stage of the pandemic. Two additional listener surveys will occur immediately after new COVID-19 podcast episodes are released. These surveys will ask content-specific questions to understand how well the episode conveys that information to children and their families, what conversations were sparked from the content, and what additional information needs families have. Prior to administering each of the three surveys, video-based think-aloud interviews with 10 families will test and revise survey questions.<br/><br/>Survey participants will be recruited using language in Brains On! episodes, social media, website, and newsletters. A sample size of around 1,000 for each of the surveys is planned (based on a 95% confidence interval and ±3% sampling error). Analyses will include descriptive statistics and thematic coding of open-ended survey questions. Subgroup samples, when large enough will look at differences in responses by demographic variables (e.g. race/ethnicity, household income, highest level of education in the household, an adult in the household with a STEM career, gender of child, geographic location). The researchers and Brains On! staff will work together to identify how the findings can be applied to the development of subsequent coronavirus-related episodes and shared with the ISE field to further support families? education and information needs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

The sensing method is designed to enable differentiation of infectious virus from those rendered non-infectious, as well as other viruses and interfering species. Rapid and accurate detection of the infectious viruses provides to patients the opportunity to receive proper treatments early on, prevents patients from unknowingly spreading the infectious virus to others, eliminates unnecessary quarantine of non-contagious patients, and enables assessment of whether surfaces at critical locations has been properly disinfected. <br/><br/>This research aims to develop a modular and scalable aptamer-nanopore sensor for direct detection of the intact coronavirus. Specifically, this research will identify and synthesize DNA aptamers that bind the infectious SARS-CoV-2, but not the non-infectious forms, with high specificity and affinity. Detection of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in the single nanochannel membrane will be performed using steady-state measurements, which is less resource intensive than the commonly used resistive pulse sensing technique. The sensing method does not require sample pre-treatment or RNA amplification and, thus, simplifies the testing procedure and minimizes the chance of cross contamination.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

581	Howard Stone	Princeton University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Flow Asymmetry in Human Breathing and the Asymptomatic Spreader	Engineering - Aerosol transport of viruses during breathing and speaking, as is common during social interactions of people, is largely unstudied. There is significant recent evidence that the fluid dynamics behind these flows may play a significant role in the spread of Covid-19. The rapid spread of Covid-19 highlights the lack of effective guidelines and mitigation strategies for reducing the impact of a contagious virus in the absence of a vaccine. Recent evidence from hospitals, and even the press, suggests that the fluid dynamics of this transport pathway should be re-investigated. The focus of this research will be to quantify the complex flows associated with speech and breathing during a conversation or nearby encounter and show how transmission of particles between individuals occurs. The understanding gained from this work will provide actionable mitigation strategies to reduce transmission from asymptomatic people. These outcomes can be useful in the short term by offering routes to reducing potential viral transport and future infections.<br/><br/>This research will show how the inherent structural flow difference between exhalation and inhalation during speech or simple breathing could be a potent yet unsuspected transport mechanism for pathogen transmission. The results will quantify an important aspect of this transmission, which in the case of Covid-19 is associated with asymptomatic carriers during relatively close social interactions. The quantitative characterization of this important topic surrounding viral transmission has largely been absent from the fluid mechanics and transport phenomena literatures, and even absent more generally from quantitative studies of public health. Using flow visualization and numerical simulations, the investigation will decipher the fluid dynamics in the neighborhood of the head of an individual during breathing and speaking, and the corresponding environmental mixing important to potential transmission (inhalation of particles by a nearby person). This approach will allow quantifying the fraction of particles exhaled by one person that are inhaled by a nearby person as a function of their separation distance. In these ways, the research will shed new light on a simple yet fundamental mechanism of transport associated with simple human activities, i.e., breathing and speaking, which can be generalized to many pathogens and aid in the identification of potential mitigation strategies for disease transmission by aerosols.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

582	Fumiko Hoeft	Haskins Laboratories, Inc.	None	2020-04-15	2021-03-31	RAPID: Assessing and preventing detrimental impacts on literacy acquisition during COVID-19-related school closures	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - The COVID-19 pandemic has led to shelter-in-place and school closure in the majority of states across the U.S. Most schools are expected to be closed throughout the remaining school year, which will result in students not receiving in-person academic instruction continuously for approximately 6 months. This unprecedented closure will have profound impacts on the development of basic reading skills in the early grades, especially for those children in special education or at-risk for learning disorders where remote/online learning is more challenging. Indeed, extended periods without direct instruction, even in a typical 3-month summer vacation period can result in students losing the equivalent of one month of academic performance. A failure to support learning over the twice as long, COVID-19 closures could have dramatic educational implications. Thus, it is crucial to ask 1) Can remote-learning tools based in current research on reading strengthen key reading-related skills in the youngest learners? 2) What aspects of learning to read are amenable to remote technology? 3) Can digital technology that incorporates cutting-edge reading research in a game-based format overcome the decline in reading skills over the unprecedented length of the COVID-19 school closures?<br/><br/>One hundred educators across the U.S. and 2000 of their K-2 students, all prevented from in-person instruction as a result of COVID-19, will be enrolled in the project. Teachers will incorporate a research-supported, affordable, and technology-based reading instructional program that can be administered in the home to support the development of essential phonological and letter-sound decoding skills with instructional content identical to evidence-based reading instruction in the classroom. Children will be encouraged to play the games at home for 20 minutes per day, 5 days per week, for 12 weeks, proctored by teachers during instructional time. Standardized online reading tests will also be administered several times during the COVID-19 school closures. The research will examine critical factors that moderate reading gains with training, including onset of the training (relative to school closing), duration/intensity of practice, and individual differences in component skills at onset of the study. The research will also assess whether educational technology can serve to prevent closure-related deterioration in reading development by comparing pre- and post-testing for these children with comparable populations not enrolled in the study. Results from this investigation will allow researchers to assess factors that lead to successful learning through educational technology with minimal in-person guidance, which may guide future development and refinement of these remote learning tools. Further, the study is significant as it will not only assess the detrimental impact of COVID-19 school closures on learning to read but also provide direct means to potentially support educators and students who are in dire need of evidence-based remote instructional tools. Such knowledge can be helpful in possible future closures and can provide evidence-based guidance on how to teach students in remote areas within the U.S. where trained reading specialists are not readily available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

583	Yun Shen	University of California-Riverside	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Collaborative Research: Electrospun Nanofibrous Air Filters for Coronavirus Control	Engineering - A collaborative team consisting of researchers from The George Washington University and the University of California, Riverside is developing electrospun nanofibrous air filters for controlling the transmission of coronavirus, including SARS-CoV-2. The pandemic of COVID-19 has raised a significant public health concern in 2020. The spread of COVID-19 is difficult to control, because SARS-CoV-2 is environmentally persistent and it can potentially be suspended in aerosols for long-range, airborne transmission and infection. Air filtration is crucial to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission, however most air filters used in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings are not effective for retaining viruses. As personal protective equipment for healthcare personnel or even the general public, respirators and masks that can effectively capture the virus are also urgently needed for this pandemic. Electrospinning has emerged as a novel technology to synthesize non-woven nanofibrous mats, and it is both industrially viable for large-scale manufacturing and deployable onsite for small-scale applications by a portable device. The fabricated nanofibrous mats are ideal for air filtration, because they have a reduced pore size to efficiently capture the virus, a large porosity to reduce air pressure drop in filtration, well-controlled properties, and mechanical robustness and flexibility. This RAPID research project will rationally design and fabricate novel nanomaterial-based air filters for coronavirus control, understand the interplay between viral pathogens and nanomaterials in complex environmental matrices, and initiate a fast response for protecting the public health with engineering tools. The project will provide training to students in science and engineering areas and offer them hands-on research experience, and introduce students from diverse backgrounds and educational levels, particularly those from underrepresented groups, to cutting-edge research in STEM. In addition, the project will disseminate the acquired knowledge through education modules, scientific journals and conferences, and science fairs, which will help increase the scientific literacy of the general public. <br/><br/>The research team aims to rationally design and fabricate electrospun nanofibrous air filters that are effective, low-cost, scalable, and easy for implementation for coronavirus control, including SARS-CoV-2, and to understand the mechanism of coronavirus removal in air filtration. The researchers will first develop electrospun nanofibrous air filters with diverse morphologies, retained charges, and selective binding sites to enhance the capture of bioaerosols containing coronavirus. Coronavirus removal efficiency under different environmental conditions will next be evaluated to understand the performance and robustness of the air filters. Key virus-nanomaterial interactions will be identified with the aid of both simulation and experimental tools, which can guide future air filter design and optimization. For this RAPID project, the researchers will also test the performance of air filters for removing SARS-CoV-2 in a healthcare facility that houses COVID-19 patients. The proposed research will contribute significantly to nanotechnology, microbiology, and environmental engineering, and it can be potentially transformative in the field of materials at large in terms of multiscale, rational, functional design. It will not only provide a rapid response to COVID-19 outbreaks and public health protection, but also be translated into controlling other virulent pathogens. The project will provide training to students in STEM, particularly introduce students from underrepresented groups and students from diverse backgrounds and educational levels to cutting-edge research. Moreover, the project will disseminate the acquired knowledge to help increase the scientific literacy of the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

584	Sankaran Thayumanavan	UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: COVID-19 Detection Through Amplification of Protease-Based Signals	Mathematical and Physical Sciences - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the novel coronavirus infectious disease 2019, COVID-19. During a key step in the viral lifecycle, infected human cells release not only virus particles but also enzymes that cut viral and host proteins, called proteases. Detection of the proteases linked to SARS-CoV-2 would provide an alternative path for testing for COVID-19. With this award, the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry is supporting the research of Drs. Sankaran Thayumanavan, Jeanne Hardy, and Trisha L. Andrew at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst to develop "smart" sampling swabs whose color changes when the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 is present. The color change of the swab results when the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 breaks down a colorless, protein-derived molecule into individual pieces, with one of those pieces having its chemical properties changed during the break-down process, so that it absorbs or produces light that can be seen by the human eye. The investigators design and make the protein-derived probe molecules and then incorporate them into the fibers of currently-used clinical swabs. Their chemical design allows the probe molecules to be selectively broken down by the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 and to produce strong color in the smart swabs even when extremely low concentrations of the main protease are present. Creation of the necessary chemical reactions and their application to develop the protease-responsive smart swabs may lead to inexpensive testing methods that are practical for use by individuals at home. Due to the generality of the release of proteases in the lifecycle of viral infections, the new chemical reactions and resulting technologies are anticipated to be useful for visual detection of other viruses, which may be especially meaningful during future potential outbreaks. Educational, training, and outreach activities focus on graduate students working with Drs. Thayumanavan, Hardy, and Andrew in a cross-cutting, team-oriented research environment to address the development of front-line measurement science approaches, with anticipated highlights shared with the public and K-12 students about their experiences and lessons learned about how research funding can be used to directly impact a major societal crisis.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop rapid, accurate, straightforward probe-based sensors that detect the inherent catalytic properties of viral protease enzymes, which produce a clear optical readout. Efforts are focused on creating new sensing chemistries that utilize specifically designed dye-based reporters and using them to develop inexpensive, disposable smart swabs to detect the presence of catalytically-active severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 main protease (CoV2-MP). The general research approach Drs. Thayumanavan, Hardy, and Andrew take is to first generate protease recognition elements by designing, producing, and validating peptides that provide the optimal specificity to the targeted viral protease. The resulting protease recognition elements are then linked to donor-acceptor chromophores to create "pro-chromophoric" probes that remain in a dark (uncolored, discolored, or quenched) state. Upon exposure to the main viral protease, the free reporter is liberated and produces a highly intense colorimetric or fluorescence signal, with the estimated limits of detection offering sensing of sub-picomolar concentrations of CoV2-MP. Sophisticated reporter formulations with integrated chemical amplification routes are predicted to provide access to these limits of detection. Importantly, the protease-based detection strategy and swab test platform are easily and generally transferable for detecting potential future viral pathogens based on their specific protease structures.<br/><br/>This grant is being awarded using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

At this time, the pandemic is being driven by person-to-person transmission of the coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2. The U.S. government, both state and federal, responded to the pandemic by launching social distancing as an intervention, ordering schools and non-essential businesses to close throughout most of the country. Mathematical models are required in order to measure the transmission of COVID-19 in the U.S. This research focuses on building mathematical models that include data on social distancing to measure how effective the intervention is at slowing the disease. The researchers will also evaluate strategies for reopening schools and workplaces. Importantly, the researchers will measure the risk for a second pandemic wave by accounting for how the immune system reacts to the infection. This research is important because it will provide the U.S. government with models that it can use to choose among options for reopening cities. These models will also reveal the number of deaths averted by social distancing policies. In addition to the great societal benefit of this research, it also brings scientific advancement and broader impacts by demonstrating how novel datasets can be collected in real-time and models can be deployed during a public health emergency. This project provides professional development opportunities for an early career scientist. <br/><br/>Transmission models will be used to explore creative ways for phased reopening of cities in order to minimize disease-induced mortality and overburdening of hospitals. The researchers will focus on the 62 counties in New York state, the current epicenter of the pandemic. The researchers will fit a city-level COVID-19 transmission model which accounts for social distancing quantified by Google traffic data, and ground-truthed by public transportation data, live-webcam streams, and Google trends indicating individuals are staying home. The researchers will explore transmission dynamics and hospitalization trajectories under different scenarios of adaptive immunity (e.g., long-lived sterilizing immunity, waning immunity, and immunity that reduces symptoms in subsequent infections). Models will be parameterized using data on testing, COVID-19 clinical cases, hospitalizations, and mortality via Maximum Likelihood by Iterated Particle Filtering (MIF). Modeling will be done in real time, requiring the statistical inference pipeline to be sufficiently nimble to account for the rapidly changing epidemiological situation. The researchers are interfacing with policy makers as part of CDC working groups on modeling COVID-19 and will actively share data through the NIH MIDAS coordination network.<br/><br/>This RAPID award is made by the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases Program in the Division of Environmental Biology, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Since there is currently no medication to treat COVID-19, the most challenging question is how to effectively allocate constrained healthcare resources to the next potential outburst communities or areas, so that we can halt or even prevent the virus' further spreading. The current reactive efforts of relying on people to visit their doctors or testing stations for collecting infection data may not work in an efficient and timely manner due to the limited coverage, high cost, and increased exposure risk for people to be congested at those places. This project develops a fine-grained and location privacy-preserving COVID19 symptom map (CSM) via mobile crowdsourcing, where the symptoms may include fever, cough, or shortness of breath. The proposed CSM is promising in its ability to identify the potential outbreak areas and facilitate the proactive and dynamic allocation of healthcare resources. Meanwhile, the location privacy preserving feature will protect the mobile crowdsourcing participants from bias or discrimination, encouraging them to participate for the public good. The project involves synergized efforts from mobile crowdsourcing, public health science, data analytics, privacy, and social science. Education and outreach activities are designed to increase the participation of women and minority in science and engineering.<br/><br/>This project develops an interdisciplinary framework for location privacy preservation, mobile crowdsourcing, data analytics, social science, and public health science, and contains a research plan with four interconnected thrusts. First, a novel location differential privacy preservation mechanism named differentially private hexagonal hierarchical geospatial indexing system (DPH3) will be developed, which can well represent physical community structure in the map, guarantee mobile crowdsourcing participants? location differential privacy, and provide high mobile crowdsourcing utility for CSM construction in terms of map coverage and accuracy. Second, a coverage-aware crowdsourcing participant recruitment scheme based on DPH3 and approximation algorithm will be designed to guarantee the crowdsensing coverage while preserving participants' location differential privacy. Third, a quality-assured CSM will be constructed by using virus propagation model as the prior knowledge for detrending in ordinary kriging and robust estimation for mitigating the impact of location privacy preserving noises added by DPH3. Fourth, a strategic communication approach to community engagement from the perspective of social science will be used to motivate community members? activeness in information seeking and sharing about COVID-19 symptoms, facilitate crowdsourcing needed for the CSM, as well as empower the community members.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

This award to the University of Georgia will leverage bioinformatics tools to identify virulence genes that assisted SARS-COV-2 in jumping species boundaries. Identifying shared genetic changes between human SARS-COV-2 and its relatives in mammalian reservoirs in the bat, pangolin, and civit is important to understanding the virus mode of action. It is especially critical to identify which of the changes contribute to human virulence of SARS-COV-2. The researchers will analyze 3200+ genomes from SARS-COV-2 and coronavirus genomes from animal reservoirs to look at genetic changes associated with virulence and COVID-19 symptoms. To accomplish this work, new software tools will be developed to better leverage modern computer graphics processing units (GPUs) for high-speed parallel computing. The project will engage graduate students and REU participants in interdisciplinary research of critical national importance and contribute useful tools for future bioinformatic research.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to identify virulence genes that enable SARS-COV-2 to jump species boundaries from vertebrate reservoirs. The project has three main components: (1) building gene trees within species trees of coronavirus by coalescent methods; (2) testing for shared polymorphisms under selective sweep between natural reservoirs and human SARS-COV-2; (3) validating candidates identified in task (2) independently by comparing gene genealogies for selective sweep (under selection for virulence) vs. incomplete lineage sorting. An interdisciplinary team from genetics, bioinformatics, and infectious diseases will develop gene trees within a species tree of 3,200+ published SARS-COV-2 genomes using a novel BEST coalescent method developed for GPUs. Results from these studies will be rapidly disseminated and published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at scientific conferences, and made available through shared software repositories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

588	Natalia Trayanova	Johns Hopkins University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Prediction of Cardiac Dysfunction in COVID-19 Patients Using Machine Learning	Engineering - Recent reports demonstrate the critical influence of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system, with up to 20% of COVID-19 patients suffering acute cardiac injury. Approaches to identify COVID-19 patients at risk for cardiac dysfunction have not yet been developed, and no alerting clinical parameters are available to address the impending decline of cardiac function and mortality. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning approach to identify COVID-19 patients at risk for cardiac dysfunction and sudden cardiac death. Utilizing such an approach will provide early warning and enable the delivery of early goal-directed therapy, reducing mortality and optimizing allocation of resources. The machine learning classifier is to be distributed to any interested healthcare institution, to augment their ability to successfully treat patients. This project also provides fundamental new scientific knowledge: how COVID-19-related cardiac injury could result in cardiac dysfunction and sudden cardiac death. Such knowledge is of paramount importance in the fight against COVID-19 and the post-disease adverse effects on human health. <br/><br/>Features that will serve as input into the machine learning classifier will be extracted from both time series (ECG, cardiac-specific laboratory values, continuously-obtained vital signs) and imaging data (CT, echocardiography). Data will be collected from patients admitted to Johns Hopkins Hospital and Johns Hopkins Health System; other hospitals in the Chesapeake area; and potetially hospitals in NYC, with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 based on nucleic acid or polymerase chain reaction testing. We will develop a time-varying risk score that will determine the posterior probability of hemodynamically-significant cardiac disease outcome within 24 hours of certain time points. For new patients, the model will be used to perform a baseline prediction which will be updated in a Bayesian fashion each time new data becomes available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

589	Bradley Olsen	Massachusetts Institute of Technology	None	2020-07-01	2021-06-30	RAPID: Collaborative Research: Augmenting Mucosal Gels with Associating Brush Polymers to Prevent COVID-19 Infection	Mathematical and Physical Sciences - The SARS-CoV-2 causes the novel coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19). A key challenge with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is developing protective countermeasures that can slow the spread of the disease. With funding from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Professors Stephen L. Craig and Michael Rubinstein of Duke University and Bradley D. Olsen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are developing macromolecules for use as inhaled countermeasures to reduce the rate of infection with SARS-CoV-2. Mucus clearance is an essential defense mechanism in mammalian lungs. It is used to capture and clear inhaled infectious agents, such as SARS-CoV-2 virus, from airway surfaces. The team prepares macromolecules or polymers consisting of many repeating units linked with covalent bonds. These large molecules are constructed in order to mimic properties of mucins in the human body. Additionally, the synthetic mucin mimics are tagged with binders that are specific for SARS-CoV-2. The prepared mucus-mimicking polymers are designed to blend efficiently with natural mucus in the body once introduced. This allows the polymers to act as effective decoys that bind to viral receptors in SARS-CoV-2. As a result, the pathways by which the virus enters the lungs and infects cells are blocked. Apart from synthetic chemistry, computational modelling is also used in this research to guide and speed up experimental design. Scientific advances associated with this research could be particularly useful for health care workers who are exposed to a heavy dose of SARS-CoV-2, but may also be scaled to the civilian population. The project also contributes to the training of postdoctoral students in a highly interdisciplinary research environment.<br/><br/>The research team is developing an inhaled polymeric countermeasure that will reinforce mucosal layers, enabling individuals to demonstrate a substantially decreased rate of infection from SARS-CoV-2 after exposure or to tolerate a larger dose without developing severe symptoms. In the first project goal, new bottlebrush polymers functionalized with readily available luteolin-, quercetin- and cepharantine-based binders for SARS-CoV-2 are synthesized using ruthenium catalyzed ring opening metathesis polymerization. Systematic studies are then conducted to explore how the ligand and polymer design affect their multi-virus binding using both theory and experiment. The second goal focuses on understanding how mucin-mimetic bottlebrush polymers incorporate into supramolecular networks formed by native mucins and how they can maintain key mechanistic properties of these natural systems while reducing viral penetration. The probability of association, network formation, microphase separation, and macroscopic phase separation is predicted using modified molecular models. Cell sheet testing is used to quantify the impact of the mucin-mimetic polymers on infectivity. This research has the potential to advance the design of bottlebrush polymers by expanding new ligand conjugation schemes that enable SARS-CoV-2-specific ligands to be attached to bottlebrush polymers. Novel methods of theory and simulation are also developed for both viral diffusion and blends of synthetic bottlebrushes and natural mucins, which could be applicable to other biological systems.<br/><br/>This grant is being awarded using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

590	Chelsea LeNoble	Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	RAPID: Collaborative Proposal: Effects of Institutional Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic on Undergraduate Faculty and Students Across STEM Disciplines	Education and Human Resources - The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in unprecedented, nation-wide disruption of academic institutions. As a result, there is an urgent need to understand the acute effects of this disruption on undergraduate STEM education in the U.S. This project will examine experiences of faculty and students resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent institutional changes. Initiated during a time of uncertainty, this project will: (1) capture the ephemeral nature of undergraduate education experiences before national recovery milestones are achieved; and (2) inform efforts to adapt undergraduate STEM education during crises. The project team will collect data about institutional characteristics and crisis communication messages, as well as about experiences of individual faculty and students. These data will be analyzed to identify pathways through which the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced teaching and learning within undergraduate STEM education. The findings of this project will be used to develop actionable recommendations for institutions of higher education, including crisis communication strategies, guidelines for pedagogy in times of crisis, and checklists of resources. As the STEM workforce plays a critical role in the economic health of the U.S. in normal and disaster situations, this effort to rapidly collect data and learn from this situation will contribute to the security and well-being of society. It is expected that the results will also support a more resilient, globally competitive next generation of STEM workers. <br/><br/>The project?s specific aims are to: (1) examine teaching and learning experiences of undergraduate faculty and students in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) examine the effects of faculty and student reactions on undergraduate STEM teaching and learning; and (3) leverage findings to develop actionable recommendations for colleges and universities to best prepare and protect their faculty, staff, and students and the integrity of undergraduate STEM education. The goal of these activities is to answer key research questions: How do institutions? COVID-19 policies influence faculty and student attitudes, perceptions, and behavior related to STEM teaching and learning? What teaching and learning resources were most important for undergraduate STEM faculty and students? How do these effects on undergraduate STEM education develop over time? Given the rapidly changing nature of the situation, individual-level data that are needed to answer the research questions are inherently ephemeral. Faculty and students are unlikely to accurately later recall the extent to which they were able to adapt to changes, the extent to which changes created distress, and how they coped with events. Using the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, faculty and students from a stratified random sample of representative institutions will be recruited to participate in an online survey and semi-structured interviews conducted across three time points. Grounded in the research literatures of crisis communication, organizational science, and disaster management, this project addresses gaps in undergraduate STEM education research related to faculty and student reactions to disruptive contexts, characteristics of institutions that make them resilient toward disruptive contexts, and institutional learning from disruptive contexts. The findings will be disseminated to institutions of higher education and through a public web site relating to the resources most critical for fostering resilience among faculty and staff when adapting to a disrupted educational context. In addition, participating institutions and individuals will receive customized reports and resources. By evaluating the immediate impact of COVID-19, this project aims to enhance the undergraduate education infrastructure, improve the delivery of STEM education during and after disruptions, and help to protect the well-being of faculty and students collectively experiencing this crisis.

This information is needed to understand how the current SARS-CoV-2 virus spread to humans and to identify potential host animals (e.g., pet, livestock, and pest species) that may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 in the USA. SARS-CoV-2, the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic, can infect diverse species of animals. There is a variation in susceptibility to and severity of disease between species. This variation suggests that some species have genetic differences that dictate susceptibility to COVID-19. This work will identify how coronaviruses adapt to new host species, information that will help predict and control future coronavirus outbreaks. Funding will support training a graduate student in research, thereby training the next generation of the bioeconomy workforce. <br/><br/>This project will investigate how the host genome shapes host-pathogen interactions, and how coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2 evolve to exploit new hosts. The researchers will compare existing genomic data for hundreds of mammals using three complementary approaches: (1) Measure structural and sequence homology in two host proteins, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, necessary for infection in humans; (2) Analyze existing RNA-seq datasets to (a) identify species with co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and potentially other proteases implicated in infection, in the same tissue, and (b) search for incidental coronaviral sequence data from diverse mammalian species; (3) Test for variants in evolutionarily conserved elements that are correlated with species susceptibility, using forward genomics. With these analyses, the researchers will identify species with potential as reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2 viral spillback into humans, and those that are promising systems for investigating SARS-CoV-2 evolution, host defenses, and host-pathogen interactions.

Data are leveraged from several hundred respondents? daily time use before the pandemic along with data collected during and after the pandemic to create a natural experiment that isolates the effects of the pandemic on changes in behavior. Among the products of this research are evidence-based recommendations to address the social consequences of the pandemic.<br/><br/>This project collects data for the second and third waves of a three-wave panel study, the second wave during the pandemic with shelter-at-home and lockdown orders in place and the third wave after the pandemic has subsided and orders have been relaxed. Data for these two waves consist of survey responses and 24-hour time diaries collected from 2,000 respondents from online crowdsourcing platforms. This sample includes a smaller sample from whom data were collected before the pandemic.

Specific research problems to be addressed include (1) Making reliable predictions for the state of the pandemic in the next few days/weeks/months. (2) Estimating the effect of governmental measures in the dynamics of the pandemic. (3) Designing protocols for effective control of a pandemic to prevent overloading the healthcare system. Efficient management of large-scale epidemics that are likely to overwhelm the health care system on a national scale, which would surely lead to a significant increase in the loss of human lives, including deaths not related to the specific pathogen causing the epidemic. <br/><br/>This project will make contributions to the fundamental research on developing actionable models for epidemic estimation and control. Specifically, the focus is on models that are amenable to (i) the estimation of model parameters, (ii) the estimation of the state of the epidemic, and (iii) computing optimal intervention policies; all three with high degrees of confidence based on the relatively small datasets that are available while an epidemic is evolving. The research includes data-driven techniques to determine the impact of non-pharmaceutical social measures for epidemic management. A key challenge in this area is to reliably infer causal relationships between social measures and their effect in the epidemic dynamics. Methods will be developed to determine intervention policies that minimize the loss of human life and economic impact, without overwhelming the healthcare system. The existence of delays from actuation (e.g., through social measures) to effects (e.g., in changes of infection rates) and the large uncertainty in the actuation mechanisms pose significant technical challenges that must be addressed through robust decision policies. This project will also provide training opportunities for students in the areas of system modeling, identification, and control.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

595	Daniel Preston	William Marsh Rice University	None	2020-06-01	2021-05-31	Collaborative Proposal: RAPID: Thermal Sterilization of Personal Protective Equipment Contaminated with SARS-CoV-2	Engineering - As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread, medical workers in the United States face a dire shortage of personal protective equipment, including masks, face shields, and gowns. As a result, many doctors and nurses are reusing personal protective equipment intended to be discarded after a single use and thereby increasing their risk of contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. These medical workers, and also the general public, urgently need reliable guidelines for sterilization of personal protective equipment to enable safe reuse. Dry heat sterilization can be performed almost anywhere (including home ovens and rice cookers), and viruses inside of crevices or within fabrics are easily inactivated; this project will provide evidence-based guidelines for the time required to achieve sterilization at a given temperature. The project will also enable prediction of the lifetime of human coronaviruses across various climates, which will be of extreme importance to epidemiologists in predicting the spread of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the severity of a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic that may accompany the return of colder weather this upcoming autumn and winter.<br/><br/>This collaborative research project will produce a thermodynamic model that combines a framework built on the Arrhenius equation and the rate law with both existing and forthcoming experimental data to accurately describe the thermal inactivation time of SARS-CoV-2. The proposed thermodynamic model will treat viruses as large molecules that undergo thermal denaturation and will be used to predict inactivation times for viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, by incorporating physical properties of each virus as inputs to determine the dependence of viral inactivation rate on temperature and other environmental conditions. The project will aim to achieve three objectives, namely: (1) to model the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 due to thermal degradation, including the effects of humidity, pH, surface material, and other conditions in addition to temperature; (2) to experimentally demonstrate sterilization due to thermal inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 on medical personal protective equipment and refine the thermodynamic model by incorporating data from these experimental results; and (3) to characterize thermal degradation of personal protective equipment during repeated thermal sterilization cycles. This work will lead to an unprecedented fundamental understanding of the thermal inactivation of viruses that will help fight the current COVID-19 pandemic and provide the basis for modeling viruses that cause future outbreaks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

The work will result in concrete approaches for quantifying uncertainty of possible outcomes and provide reliable tools to assist decision makers in designing mitigation strategies for the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, a new statistical inference tool will be developed to estimate the key epidemic parameters that describe the nature of the COVID-19 spread in an interpretable manner. These parameters are critical for providing reliable forecasts through real-time simulation of potential outbreaks. The new models will analyze the effects of changing social contact structures on the spread of COVID-19, and account for missing or partial data in a systematic way. The results of this project will contribute to the scientific and mathematical approaches needed to provide effective and quick understanding of future epidemics or relevant phenomena.<br/><br/>Existing epidemic models largely rely on deterministic systems that are unable to quantify the uncertainty critical for decision making. In addition, data analysis and predictive modeling for the COVID-19 pandemic require statistical tools for fitting epidemic models with only partially available data. However, most stochastic models face challenges in the face of missing data. To address this gap, the project team will develop new stochastic compartmental models that extend classical approaches to explicitly account for changes to the social contact network underlying the disease spread. These new developments will be accompanied by likelihood-based methods to infer key epidemic parameters that offer mechanistic interpretations with uncertainty quantification. In particular, missing data such as infection times at the individual level will be accounted for via novel data augmentation techniques. The results of this project will provide guidance both to the scientific community on how to evaluate the COVID-19 pandemic, and to the general public on which mitigation strategies would be most effective.<br/><br/>This grant is being awarded using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

597	Juyeong Choi	Florida State University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: The Impact of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic on Municipal Solid Waste Management Systems	Engineering - The coronavirus pandemic is challenging municipal solid waste management systems (MSWMSs). In an effort to prevent its spread, most people are working from home, which means that they are generating a larger amount of residential waste than normal. Further, the capacity of MSWMSs is being constrained by the increasing number of unavailable workers due to self-quarantining and the isolation of local areas as a result of travel bans. With a pandemic, the function and interplay of different system components (i.e., waste collection companies, waste transfer stations, local government agencies, material recovery facilities, and landfills) must become more adaptive to maximize the limited capacity, which is key to accommodating excessive waste demand. In this RAPID project, the project team will collect ephemeral data on the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on MSWMSs in multiple U.S. states including Florida, New York, and California. Since the impact of the coronavirus on MSWMSs and their responses vary across states and from urban to rural setting, these data can be used to (i) identify and characterize a broad range of regional waste management challenges, (ii) track the emerging adaptive behaviors different system entities take to adequately operate municipal waste services, and (iii) specify the system requirements and characteristics (i.e., system composition, topology, and control) that enable successful adaptation during a pandemic. This project will yield a database of pandemic impacts and responses and associated attributes and variables in MSWMSs that will guide researchers, private sectors, regulators, and planning agencies toward the creation and implementation of resilient waste management operations for pandemics. <br/><br/>The primary project tasks are threefold. First, the team will identify and map entities, operations, relationships, and controls in each system through virtual meetings with waste management companies and solid waste management authorities, and review of waste management guidelines. This step will establish a baseline structure for the normal operation, which will help to distinguish entities' emerging behaviors during the pandemic. Second, an online survey will ask system entities about their waste-related challenges and responses; the survey will occur once per month over a six-month period. If normal operations require adaptation of system structure, an interview will be held to gain more insight into the collective decision-making context. Third, a virtual workshop with a technical advisory group will be organized at the end of this project to review MSWMSs' reported adaptive measures and discuss recommendations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Current methods for detecting the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 typically require a laboratory and use expensive equipment and reagents. These requirements limit the number of tests that can be performed nationwide. In this project, the research team aims to develop an alternative diagnostic approach that directly detects the viral RNA without any amplification, labeling, or the use of enzymes. The assay requires minimal steps and uses a compact, bufferless gel cartridge system that can be deployed in a clinical setting. Beyond the current COVID-19 outbreak, this sensing platform can also apply to other existing or emerging viruses.<br/><br/>This work aims to develop a nanoswitch assay sensitive enough to detect clinical levels of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA within 1 hour. Once the viral RNA is extracted from a sample, the RNA is fragmented and mixed with the DNA-based nanoswitches. Hybridization of a viral RNA fragment of a specific sequence with a nanoswitch induces a conformational change of the engineered DNA strand from its linear "off" state to a looped "on" state. After separation of the target-bound looped form from the linear nanoswitches by electrophoresis in a gel cartridge system, the viral load is quantified from the intensity of the looped (on) nanoswitches in a gel image.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

599	Arshad Kudrolli	Clark University	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	RAPID: Predicting Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Impact with Multiscale Contact and Transmission Mitigation	Mathematical and Physical Sciences - Nontechnical Abstract: <br/>The rapid spread of new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes Coronavirus Disease (covid-19), requires a multidisciplinary mitigation strategy from the clinical to physical host-to-host transmission modelling. Data is required on the transmission of pathogen carrying airborne mucosalivary droplets and aerosols generated during normal breathing, talking, sneezing, and coughing. Synthetic exhalations will be measured leveraging advanced prototyping to obtain data needed to model the spread of covid-19, and the efficacy of personal protection devices and face coverings fabricated with various weaves and materials will be tested. Physical data related to temperature, humidity, and airflow on survival and dispersion of exhalations will be obtained. The data will be integrated using supervised machine learning methods, mathematical network simulations, and epidemiological data to develop an individual-based method that can give pandemic management results. Physical data will be published on transmission rates, including wearing of personal protective equipment and face coverings with various weaves, to inform mitigation strategies to alleviate covid-19 pandemic. Interactive Web based resources will be used for immediate broad dissemination of data and learning outcomes on covid-19 to the public, in addition to peer reviewed publications and training post-doctoral and undergraduate researchers in methods leading to pandemic mitigation.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The mode of transmission and extent of environmental contaminations on the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (covid-19), while sharing features with severe acute respiratory syndrome and other infectious diseases, remains unknown. This project will address fundamental rheology-matched metrics of transport and survival of airborne exhalation droplets and aerosols that carry coronavirus and on surfaces needed as input parameters for modeling mitigation. Impact of personal protective equipment on individual prognosis, with physical data related to temperature, humidity, and airflow-dependent dispersion distance of pathogen bearing viscoelastic droplets corresponding to breathing, sneezing, and coughing, will be obtained. The impact of the measured transmission rates on the spread and recurrence will be investigated with epidemiological data integrated with deep learning to implement a scalable, individual-based, stochastic, spatial model. Resulting peer-reviewed publications will serve as trusted source for calculation of covid-19 transmissibility and personal protection strategies. Post-doctoral and undergraduate researchers versed in fluid dynamics, soft matter physics, and network simulations will be trained toward mitigating infectious disease spread.<br/><br/>This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) grant supports research that will result in spatiotemporal mucosalivary droplet transmission range data required to develop covid-19 mitigation network methods with funding from the CARES Act managed by the Condensed Matter Physics Program in the Division of Materials Research of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

600	Yun Shen	University of California-Riverside	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Collaborative Research: Electrospun Nanofibrous Air Filters for Coronavirus Control	Engineering - A collaborative team consisting of researchers from The George Washington University and the University of California, Riverside is developing electrospun nanofibrous air filters for controlling the transmission of coronavirus, including SARS-CoV-2. The pandemic of COVID-19 has raised a significant public health concern in 2020. The spread of COVID-19 is difficult to control, because SARS-CoV-2 is environmentally persistent and it can potentially be suspended in aerosols for long-range, airborne transmission and infection. Air filtration is crucial to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission, however most air filters used in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings are not effective for retaining viruses. As personal protective equipment for healthcare personnel or even the general public, respirators and masks that can effectively capture the virus are also urgently needed for this pandemic. Electrospinning has emerged as a novel technology to synthesize non-woven nanofibrous mats, and it is both industrially viable for large-scale manufacturing and deployable onsite for small-scale applications by a portable device. The fabricated nanofibrous mats are ideal for air filtration, because they have a reduced pore size to efficiently capture the virus, a large porosity to reduce air pressure drop in filtration, well-controlled properties, and mechanical robustness and flexibility. This RAPID research project will rationally design and fabricate novel nanomaterial-based air filters for coronavirus control, understand the interplay between viral pathogens and nanomaterials in complex environmental matrices, and initiate a fast response for protecting the public health with engineering tools. The project will provide training to students in science and engineering areas and offer them hands-on research experience, and introduce students from diverse backgrounds and educational levels, particularly those from underrepresented groups, to cutting-edge research in STEM. In addition, the project will disseminate the acquired knowledge through education modules, scientific journals and conferences, and science fairs, which will help increase the scientific literacy of the general public. <br/><br/>The research team aims to rationally design and fabricate electrospun nanofibrous air filters that are effective, low-cost, scalable, and easy for implementation for coronavirus control, including SARS-CoV-2, and to understand the mechanism of coronavirus removal in air filtration. The researchers will first develop electrospun nanofibrous air filters with diverse morphologies, retained charges, and selective binding sites to enhance the capture of bioaerosols containing coronavirus. Coronavirus removal efficiency under different environmental conditions will next be evaluated to understand the performance and robustness of the air filters. Key virus-nanomaterial interactions will be identified with the aid of both simulation and experimental tools, which can guide future air filter design and optimization. For this RAPID project, the researchers will also test the performance of air filters for removing SARS-CoV-2 in a healthcare facility that houses COVID-19 patients. The proposed research will contribute significantly to nanotechnology, microbiology, and environmental engineering, and it can be potentially transformative in the field of materials at large in terms of multiscale, rational, functional design. It will not only provide a rapid response to COVID-19 outbreaks and public health protection, but also be translated into controlling other virulent pathogens. The project will provide training to students in STEM, particularly introduce students from underrepresented groups and students from diverse backgrounds and educational levels to cutting-edge research. Moreover, the project will disseminate the acquired knowledge to help increase the scientific literacy of the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

601	Sankaran Thayumanavan	UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: COVID-19 Detection Through Amplification of Protease-Based Signals	Mathematical and Physical Sciences - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the novel coronavirus infectious disease 2019, COVID-19. During a key step in the viral lifecycle, infected human cells release not only virus particles but also enzymes that cut viral and host proteins, called proteases. Detection of the proteases linked to SARS-CoV-2 would provide an alternative path for testing for COVID-19. With this award, the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry is supporting the research of Drs. Sankaran Thayumanavan, Jeanne Hardy, and Trisha L. Andrew at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst to develop "smart" sampling swabs whose color changes when the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 is present. The color change of the swab results when the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 breaks down a colorless, protein-derived molecule into individual pieces, with one of those pieces having its chemical properties changed during the break-down process, so that it absorbs or produces light that can be seen by the human eye. The investigators design and make the protein-derived probe molecules and then incorporate them into the fibers of currently-used clinical swabs. Their chemical design allows the probe molecules to be selectively broken down by the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 and to produce strong color in the smart swabs even when extremely low concentrations of the main protease are present. Creation of the necessary chemical reactions and their application to develop the protease-responsive smart swabs may lead to inexpensive testing methods that are practical for use by individuals at home. Due to the generality of the release of proteases in the lifecycle of viral infections, the new chemical reactions and resulting technologies are anticipated to be useful for visual detection of other viruses, which may be especially meaningful during future potential outbreaks. Educational, training, and outreach activities focus on graduate students working with Drs. Thayumanavan, Hardy, and Andrew in a cross-cutting, team-oriented research environment to address the development of front-line measurement science approaches, with anticipated highlights shared with the public and K-12 students about their experiences and lessons learned about how research funding can be used to directly impact a major societal crisis.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop rapid, accurate, straightforward probe-based sensors that detect the inherent catalytic properties of viral protease enzymes, which produce a clear optical readout. Efforts are focused on creating new sensing chemistries that utilize specifically designed dye-based reporters and using them to develop inexpensive, disposable smart swabs to detect the presence of catalytically-active severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 main protease (CoV2-MP). The general research approach Drs. Thayumanavan, Hardy, and Andrew take is to first generate protease recognition elements by designing, producing, and validating peptides that provide the optimal specificity to the targeted viral protease. The resulting protease recognition elements are then linked to donor-acceptor chromophores to create "pro-chromophoric" probes that remain in a dark (uncolored, discolored, or quenched) state. Upon exposure to the main viral protease, the free reporter is liberated and produces a highly intense colorimetric or fluorescence signal, with the estimated limits of detection offering sensing of sub-picomolar concentrations of CoV2-MP. Sophisticated reporter formulations with integrated chemical amplification routes are predicted to provide access to these limits of detection. Importantly, the protease-based detection strategy and swab test platform are easily and generally transferable for detecting potential future viral pathogens based on their specific protease structures.<br/><br/>This grant is being awarded using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

At this time, the pandemic is being driven by person-to-person transmission of the coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2. The U.S. government, both state and federal, responded to the pandemic by launching social distancing as an intervention, ordering schools and non-essential businesses to close throughout most of the country. Mathematical models are required in order to measure the transmission of COVID-19 in the U.S. This research focuses on building mathematical models that include data on social distancing to measure how effective the intervention is at slowing the disease. The researchers will also evaluate strategies for reopening schools and workplaces. Importantly, the researchers will measure the risk for a second pandemic wave by accounting for how the immune system reacts to the infection. This research is important because it will provide the U.S. government with models that it can use to choose among options for reopening cities. These models will also reveal the number of deaths averted by social distancing policies. In addition to the great societal benefit of this research, it also brings scientific advancement and broader impacts by demonstrating how novel datasets can be collected in real-time and models can be deployed during a public health emergency. This project provides professional development opportunities for an early career scientist. <br/><br/>Transmission models will be used to explore creative ways for phased reopening of cities in order to minimize disease-induced mortality and overburdening of hospitals. The researchers will focus on the 62 counties in New York state, the current epicenter of the pandemic. The researchers will fit a city-level COVID-19 transmission model which accounts for social distancing quantified by Google traffic data, and ground-truthed by public transportation data, live-webcam streams, and Google trends indicating individuals are staying home. The researchers will explore transmission dynamics and hospitalization trajectories under different scenarios of adaptive immunity (e.g., long-lived sterilizing immunity, waning immunity, and immunity that reduces symptoms in subsequent infections). Models will be parameterized using data on testing, COVID-19 clinical cases, hospitalizations, and mortality via Maximum Likelihood by Iterated Particle Filtering (MIF). Modeling will be done in real time, requiring the statistical inference pipeline to be sufficiently nimble to account for the rapidly changing epidemiological situation. The researchers are interfacing with policy makers as part of CDC working groups on modeling COVID-19 and will actively share data through the NIH MIDAS coordination network.<br/><br/>This RAPID award is made by the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases Program in the Division of Environmental Biology, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

603	Miao Pan	University of Houston	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Collaborative: Location Privacy Preserving COVID-19 Symptom Map Construction via Mobile Crowdsourcing for Proactive Constrained Resource Allocation	Computer and Information Science and Engineering - The recent pandemic of COVID-19 has caused a public health crisis to US and many other countries in the world. Since there is currently no medication to treat COVID-19, the most challenging question is how to effectively allocate constrained healthcare resources to the next potential outburst communities or areas, so that we can halt or even prevent the virus' further spreading. The current reactive efforts of relying on people to visit their doctors or testing stations for collecting infection data may not work in an efficient and timely manner due to the limited coverage, high cost, and increased exposure risk for people to be congested at those places. This project develops a fine-grained and location privacy-preserving COVID19 symptom map (CSM) via mobile crowdsourcing, where the symptoms may include fever, cough, or shortness of breath. The proposed CSM is promising in its ability to identify the potential outbreak areas and facilitate the proactive and dynamic allocation of healthcare resources. Meanwhile, the location privacy preserving feature will protect the mobile crowdsourcing participants from bias or discrimination, encouraging them to participate for the public good. The project involves synergized efforts from mobile crowdsourcing, public health science, data analytics, privacy, and social science. Education and outreach activities are designed to increase the participation of women and minority in science and engineering.<br/><br/>This project develops an interdisciplinary framework for location privacy preservation, mobile crowdsourcing, data analytics, social science, and public health science, and contains a research plan with four interconnected thrusts. First, a novel location differential privacy preservation mechanism named differentially private hexagonal hierarchical geospatial indexing system (DPH3) will be developed, which can well represent physical community structure in the map, guarantee mobile crowdsourcing participants? location differential privacy, and provide high mobile crowdsourcing utility for CSM construction in terms of map coverage and accuracy. Second, a coverage-aware crowdsourcing participant recruitment scheme based on DPH3 and approximation algorithm will be designed to guarantee the crowdsensing coverage while preserving participants' location differential privacy. Third, a quality-assured CSM will be constructed by using virus propagation model as the prior knowledge for detrending in ordinary kriging and robust estimation for mitigating the impact of location privacy preserving noises added by DPH3. Fourth, a strategic communication approach to community engagement from the perspective of social science will be used to motivate community members? activeness in information seeking and sharing about COVID-19 symptoms, facilitate crowdsourcing needed for the CSM, as well as empower the community members.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

604	Jonathan Arnold	University of Georgia Research Foundation Inc	None	2020-04-15	2021-03-31	RAPID: finding virulence genes as therapeutic targets in Covid-19	Biological Sciences - This RAPID award is made by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. This award to the University of Georgia will leverage bioinformatics tools to identify virulence genes that assisted SARS-COV-2 in jumping species boundaries. Identifying shared genetic changes between human SARS-COV-2 and its relatives in mammalian reservoirs in the bat, pangolin, and civit is important to understanding the virus mode of action. It is especially critical to identify which of the changes contribute to human virulence of SARS-COV-2. The researchers will analyze 3200+ genomes from SARS-COV-2 and coronavirus genomes from animal reservoirs to look at genetic changes associated with virulence and COVID-19 symptoms. To accomplish this work, new software tools will be developed to better leverage modern computer graphics processing units (GPUs) for high-speed parallel computing. The project will engage graduate students and REU participants in interdisciplinary research of critical national importance and contribute useful tools for future bioinformatic research.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to identify virulence genes that enable SARS-COV-2 to jump species boundaries from vertebrate reservoirs. The project has three main components: (1) building gene trees within species trees of coronavirus by coalescent methods; (2) testing for shared polymorphisms under selective sweep between natural reservoirs and human SARS-COV-2; (3) validating candidates identified in task (2) independently by comparing gene genealogies for selective sweep (under selection for virulence) vs. incomplete lineage sorting. An interdisciplinary team from genetics, bioinformatics, and infectious diseases will develop gene trees within a species tree of 3,200+ published SARS-COV-2 genomes using a novel BEST coalescent method developed for GPUs. Results from these studies will be rapidly disseminated and published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at scientific conferences, and made available through shared software repositories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

605	Natalia Trayanova	Johns Hopkins University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Prediction of Cardiac Dysfunction in COVID-19 Patients Using Machine Learning	Engineering - Recent reports demonstrate the critical influence of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system, with up to 20% of COVID-19 patients suffering acute cardiac injury. Approaches to identify COVID-19 patients at risk for cardiac dysfunction have not yet been developed, and no alerting clinical parameters are available to address the impending decline of cardiac function and mortality. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning approach to identify COVID-19 patients at risk for cardiac dysfunction and sudden cardiac death. Utilizing such an approach will provide early warning and enable the delivery of early goal-directed therapy, reducing mortality and optimizing allocation of resources. The machine learning classifier is to be distributed to any interested healthcare institution, to augment their ability to successfully treat patients. This project also provides fundamental new scientific knowledge: how COVID-19-related cardiac injury could result in cardiac dysfunction and sudden cardiac death. Such knowledge is of paramount importance in the fight against COVID-19 and the post-disease adverse effects on human health. <br/><br/>Features that will serve as input into the machine learning classifier will be extracted from both time series (ECG, cardiac-specific laboratory values, continuously-obtained vital signs) and imaging data (CT, echocardiography). Data will be collected from patients admitted to Johns Hopkins Hospital and Johns Hopkins Health System; other hospitals in the Chesapeake area; and potetially hospitals in NYC, with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 based on nucleic acid or polymerase chain reaction testing. We will develop a time-varying risk score that will determine the posterior probability of hemodynamically-significant cardiac disease outcome within 24 hours of certain time points. For new patients, the model will be used to perform a baseline prediction which will be updated in a Bayesian fashion each time new data becomes available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

606	Bradley Olsen	Massachusetts Institute of Technology	None	2020-07-01	2021-06-30	RAPID: Collaborative Research: Augmenting Mucosal Gels with Associating Brush Polymers to Prevent COVID-19 Infection	Mathematical and Physical Sciences - The SARS-CoV-2 causes the novel coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19). A key challenge with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is developing protective countermeasures that can slow the spread of the disease. With funding from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Professors Stephen L. Craig and Michael Rubinstein of Duke University and Bradley D. Olsen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are developing macromolecules for use as inhaled countermeasures to reduce the rate of infection with SARS-CoV-2. Mucus clearance is an essential defense mechanism in mammalian lungs. It is used to capture and clear inhaled infectious agents, such as SARS-CoV-2 virus, from airway surfaces. The team prepares macromolecules or polymers consisting of many repeating units linked with covalent bonds. These large molecules are constructed in order to mimic properties of mucins in the human body. Additionally, the synthetic mucin mimics are tagged with binders that are specific for SARS-CoV-2. The prepared mucus-mimicking polymers are designed to blend efficiently with natural mucus in the body once introduced. This allows the polymers to act as effective decoys that bind to viral receptors in SARS-CoV-2. As a result, the pathways by which the virus enters the lungs and infects cells are blocked. Apart from synthetic chemistry, computational modelling is also used in this research to guide and speed up experimental design. Scientific advances associated with this research could be particularly useful for health care workers who are exposed to a heavy dose of SARS-CoV-2, but may also be scaled to the civilian population. The project also contributes to the training of postdoctoral students in a highly interdisciplinary research environment.<br/><br/>The research team is developing an inhaled polymeric countermeasure that will reinforce mucosal layers, enabling individuals to demonstrate a substantially decreased rate of infection from SARS-CoV-2 after exposure or to tolerate a larger dose without developing severe symptoms. In the first project goal, new bottlebrush polymers functionalized with readily available luteolin-, quercetin- and cepharantine-based binders for SARS-CoV-2 are synthesized using ruthenium catalyzed ring opening metathesis polymerization. Systematic studies are then conducted to explore how the ligand and polymer design affect their multi-virus binding using both theory and experiment. The second goal focuses on understanding how mucin-mimetic bottlebrush polymers incorporate into supramolecular networks formed by native mucins and how they can maintain key mechanistic properties of these natural systems while reducing viral penetration. The probability of association, network formation, microphase separation, and macroscopic phase separation is predicted using modified molecular models. Cell sheet testing is used to quantify the impact of the mucin-mimetic polymers on infectivity. This research has the potential to advance the design of bottlebrush polymers by expanding new ligand conjugation schemes that enable SARS-CoV-2-specific ligands to be attached to bottlebrush polymers. Novel methods of theory and simulation are also developed for both viral diffusion and blends of synthetic bottlebrushes and natural mucins, which could be applicable to other biological systems.<br/><br/>This grant is being awarded using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

607	Chelsea LeNoble	Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	RAPID: Collaborative Proposal: Effects of Institutional Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic on Undergraduate Faculty and Students Across STEM Disciplines	Education and Human Resources - The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in unprecedented, nation-wide disruption of academic institutions. As a result, there is an urgent need to understand the acute effects of this disruption on undergraduate STEM education in the U.S. This project will examine experiences of faculty and students resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent institutional changes. Initiated during a time of uncertainty, this project will: (1) capture the ephemeral nature of undergraduate education experiences before national recovery milestones are achieved; and (2) inform efforts to adapt undergraduate STEM education during crises. The project team will collect data about institutional characteristics and crisis communication messages, as well as about experiences of individual faculty and students. These data will be analyzed to identify pathways through which the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced teaching and learning within undergraduate STEM education. The findings of this project will be used to develop actionable recommendations for institutions of higher education, including crisis communication strategies, guidelines for pedagogy in times of crisis, and checklists of resources. As the STEM workforce plays a critical role in the economic health of the U.S. in normal and disaster situations, this effort to rapidly collect data and learn from this situation will contribute to the security and well-being of society. It is expected that the results will also support a more resilient, globally competitive next generation of STEM workers. <br/><br/>The project?s specific aims are to: (1) examine teaching and learning experiences of undergraduate faculty and students in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) examine the effects of faculty and student reactions on undergraduate STEM teaching and learning; and (3) leverage findings to develop actionable recommendations for colleges and universities to best prepare and protect their faculty, staff, and students and the integrity of undergraduate STEM education. The goal of these activities is to answer key research questions: How do institutions? COVID-19 policies influence faculty and student attitudes, perceptions, and behavior related to STEM teaching and learning? What teaching and learning resources were most important for undergraduate STEM faculty and students? How do these effects on undergraduate STEM education develop over time? Given the rapidly changing nature of the situation, individual-level data that are needed to answer the research questions are inherently ephemeral. Faculty and students are unlikely to accurately later recall the extent to which they were able to adapt to changes, the extent to which changes created distress, and how they coped with events. Using the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, faculty and students from a stratified random sample of representative institutions will be recruited to participate in an online survey and semi-structured interviews conducted across three time points. Grounded in the research literatures of crisis communication, organizational science, and disaster management, this project addresses gaps in undergraduate STEM education research related to faculty and student reactions to disruptive contexts, characteristics of institutions that make them resilient toward disruptive contexts, and institutional learning from disruptive contexts. The findings will be disseminated to institutions of higher education and through a public web site relating to the resources most critical for fostering resilience among faculty and staff when adapting to a disrupted educational context. In addition, participating institutions and individuals will receive customized reports and resources. By evaluating the immediate impact of COVID-19, this project aims to enhance the undergraduate education infrastructure, improve the delivery of STEM education during and after disruptions, and help to protect the well-being of faculty and students collectively experiencing this crisis.

609	Elinor Karlsson	University of Massachusetts Medical School	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	RAPID: Comparative genomics of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and immune defense in mammals	Biological Sciences - The goal of this project is to compare genomes of hundreds of mammal species, finding differences in DNA that distinguish species resistant to SARS-CoV-2 from those that are very susceptible. This information is needed to understand how the current SARS-CoV-2 virus spread to humans and to identify potential host animals (e.g., pet, livestock, and pest species) that may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 in the USA. SARS-CoV-2, the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic, can infect diverse species of animals. There is a variation in susceptibility to and severity of disease between species. This variation suggests that some species have genetic differences that dictate susceptibility to COVID-19. This work will identify how coronaviruses adapt to new host species, information that will help predict and control future coronavirus outbreaks. Funding will support training a graduate student in research, thereby training the next generation of the bioeconomy workforce. <br/><br/>This project will investigate how the host genome shapes host-pathogen interactions, and how coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2 evolve to exploit new hosts. The researchers will compare existing genomic data for hundreds of mammals using three complementary approaches: (1) Measure structural and sequence homology in two host proteins, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, necessary for infection in humans; (2) Analyze existing RNA-seq datasets to (a) identify species with co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and potentially other proteases implicated in infection, in the same tissue, and (b) search for incidental coronaviral sequence data from diverse mammalian species; (3) Test for variants in evolutionarily conserved elements that are correlated with species susceptibility, using forward genomics. With these analyses, the researchers will identify species with potential as reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2 viral spillback into humans, and those that are promising systems for investigating SARS-CoV-2 evolution, host defenses, and host-pathogen interactions.

The objective of the project is to investigate these daily life impacts in real time and to analyze how these impacts are affected by sociodemographic characteristics that affect time use and well-being. Data are leveraged from several hundred respondents? daily time use before the pandemic along with data collected during and after the pandemic to create a natural experiment that isolates the effects of the pandemic on changes in behavior. Among the products of this research are evidence-based recommendations to address the social consequences of the pandemic.<br/><br/>This project collects data for the second and third waves of a three-wave panel study, the second wave during the pandemic with shelter-at-home and lockdown orders in place and the third wave after the pandemic has subsided and orders have been relaxed. Data for these two waves consist of survey responses and 24-hour time diaries collected from 2,000 respondents from online crowdsourcing platforms. This sample includes a smaller sample from whom data were collected before the pandemic. Data are collected on sociodemographics, typical sleep, work, and exercise patterns, and arrangements for housework and carework to investigate effects on time use and wellbeing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

611	Joao Hespanha	University of California-Santa Barbara	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	COVID 19: RAPID: Informed Decision Making for Pandemic Management	Engineering - The primary goal of the proposal is to develop a set of tools to inform and advise decision makers to control large-scale global pandemics. Specific research problems to be addressed include (1) Making reliable predictions for the state of the pandemic in the next few days/weeks/months. (2) Estimating the effect of governmental measures in the dynamics of the pandemic. (3) Designing protocols for effective control of a pandemic to prevent overloading the healthcare system. Efficient management of large-scale epidemics that are likely to overwhelm the health care system on a national scale, which would surely lead to a significant increase in the loss of human lives, including deaths not related to the specific pathogen causing the epidemic. <br/><br/>This project will make contributions to the fundamental research on developing actionable models for epidemic estimation and control. Specifically, the focus is on models that are amenable to (i) the estimation of model parameters, (ii) the estimation of the state of the epidemic, and (iii) computing optimal intervention policies; all three with high degrees of confidence based on the relatively small datasets that are available while an epidemic is evolving. The research includes data-driven techniques to determine the impact of non-pharmaceutical social measures for epidemic management. A key challenge in this area is to reliably infer causal relationships between social measures and their effect in the epidemic dynamics. Methods will be developed to determine intervention policies that minimize the loss of human life and economic impact, without overwhelming the healthcare system. The existence of delays from actuation (e.g., through social measures) to effects (e.g., in changes of infection rates) and the large uncertainty in the actuation mechanisms pose significant technical challenges that must be addressed through robust decision policies. This project will also provide training opportunities for students in the areas of system modeling, identification, and control.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

612	Daniel Preston	William Marsh Rice University	None	2020-06-01	2021-05-31	Collaborative Proposal: RAPID: Thermal Sterilization of Personal Protective Equipment Contaminated with SARS-CoV-2	Engineering - As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread, medical workers in the United States face a dire shortage of personal protective equipment, including masks, face shields, and gowns. As a result, many doctors and nurses are reusing personal protective equipment intended to be discarded after a single use and thereby increasing their risk of contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. These medical workers, and also the general public, urgently need reliable guidelines for sterilization of personal protective equipment to enable safe reuse. Dry heat sterilization can be performed almost anywhere (including home ovens and rice cookers), and viruses inside of crevices or within fabrics are easily inactivated; this project will provide evidence-based guidelines for the time required to achieve sterilization at a given temperature. The project will also enable prediction of the lifetime of human coronaviruses across various climates, which will be of extreme importance to epidemiologists in predicting the spread of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the severity of a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic that may accompany the return of colder weather this upcoming autumn and winter.<br/><br/>This collaborative research project will produce a thermodynamic model that combines a framework built on the Arrhenius equation and the rate law with both existing and forthcoming experimental data to accurately describe the thermal inactivation time of SARS-CoV-2. The proposed thermodynamic model will treat viruses as large molecules that undergo thermal denaturation and will be used to predict inactivation times for viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, by incorporating physical properties of each virus as inputs to determine the dependence of viral inactivation rate on temperature and other environmental conditions. The project will aim to achieve three objectives, namely: (1) to model the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 due to thermal degradation, including the effects of humidity, pH, surface material, and other conditions in addition to temperature; (2) to experimentally demonstrate sterilization due to thermal inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 on medical personal protective equipment and refine the thermodynamic model by incorporating data from these experimental results; and (3) to characterize thermal degradation of personal protective equipment during repeated thermal sterilization cycles. This work will lead to an unprecedented fundamental understanding of the thermal inactivation of viruses that will help fight the current COVID-19 pandemic and provide the basis for modeling viruses that cause future outbreaks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

613	Allison Aiello	University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	Collaborative Research: RAPID: Statistical Tools to Quantify and Mitigate the Spread of COVID-19	Mathematical and Physical Sciences - This project will develop rigorous statistical models and inference tools to better understand the spread of COVID-19 as well as the type of the interventions that are most likely to work to prevent further outbreak. The work will result in concrete approaches for quantifying uncertainty of possible outcomes and provide reliable tools to assist decision makers in designing mitigation strategies for the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, a new statistical inference tool will be developed to estimate the key epidemic parameters that describe the nature of the COVID-19 spread in an interpretable manner. These parameters are critical for providing reliable forecasts through real-time simulation of potential outbreaks. The new models will analyze the effects of changing social contact structures on the spread of COVID-19, and account for missing or partial data in a systematic way. The results of this project will contribute to the scientific and mathematical approaches needed to provide effective and quick understanding of future epidemics or relevant phenomena.<br/><br/>Existing epidemic models largely rely on deterministic systems that are unable to quantify the uncertainty critical for decision making. In addition, data analysis and predictive modeling for the COVID-19 pandemic require statistical tools for fitting epidemic models with only partially available data. However, most stochastic models face challenges in the face of missing data. To address this gap, the project team will develop new stochastic compartmental models that extend classical approaches to explicitly account for changes to the social contact network underlying the disease spread. These new developments will be accompanied by likelihood-based methods to infer key epidemic parameters that offer mechanistic interpretations with uncertainty quantification. In particular, missing data such as infection times at the individual level will be accounted for via novel data augmentation techniques. The results of this project will provide guidance both to the scientific community on how to evaluate the COVID-19 pandemic, and to the general public on which mitigation strategies would be most effective.<br/><br/>This grant is being awarded using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

614	Juyeong Choi	Florida State University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: The Impact of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic on Municipal Solid Waste Management Systems	Engineering - The coronavirus pandemic is challenging municipal solid waste management systems (MSWMSs). In an effort to prevent its spread, most people are working from home, which means that they are generating a larger amount of residential waste than normal. Further, the capacity of MSWMSs is being constrained by the increasing number of unavailable workers due to self-quarantining and the isolation of local areas as a result of travel bans. With a pandemic, the function and interplay of different system components (i.e., waste collection companies, waste transfer stations, local government agencies, material recovery facilities, and landfills) must become more adaptive to maximize the limited capacity, which is key to accommodating excessive waste demand. In this RAPID project, the project team will collect ephemeral data on the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on MSWMSs in multiple U.S. states including Florida, New York, and California. Since the impact of the coronavirus on MSWMSs and their responses vary across states and from urban to rural setting, these data can be used to (i) identify and characterize a broad range of regional waste management challenges, (ii) track the emerging adaptive behaviors different system entities take to adequately operate municipal waste services, and (iii) specify the system requirements and characteristics (i.e., system composition, topology, and control) that enable successful adaptation during a pandemic. This project will yield a database of pandemic impacts and responses and associated attributes and variables in MSWMSs that will guide researchers, private sectors, regulators, and planning agencies toward the creation and implementation of resilient waste management operations for pandemics. <br/><br/>The primary project tasks are threefold. First, the team will identify and map entities, operations, relationships, and controls in each system through virtual meetings with waste management companies and solid waste management authorities, and review of waste management guidelines. This step will establish a baseline structure for the normal operation, which will help to distinguish entities' emerging behaviors during the pandemic. Second, an online survey will ask system entities about their waste-related challenges and responses; the survey will occur once per month over a six-month period. If normal operations require adaptation of system structure, an interview will be held to gain more insight into the collective decision-making context. Third, a virtual workshop with a technical advisory group will be organized at the end of this project to review MSWMSs' reported adaptive measures and discuss recommendations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

615	Ken Halvorsen	SUNY at Albany	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Enzyme-free detection of coronavirus RNA using reconfigurable DNA nanoswitches	Engineering - A critical aspect of controlling the current COVID-19 outbreaks is early and fast detection of the infected population. Current methods for detecting the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 typically require a laboratory and use expensive equipment and reagents. These requirements limit the number of tests that can be performed nationwide. In this project, the research team aims to develop an alternative diagnostic approach that directly detects the viral RNA without any amplification, labeling, or the use of enzymes. The assay requires minimal steps and uses a compact, bufferless gel cartridge system that can be deployed in a clinical setting. Beyond the current COVID-19 outbreak, this sensing platform can also apply to other existing or emerging viruses.<br/><br/>This work aims to develop a nanoswitch assay sensitive enough to detect clinical levels of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA within 1 hour. Once the viral RNA is extracted from a sample, the RNA is fragmented and mixed with the DNA-based nanoswitches. Hybridization of a viral RNA fragment of a specific sequence with a nanoswitch induces a conformational change of the engineered DNA strand from its linear "off" state to a looped "on" state. After separation of the target-bound looped form from the linear nanoswitches by electrophoresis in a gel cartridge system, the viral load is quantified from the intensity of the looped (on) nanoswitches in a gel image.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Data is required on the transmission of pathogen carrying airborne mucosalivary droplets and aerosols generated during normal breathing, talking, sneezing, and coughing. Synthetic exhalations will be measured leveraging advanced prototyping to obtain data needed to model the spread of covid-19, and the efficacy of personal protection devices and face coverings fabricated with various weaves and materials will be tested. Physical data related to temperature, humidity, and airflow on survival and dispersion of exhalations will be obtained. The data will be integrated using supervised machine learning methods, mathematical network simulations, and epidemiological data to develop an individual-based method that can give pandemic management results. Physical data will be published on transmission rates, including wearing of personal protective equipment and face coverings with various weaves, to inform mitigation strategies to alleviate covid-19 pandemic. Interactive Web based resources will be used for immediate broad dissemination of data and learning outcomes on covid-19 to the public, in addition to peer reviewed publications and training post-doctoral and undergraduate researchers in methods leading to pandemic mitigation.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The mode of transmission and extent of environmental contaminations on the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (covid-19), while sharing features with severe acute respiratory syndrome and other infectious diseases, remains unknown. This project will address fundamental rheology-matched metrics of transport and survival of airborne exhalation droplets and aerosols that carry coronavirus and on surfaces needed as input parameters for modeling mitigation. Impact of personal protective equipment on individual prognosis, with physical data related to temperature, humidity, and airflow-dependent dispersion distance of pathogen bearing viscoelastic droplets corresponding to breathing, sneezing, and coughing, will be obtained. The impact of the measured transmission rates on the spread and recurrence will be investigated with epidemiological data integrated with deep learning to implement a scalable, individual-based, stochastic, spatial model. Resulting peer-reviewed publications will serve as trusted source for calculation of covid-19 transmissibility and personal protection strategies. Post-doctoral and undergraduate researchers versed in fluid dynamics, soft matter physics, and network simulations will be trained toward mitigating infectious disease spread.<br/><br/>This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) grant supports research that will result in spatiotemporal mucosalivary droplet transmission range data required to develop covid-19 mitigation network methods with funding from the CARES Act managed by the Condensed Matter Physics Program in the Division of Materials Research of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

617	Jurij Leskovec	STANFORD UNIVERSITY	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Collaborative Research: Computational Drug Repurposing for COVID-19	Computer and Information Science and Engineering - With the disruptive nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, effective treatments could save the lives of severely ill patients, protect individuals with a high risk of infection, and reduce the time patients spend in hospital beds. However, there are currently no effective treatments for COVID-19. Traditional methodologies take years to develop and test compounds from scratch. Machine learning provides promising new approaches to repurpose drugs that are safe and already approved for other diseases. This project will develop a machine learning toolset to expedite the development of safe and effective medicines for COVID-19. The toolset will rapidly identify safe repurposing opportunities for approved and experimental drugs. It will predict whether treatments may have therapeutic effects in COVID-19 patients, allowing the identification of drugs and drug cocktails that are safe and plentiful enough to treat a substantial number of patients. By putting tools in the hand of practitioners, the activities in this project will have an immediate impact. They will result in actionable predictions that are accurate and interpretable. <br/><br/>Recently, the principal investigators have developed a series of machine learning tools to identify drug repurposing opportunities. Building on foundational previous work, in this project, the principal investigators will first build a large COVID-19 focused knowledge graph that will capture fundamental and COVID-19-specific biological knowledge. The graph learning methods will be adapted to identify safe drugs and drug cocktails for COVID-19. To predict the safety of cocktails with two or more drugs, the methods will generalize to an exponentially large space of high-order drug combinations. In addition to drug safety, efficacy is a crucial endpoint for drug development. The project will develop a novel graph neural network (GNN) method to identify efficacious drug repurposing opportunities, even for diseases, such as COVID-19, that do not yet have any drug treatments and thereby, no label, supervised information. The method will predict what drugs and drug combinations may have a therapeutic effect on COVID-19. Finally, the principal investigators will integrate the developed tools into a complete, explainable framework that will generate predictions, provide explanations, and incorporate human feedback into the machine learning loop. This project will provide new, open tools for rapid drug repurposing that will be relevant for COVID-19 and other emerging pathogens. Additionally, the project will provide unique opportunities for multi-disciplinary curriculum development, training and advising, and professional activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

What about that package from Amazon? While there is much speculation, we really do not know the answers to these very basic questions about how and where the virus lives outside of humans. The goal of this research is to determine if surfaces commonly touched by humans, but not routinely disinfected, are important for the spread of CoVID-19. Such surfaces will be tested for the presence of the virus. Results will be used to develop new mathematical models to determine if commonly touched surfaces are important for spreading CoVID-19. This research is important not only for society's response to CoVID-19 but also to plan for future pandemics caused by other viruses. The project will also help train the next generation of scientists who study the ecology and spread of disease. <br/><br/>This project will collect thousands of surface swab samples from hundreds of sites around San Diego, USA. The samples will be screened for SARS-CoV-19 using the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reactions (RT-PCR). These data will be used to calibrate, fit and validate dynamical models that describe SARS-CoV-2 transmission from the environmental reservoirs. From these models, important characters of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, including risk of human infections from environmental reservoirs and contribution of environmental reservoirs to the basic reproduction number (R0) of the virus, will be estimated. The swab samples will also be characterized by metatranscriptomics for other viruses and microbes living on the same surfaces. This will be valuable for understanding the community ecology of these micro-environments and serve as a baseline for future studies. Together these intellectual products will have practical impact on controlling CoVID-19 by helping determine whether more effort should be put on disinfecting these surfaces or controlling the virus in other reservoirs.<br/><br/>This RAPID award is made by the Population and Community Ecology Program in the Division of Environmental Biology, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

The lack of testing has resulted in uncertainties about public health policies. Testing is necessary not only for diagnosis but also for tracking to control the pandemic. This work is based on non-traditional techniques for the detection of virus in infected patients. The project will develop an alternative method based on the advances of physics and understanding of the quantum mechanical aspects of interaction of light with matter. The technique will be based on recent discoveries in nanotechnology and solid-state physics, allowing the development of spectroscopy techniques to detect the SARs-Cov-2 virus. The method, named Single Molecule Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SM-SERS), If successful, will allow a fast, inexpensive, and much more precise and reliable method to detect infections. The method is based on the detection the S proteins of the virus, which participate in the cell infection. The ability of SM-SERS to detect down to one molecule of protein will allow early detection of infection and follow up of patients who recover from the illness. In addition, further analysis of the SM-SERS data will help to understand changes on the virus proteins and can help in the development of antiviral drugs.<br/><br/>Technical Description:<br/>During the CoVid-19 pandemic, one of the most challenging aspects has been the lack of testing to detect and trace infections. The limitations in quantities and quality of test kits have resulted in uncertainties about public health policies. Testing is necessary not only for diagnosis but also for tracking to control the pandemic. The practical difficulties to increase the number of available test kits involve, among other things, difficulty in production of the chemicals needed for the test. The most used test, technically known as RT-qPCR, is costly, has a long turnaround time and, although it is highly sensitive, produces many false negatives and are based on biochemical methods. This work is based on the Raman spectroscopy in its SM-SERS modality. The method is based on amplification of the inelastically scattered light by localized surface plasmons on metal nanoparticles. The main goal will be to establish a Raman signature of the spike glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that can be used to develop a detection test. Previous research in the PI's group indicates that tests based on analysis of sialylated glycoproteins have high sensitivity, specificity, and low percentage of false negatives. The project will develop a new type of plasmonic nanoparticles combined with ionic liquids that will improve the nanoparticle delivery to solutions containing the virus. A second interest will be to study the fine peak structure, which is related to morphological changes in the proteins. This will be useful for development of antiviral drugs and the basic understanding of the biology of the virus.<br/><br/>This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) grant supports research that will develop a new method for viral testing with funding from the CARES Act managed by the Condensed Matter Physics Program in the Division of Materials Research of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

620	Javier Arsuaga	University of California-Davis	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Using Data Science and Biophysical Models to Address the COVID-19 Pandemic	Mathematical and Physical Sciences - COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, is at the center of one of the most dangerous pandemics the world has ever known. As it spreads through the Human population the virus mutates producing proteins that can lead to higher infection rates (infectivity), and an increased ability to cause severe disease (virulence). This project will predict the most likely mutations of the virus by combining methods from machine learning, mathematics and biophysics. Specifically, the proteins resulting from viral mutations will be experimentally synthesized, and their infectivity and virulence will be tested by the project team through a collaboration with researchers in industry. This project benefits from unprecedented access to genomic data compiled on SARS-CoV-2, combined with a rich set of novel tools developed through interdisciplinary advances in data science, mathematics, and biophysics. The results of this project will build a pipeline capable of assisting the development of vaccines and drugs against COVID-19 while simultaneously advancing the fields of machine learning and mathematical virology. The project team is led by mathematicians, molecular biologists and biotechnology experts working in an interdisciplinary and collaborative setting. Students and postdoctoral researchers will be trained and will participate in publicly disseminating the findings and results of the project.<br/><br/> <br/>The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is believed to have originated as a bat virus and to have evolved through a combination of sequence mutations, recombination, and natural selection to be infectious in human hosts. Some of the most relevant sequence variations occurred in the S gene encoding the Spike (S) protein. As SARS-CoV-2 spreads through the Human population, mutations of the S gene can potentially increase viral infectivity and virulence. Within the framework of an evolutionary algorithm, the PIs will combine graph theory, topological data analysis, and computational biophysics to characterize the most likely mutations of the S protein. This powerful interdisciplinary approach will draw upon existing experimental data from SARS-CoV-2. The PIs will collaborate with an industrial partner to experimentally design the peptides corresponding to those predicted sequences, and use binding affinity assays and cryo-electron microscopy to test binding of the peptides to the human receptor (ACE2). The resulting pipeline will help us better understand the evolutionary landscape of viral proteins and will assist researchers in the development of anti-viral drugs and vaccines. Future extensions of this work will increase our understanding of how viruses are transmitted across species and propagate in humans. The project will provide multi-disciplinary student and postdoctoral training. The PIs will broadly disseminate their results, as well as the data they collect and software they design.<br/><br/>With this award, the Mathematical Biology Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry are supporting Drs. Arsuaga, Rodriguez, and Vazquez from University of California-Davis to study genomic variations of the SARS-CoV-2 viral spike (S) protein and predict the expansion range of transmission in Human populations.<br/><br/>This grant is being awarded using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

621	Yang Zhang	University of Michigan Ann Arbor	None	2020-06-01	2021-05-31	IIBR: Informatics: RAPID: Genome-wide Structure and Function Modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus	Biological Sciences - The most recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global pandemic. It has spread over more than 200 countries and caused numerous deaths worldwide. The central activities of SARS-CoV-2, including human cell invasion and viral duplication and infection, are conducted through the proteins coded by the viral genome as well as the protein-protein interactions between the virus and its human hosts. Determination of the structures, functions and interactions of protein molecules associated with coronaviruses can thus provide critically important knowledge to help elucidate and end the pandemic. This project will extend state-of-the-art structural bioinformatics methods to generate genome-wide protein structure and function models for SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses, which will help in understanding the general mechanisms and principles governing the virulence, diversity and evolution of these coronaviruses and facilitate the development of new treatments to cure infected individuals and terminate the COVID-19 pandemic. Multiple graduate and undergraduate students, including women and minorities, will be trained through participation in different Objectives of the project. The project results will be integrated with the bioinformatics core courses in the Bioinformatics and Biochemistry PhD Programs and the Museum of Natural History at the University of Michigan, with the purpose of enhancing the outreach and broad impacts of this research on both student and public education.<br/><br/>Accurately modeling protein structure and function has been a long-term challenge in structural bioinformatics and computational biology. A classical approach to this problem is comparative modeling, i.e., deducing information of unknown target proteins from known homologous proteins that are evolutionarily related to the targets. This approach is built on the assumption that similar sequences have similar structures and functions. Although they work well in many applications, the comparative approaches cannot be applied to effectively model proteins associated with SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses, because viral genomes are highly mutable, and many of the genes and gene products belonging to these viruses do not have close homologous templates with other species. To address these issues, this project plans to extend multiple algorithms developed in the PI?s lab, which have been designed primarily for non-homology-based protein structure and function prediction. In particular, the methods will utilize cutting-edge deep convolutional neural-network (DCNN) models to generate amino acid-level contact and distance maps in order to improve protein structure and interaction network modeling accuracy. Since the DCNN models are trained only on sequence databases, the performance of the approaches does not rely on the availability of structural and functional templates and can therefore be effectively used to model the coronavirus proteins that lack homologous templates; successfully developing these methods will also benefit the field of structural bioinformatics in general due to the importance of non-homologous protein structure and function prediction. In summary, the success of this project will result in the development of an urgently needed knowledge base to improve the understanding of fundamental principles associated with human coronaviruses and facilitate the development of new treatments for the COVID-19 pandemic. The data and methods produced by the project will be accessible to the community at https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/COVID-19/.

Studies of crises show that human communities differ significantly in their responses; a crisis presents individual organizations and communities of organizations with a common problem, yet solutions may be elusive. This project will advance basic knowledge about the effectiveness of organizational recovery in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and global economic crisis. The project will help organizations and managers to better understand the conditions under which organizations responding to a crisis of unprecedented magnitude may recover more effectively. Results will equip organizations and managers with knowledge and skills about how to choose strategic responses to crisis, by highlighting the insights derived from study conditions. In collaboration with the University of Florida Entrepreneurship and innovation Center, the project will disseminate results to business and scientific communities by providing free-of-charge webinars that explain to managers and researchers the strategic responses that can help organizations, particularly small-and-medium sized enterprises, to more effectively recover from the current crisis. Project findings and activities will help to ensure the economic competitiveness of the United States and promote our nation's safety and security. <br/> <br/>When crises occur, business organizations need to move strategically to recover, but leaders and managers may be unclear as to which actions to take. The project will provide prescriptive theoretical directions for the development of processes and actions toward effective recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and global economic crisis. The project will classify, explain, and evaluate organizations? strategic responses to the current crisis for effective recovery and answer three research questions: First, among the multiple paths toward organizational recovery, which ones are more effective? Second, what organizational and environmental factors are most conducive to effective recovery? Third, would dynamic adaptation (e.g., switching resource allocation from the organization?s own rebuilding to community-based self-organizing efforts, and vice versa) be effective for recovery? Interview data will be used to inform, validate and improve a computational model designed to explain and evaluate the effectiveness of strategic responses of organizations. The project will use this model to compare a wide range of variation in responses, and probe the conditions under which certain responses could be more effective for organizational recovery. The project will produce: (1) a multi-level taxonomy of strategic responses to crisis for organizational recovery and (2) an explanation and evaluation of strategic responses to crisis for effective recovery. Using a mixed-method approach, the project will not only corroborate a computational model with interview data, but also use the model to extend understanding beyond case observations. Findings will inform theories of organization regarding business strategy, especially within the context of crises and extreme events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

623	Gregory Faris	SRI INTERNATIONAL	None	2020-05-15	2020-10-31	RAPID: Revolutionary Massively-Parallel Bioreactions for COVID-19	Engineering - This project will provide the basis for a new test and diagnostic that can be performed in as little as 2 minutes and a cost as low as $2. This could be used routinely to test for hidden spreaders of disease at airports or entrances to hospitals or long-term care facilities. Availability of this diagnostic would be transformative. The speed and low cost could provide the first point-of-contact molecular tests diagnostic for diseases such as COVID-19. Two minutes and $2 is fast enough and inexpensive enough to perform such routine screening in airports to detect asymptomatic spreaders as they embark or disembark from airplanes. Thus, this tool could prevent such diseases from spreading beyond the initial outbreak. Similarly, the method could be used to screen employees when they arrive to work at hospitals, long-term care facilities, or prisons, and avoid the huge toll a disease such as COVID-19 is taking. Finally, the method could be used for routine screening at large facilities such as factories, food processing or distribution facilities, and large government buildings, allowing our economy to return to a more normal state. The research will also lead to new knowledge on performing massively-parallel microscale reactions and provide training for a student. <br/><br/>This project will advance research and applications on massively-parallel bioreactions to enable a new point-of-contact for testing and diagnostic that will have a transformative impact on how we handle pandemics such as COVID-19. The technology will enable a 2-minute test for sample diagnostic at a cost of $2 per assay. The investigator uses a new format to speed thermal cycling while achieving approximately 1,000,000-fold sample partitioning to accelerate sample preparation without micro-patterning or microfluidics. They will achieve the required large area temperature uniformity using optical heating while simultaneously using confinement of lateral diffusion to produce ~1,000,000 virtual reaction wells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Epidemiologists have cautioned that a return to ?normal activities? requires contact tracing, which begins with interviews of infected persons and allows for the identification and isolation of other exposed individuals. Critically, contact tracing interviews are fundamentally a memory task, yet the methods used generally do not incorporate memory-facilitating techniques. Further, research has generally found that critical groups in this pandemic, children and the elderly, often perform worse on memory tasks than adolescents and young and middle-aged adults. As such, there is reason for concern about the accuracy and completeness of reports provided in contact tracing interviews, particularly for individuals within critical life phases. This project examines the time-critical issue of how enhanced memory strategies can improve contact tracing. Through this research, developmental and cognitive science can play a role in our recovery from this pandemic, as well as other health-related crises.<br/><br/>The proposed study tests whether memory for contacts can be improved across the lifespan utilizing empirically-informed interview techniques. Specifically, this study tests whether individuals between the ages of 9 and 90 recall more contacts when queried via a cognitively-informed contact tracing interview, as compared to a baseline interview. The study will also examine the effectiveness of two types of administration: a self-administered survey format, and a live interview via video-conferencing. Developmental differences in the nature of the contacts recalled, such as the individual?s familiarity with the contact, will also be analyzed. The results of this study will directly inform our ability to conduct effective contact tracing interviews with individuals of all ages. Findings can also aid frontline workers? ability to conduct safe, efficient, and effective developmentally-appropriate interviews.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Guided by global rules (the International Health Regulations), the WHO has taken action to limit the harm caused by the virus while at the same time protecting the international travel and trade. This grant will determine how Canada has adhered to these global rules and what it can do to support them. We will review stories from the media, important policy documents and other relevant materials. We will also interview key people in Canada and around the world involved in protecting the public from these threats. We will specifically examine if there is an opportunity for Canada to help lead efforts to protect the world from similar threats in the future.

Since December 2019, over 67,000 people have been infected and more than 1,500 have died. Infectious disease outbreaks pose a severe threat to the physical and mental health of individuals and populations worldwide. A better understanding of social and cultural factors that contribute to public knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19 are needed to develop evidence informed strategies to combat misinformation, stigma and fear. In response to this challenge this study proposes to develop a national knowledge translation (KT) campaign to enhance public knowledge, understand public perceptions and develop targeted interventions to close identified public knowledge gaps. This will be achieved in three phases: i) Focus groups with members of the public from 5 provinces to identify major factors influencing public knowledge, perceptions and behaviours during the COVID-19 outbreak. ii) National survey with 1000 members of the public across Canada to create a comprehensive list of top public knowledge gaps, perceptions, and behaviours related to the COVID-19. iii) A national knowledge translation (KT) Campaign to educate, empower and engage the public to increase knowledge and foster positive public change in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic. This study will target the Canadian public with the ultimate goal to educate, empower and engage members of the public to be informed stewards of their health knowledge in relation to the current outbreak by strengthening public understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on individuals and communities and providing evidence informed interventions to inform social and public health responses.

COVID-19 has led to enormous changes in the provision of NHS care. All non-urgent operations have been cancelled and a third of hospital beds converted for use by COVID-19 patients. A&E attendances dropped by 50% in the past month. This will have major impacts on care received by non-COVID-19 patients and their outcomes during and after the outbreak. However, who is affected and how this is likely to impact future health outcomes is currently unknown. We will quantify the reduction in NHS care, and examine its distribution by age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation and geography. We will analyse the latest information from Understanding Society and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing to document disruptions to primary, hospital and community care across England, Scotland and Wales. This will complement analysis of real-time patient records from a large London hospital trust that builds a rich picture of disruptions to hospital care and changes in patient outcomes. This will provide detailed, timely and important evidence of the impacts of the pandemic on care provided to other patients. The research team has already engaged with key policymakers – including HM Treasury and DHSC – providing evidence on the impacts of COVID-19, and the related economic downturn, on patient health. This research will provide new empirical evidence to help allocate NHS resources to minimise risks to patient health.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	127526.0 GBP

Since it is expected that COVID-19 will be comparatively harmless or even asymptomatic in children, it can be assumed that a high number of infections in this group will be not detected, causing children to act as spreaders of the infection. The aim of this study is to obtain a prospective monthly estimate of the seroprevalence of an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 in children and adolescents in Germany in the period from 01.05.2020 to 30.04.2021 in 12 sentinel children's hospitals and thereby describe the yearly course of the epidemic in children and adolescents: • What is the maximum prevalence reached at the peak of the epidemic? • When does the monthly increment flatten? • Are there differences with the temporal course by age, sex, and region? • What is the estimated burden of suffering related to the SARS-Cov-2 in children? • Does the burden of suffering vary by age, sex, ethnicity or underlying disease? • Which proportion of confirmed positive cases has been previously diagnosed by a physician or other medical experts?

Up to now, no vaccines or efficient therapeutic strategies are available. Many clinical approaches focus on repurposing of approved therapeutics against other diseases. However, efficacy of these compounds on viral infection or even harmful secondary effects in context of SARS-CoV-2 infection is sparsely investigated. Similarly, adverse events of commonly used therapeutics against lifestyle diseases are unknown. Major problems correlated to COVID-19 are lung tissue damage, dysregulation of the innate immune response and abnormal coagulation parameters. To investigate processes that maintain lung homeostasis, we have established a human alveolus-on-a-chip model, which is composed of epithelial-cells and endothelial-cells as well as macrophages. By use of this system, the alveolar homeostasis, which is easily dysbalanced by infections, can be examined. We will investigate (a) the replication efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 isolates in epithelial and endothelial cells, (b) the effects of infection on innate immune response (c) the barrier integrity and regulation of vascular coagulation and fibrinolysis system and (d) the effects of commonly used therapeutics on SARS-CoV-2 infection that also act on the vascular system.

The viral entry of coronaviruses is based on binding of the viral spike protein (S protein) to cellular receptors and on S protein processing by host cell proteases. It is known that SARS-CoV-2 uses the human receptor ACE2 for cell entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for "priming" the S protein. The protease inhibitor Camostat, which has already been used clinically, reduces cell infection. So far, this has only been shown in cell lines or cell cultures that do not reflect the complexity of the three-dimensional alveolar lung cell association with type I, type II cells, endothelial cells and alveolar macrophages. The aim of the proposed project is to test Camostat in a preclinical model of human ex vivo lung cultures to better estimate the therapeutic potency of Camostat in COVID-19. The effects of Camostat in different doses at different times of infection of human ex vivo cultivated and infected with SARS-CoV-2 lung tissue are to be tested. Viral replication and the formation of interferons and selected pro-inflammatory cytokines are determined. These are the primary relevant readout parameters in an established model, supernatants and tissue are recorded in a biobank for follow-up analyzes. Depending on the findings, the experiments can be extended to other locally available relevant human ex vivo infection models of the upper respiratory tract (nasal turbinates, mucous membranes, sinuses, tonsils).

To instruct T cells viral components must be presented by MHC molecules alongside costimulatory molecules on antigen-presenting cells. MHC molecules show a high degree of variation across the population and the distribution of these variants (allotypes) vary significantly between individuals and ethnicities. Thus, T cell responses are significantly tailored by the combination of an MHC allotype and the presented viral peptide. Recombinantly expressed MHC allotypes will be loaded with in silico predicted and verified viral peptides. Using these sets together with newly discovered costimulatory molecules for T cells will enable us to expand and visualize specific T-cell responses of small subpopulations. The novel approach will be used to characterize the T-cell responses of recovered SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals to determine their effector and memory response which mediated protection/cure. Results will be compared to T-cell responses of COVID-19 patients in the first phase of the disease for prediction of disease outcome. In perspective, the novel approach can also be utilized to expand and manipulate SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses as cellular therapy for COVID-19 patients. Our results will provide novel insights into the mechanisms of cellular adaptive immune responses against the still largely unknown SARS-CoV-2 virus, which could form a basis for diagnosis and future therapy of this infection."; Research Type: discovery; Study population: not applicable	Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung	Research Grant	276658.0 EUR

To prevent the medical and health system from becoming overwhelmed by patients in need of treatment, efforts are being made to slow the spread of the disease over as long a period as possible. Due to the expected increase in the number of new infections, further measures and guidelines can be expected in the coming weeks and months that will affect virtually all aspects of people’s lives in Germany. Urgent questions arise as to the medical and health impacts of the virus; the social, psychological, economic, and political factors that affect its spread; and the consequences thereof—questions that cannot currently be investigated due to the lack of a generalizable database. The planned research project aims to investigate the acute, medium-term, and long-term socio-economic factors in and consequences of the spread of the coronavirus in Germany. Based on standardized telephone surveys of a representative sample of Germany’s will focus on subjective experiences, on how informed the population is, on how people are handling the crisis at an individual level, and on identifying the individual and social factors that play a role in this crisis and the consequences thereof. The survey will cover the following topics: a) health behavior and health inequality, b) labor market and economic situations, c) social life, networks, and mobility, d) mental health and well-being, and e) social cohesion.

Beyond the tragic health toll of this outbreak, there has been increased targeting of minority groups of U.S. residents. The Coronavirus outbreak has refueled stereotypes (e.g., eating ?strange? foods, having unsanitary lifestyles, being disease-ridden) that are veiled under health-related fears. Racial discrimination significantly decreases well-being and increases psychological distress as well as mental and physical health. Most studies on the effects of racism on identity, resilience, and parental socialization, have focused on discrimination among adolescents and emerging adults. This innovative interdisciplinary study will significantly advance our understanding of risk and resilience in response to acute social stress among families with children in three different age groups, early childhood (4-7 years), middle childhood (8-11 years) and early-to-mid adolescence (12-15 years). Findings will identify key developmental and social processes that influence how identities of racial minority parents and their children are formed. The influence of an acute but prolonged threat to their social identities resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak may provide insight into the general nature of this process as well. <br/><br/>This interdisciplinary team comprising a cultural developmental scientist, a school psychologist, and a computer scientist will study multiple forms of COVID-19 racial discrimination and the subsequent impact on the identity development and adjustment of minority parents and children. The study will focus on how parents socialize their children about issues of race and identity in reaction to this event at the early part of 2020 and again 6-9 months later. Protective factors for adjustment in parents and children will also be identified. In addition, large scale texts of outbreak-related social media (Twitter) posts will be analyzed to account for how public opinion, anxiety, and discriminatory attitudes evolve with the peaking and fading of this epidemic and provide objective indicators of the larger public social discourse climate across the year. Infectious diseases will continue to emerge and re-emerge globally, and their negative impact on psychological and social health is understudied but highly significant, leading to both significant social and economic consequences. Knowledge from this research may help inform the types of services and education that can promote well-being in targeted marginalized groups and the larger public during future similar events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

COVID-19, which emerged out of the city of Wuhan in China in December 2019 is now spreading in multiple countries. It is particularly concerning that the case fatality rate appears to be higher for the novel coronavirus than for seasonal influenza, and especially so for older populations and those with prior health conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Any plan for stopping the epidemic must be based on a quantitative understanding of the proportion of the at-risk population that needs to be protected by effective control measures in order for transmission to decline sufficiently and quickly enough for the epidemic to end. Different data collection and testing modalities and strategies available to help calibrate transmission models and predict the spread/severity of a disease, have variable costs, response times, and accuracies. In this Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project, the team will examine the problem of establishing optimal practices for rapid testing for the novel coronavirus. The result will be the Rapid Testing for Epidemic Modeling (RTEM), which will translate into science-based predictions of the COVID-19 epidemic's characteristics, including the duration and overall size, and help the global efforts to combat the disease. The RTEM will fill an important gap in data-driven decision making during the COVID-19 epidemic and, thus, will enable services with significant national economic and health impact. The educational impact of the project will be on mentoring of post-doctoral and PhD researchers and on curricula by incorporating research challenges and outcomes into existing undergraduate and graduate classes. <br/><br/>Computational models for the spatio-temporal dynamics of emerging infectious diseases and data- and model-driven computer simulations for disease spreading are increasingly critical in predicting geo-temporal evolution of epidemics as well as designing, activating, and adapting practices for controlling epidemics. In this project, the researchers tackle a Rapid Testing for Epidemic Modeling (RTEM) problem: Given a partially known target disease model and a set of testing modalities (from surveys to surveillance testing at known disease hotspots), with varying costs, accuracies, and observational delays, what is the best rapid testing strategy that would help recover the underlying disease model? Several scientific questions arise: What is the value of testing? Should only sick people be tested for virus detection? What level of resources should be devoted to the development of highly accurate tests (low false positives, low false negatives)? Is it better to use only one type of test aiming at the best cost/effectiveness trade off, or a non-homogeneous testing policy? Naturally these questions need to be investigated at the interface of epidemiology, computer science, machine learning, mathematical modeling and statistics. As part of the work, the team will develop a model of transmission dynamics and control, tailored to COVID-19 in a way that accommodates diagnostic testing with varying fidelities and delays underlying a rapid testing regimen. The investigators will further integrate the resulting RTEM-SEIR model with EpiDMS and DataStorm for executing continuous coupled simulations.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded through the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program (Division of Environmental Biology) and the Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing innovation program (Engineering).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented as part of a broader effort to slow the spread of the disease. U.S. citizens were instructed to increase hygiene efforts such as hand-washing and to increase social distancing by limiting contact with other people, especially in large crowds. In some states, school and business closures, as well as other forms of mandated restrictions, also began impacting people and families. Understanding the public?s response to this ongoing outbreak is vital, and social psychological and decision-science perspectives may uniquely contribute to the effectiveness of governmental and non-governmental efforts to respond effectively to further crises. This project examines predictors of behavior during the outbreak (for example, engaging in social distancing), emotional and coping responses (for example, seeking social support), and changes in social attitudes (for example, trust in public policies). The research tests the idea that both personal welfare and collective/national welfare can facilitate appropriate health behaviors. By following people over time during 2020, the study provides periodic snapshots of public responses to the outbreak as well as testing important scientific questions that will inform future public health and disaster-response interventions.<br/><br/>This RAPID project is centered on a four-wave longitudinal survey of a representative sample of 3,000 U.S. residents. Study participants are first contacted in March, 2020, and then again at three later time-points roughly every 12 weeks. The research is designed to provide an index of the evolving public response to the outbreak throughout the year. Threats are conceptualized as either threats to the self or threats to the national welfare. Similarly, reactions to those threats are framed as requiring personal responsibility or requiring a national response. Because the study assesses the same participants over time, the research addresses how changes in people?s circumstances predict changes in psychological and behavioral responses. One question is whether changes in concerns regarding the broader social impact predict adherence to public health advice and mandates differently than concerns about personal health impacts. The study also identifies participants? geographic location; over time, survey responses will be integrated with publicly available data to examine how local factors influence psychological responses. This will help address whether people in states and communities with greater investment in community resilience (e.g., public health funding) show better coping responses to the outbreak than in states and communities with lower investments in community resilience. The study design incorporates communication interventions at waves 2 and 3 to test the role of social norm information and shared (versus individual) responsibility on people?s willingness to follow public health guidelines and mandates. Using these longitudinal, geographic, and experimental methods, the research will test hypotheses on four broad topics: personal and social responsibility, norms and social influence, coping and emotion regulation, and impacts of the outbreak on social cohesion and conflict. The new knowledge will inform future public health and policy interventions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

641	Grzegorz Rempala	Ohio State University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Modeling Outbreak of COVID-19 Using Dynamic Survival Analysis	Mathematical and Physical Sciences - The outbreak of COVID-19 has created a tremendous need for predicting both the dynamics and the size of regional COVID-19 outbreaks. Equally important is the need to determine the potential effects of early interventions such as school closures and mandatory or self-imposed quarantines. To answer these questions, this project will develop a general mathematical framework for analyzing the ongoing outbreak trends using data solely from partially observed new daily infection counts (also known as the epidemic curve). The PI?s new framework will not assume any specific infectious or recovery periods (which are often unknown) or observable prevalence of the disease. The tools developed as part of this project will both help predict the rate of growth of new infections and estimate the effect of social distancing and other preventative measures on flattening the epidemic curve. The PI will use a new dynamical survival analysis approach to predict the trajectory of the COVID-19 epidemic for a mid-western region of the United States. Data from elsewhere in the world, like the city of Wuhan in China, will be used to calibrate the predictions. The project will also provide a practical interdisciplinary training for a PhD student and a post-doctoral fellow.<br/><br/>The modeling and predictive framework to be developed is fundamentally different from the traditional approach based on the incidence or prevalence counts in a compartmental SIR model. Specifically, the PI will apply the dynamical survival analysis (DSA) approach that considers aggregated mean field equations for the underlying large stochastic network and regards them as the approximate survival law of the infection times. The PI will use these DSA-based equations to model both the epidemic and recovery curves and compare them with the ones observed during the COVID-19 outbreak. The statistical analysis of epidemic data performed with the help of the new framework will allow the quick elucidation of the dynamics of an epidemic (for example, the basic reproduction number, R0) and the potential impact of interventions (such as quarantine or social distancing). The new framework will help provide a better understanding of how preventive behaviors affect COVID-19 dynamics via changes in the network structure and changes in disease transmission across edges in the network. This project will develop a user-friendly software package for computer simulations under different parameter and intervention scenarios (for example, vaccination schemes) that will lead to a better understanding of how to control COVID-19 transmission.<br/><br/>This grant is being awarded using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

This RAPID program instead uses fast and inexpensive optical techniques to detect<br/>the physical properties of viral pathogens. The breakthrough that enables this new approach to medical diagnostics is a technique called holographic particle characterization (HPC). HPC creates laser holograms of specially prepared test beads and uses those holograms to monitor small changes in the beads? properties that occur when molecules or virus particles bind to their surfaces. Originally developed for fundamental research in soft condensed matter physics, HPC already has been demonstrated to provide fast and sensitive immunoassays in model systems. These measurements are fast, inexpensive and can be performed automatically with minimal human intervention. The next step is to create libraries of test beads for different target diseases and to demonstrate that HPC can diagnose those diseases - first in the research laboratory, and then in a clinical setting. The anticipated product of this work is a new platform for diagnosing viral infections that can meet the need for fast, accurate and cost-effective testing under the strains imposed by public health crises.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>There is an urgent need for new technologies to detect viral pathogens. Holographic binding assays can detect the presence of virus particles and antibodies in fluid media through their influence on the optical properties of functionalized probe beads. The micrometer-scale beads that will be developed for this program will incorporate chemical groups on their surfaces to selectively bind specific targets, such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19 or the antibodies that are produced in response to infection. Bound targets increase the apparent size of a bead and alter its light-scattering properties. Both of these effects can be resolved directly by holographic particle characterization, a comparatively new platform technology that has the demonstrated ability to measure the diameter and refractive index of micrometer-scale colloidal spheres with part-per-thousand precision. A statistical sample consisting of thousands of single-bead measurements can be completed in a matter of minutes using commercial instrumentation for holographic particle characterization. Specialized reagents are not required. Multiplexed assays for multiple targets can be performed with libraries of functionalized beads that are distinguished by their base diameters and refractive indexes. Each such assay can therefore simultaneously diagnose a viral infection both by the presence of virions, and also by the presence of antibodies. This RAPID program will deliver scalable syntheses of probe beads for diagnosing viral infection and automated protocols for performing holographic binding assays, enabling high-throughput medical diagnostics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

643	Susan Daniel	Cornell University	None	2020-04-01	2021-03-31	RAPID: Revealing the intermolecular interactions between the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 fusion peptide and the host cell membrane that underlie its flexibility in host tropism	Biological Sciences - Coronavirus is a membrane-enveloped package decorated with ?spikes? that protrude from its surface. These spikes interact with the host cell to initiate infection of that cell. The ability of coronavirus to spread to other cells depends on how well the spike interacts with its target host membrane. The part of the spike that controls this interaction is called the ?fusion peptide? and its job is to insert into the host membrane to initiate the delivery its genetic cargo into the cell. However, the specifics of how the fusion peptide interacts with the membrane is still not known. In this project, various interactions between the fusion peptide with membrane surfaces that mimic different kinds of host cells will be studied. This information will provide insight into the characteristics of both the fusion peptide and the host cell that promotes their interaction, and ultimately, infection and viral transmission to new hosts. With a better understanding of the science behind this critical interaction for virus adaptation to new hosts, we will be better informed about how this virus spreads and ultimately equipped to develop strategies to stop it. This fundamental information has the potential to enable fresh approaches to the design of antiviral drugs that target the fusion peptide. Given that the fusion peptide is highly conserved across the coronavirus family, these studies will be directly applicable to all coronaviruses, including the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.<br/><br/>A key determinant of the ability of coronavirus to spread is how it interacts with its target host membrane. For coronavirus, entry into a host cell is mediated by a single glycoprotein protruding from its membrane envelope, called spike (S). Within S, the region that directly interacts with the membrane is called the fusion peptide, FP. It is the physico-chemical interactions of the FP with the host membrane that anchors it, thus enabling the necessary deformations of the membrane that lead to delivery of the viral genome into the cell. Thus, understanding FP interactions at the most fundamental level will facilitate the development of strategies to limit those interactions to stop the spread of infections. This information is expected to be helpful in predicting the characteristics of emerging strains that could post a threat to humans in the future. The objective of this project is to measure and identify the specific intermolecular interactions responsible for insertion of FP into membranes. Specifically, this project will: 1) elucidate the factors that control hydrophobic interactions of FP using single molecule force measurements with atomic force microscopy and models of biological membranes, and 2) characterize the structure-function relationship of the FP using circular dichroism and isothermal calorimetry to correlate specific interactions with amino acid sequence and host surface properties. The intellectual merit of this project is discovering how changes in host membrane chemistry or amino acid sequence of the FP modulates the hydrophobic interaction and ultimately influences activity critical to the spread of infection. The broader impact of this project is providing information that will enable fresh approaches to the design of antiviral drugs, as well as to identify basic design rules that inform how the FP promotes the interaction with membranes of specific chemistry to predict host susceptibility to infection. Given that the FP is highly conserved across the CoV family, these studies will be directly applicable to all CoVs, including those yet to emerge.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

644	Andrew Parker	Rand Corporation	None	2020-04-01	2021-03-31	RAPID: Evolution of Public Risk Perception and Mental Models Regarding COVID-19	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - In crises such as the emergence of COVID-19, the public is a critical response partner. Novel threats are concerning to the public, but often poorly understood, with misunderstanding leading to inappropriate reactions. Clarifying when and why misperceptions occur is important because resulting behavior can contribute to disease spread, supply shortages, and unnecessary health-care system burden. Central are individual mental models, intuitive theories made up of related beliefs or perceptions individuals have about a risk, which may or may not align with scientific consensus. Mental models form a foundation for how people conceive risk, structure decisions, and their risk-related behaviors. This project follows individuals? risk perceptions, mental models, and risk behaviors over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, capitalizing on a time-sensitive opportunity to push forward the science on public risk responses to crises, within a concrete public health context. <br/><br/>The primary goal is to longitudinally track risk perceptions, mental models, and risk-related behaviors within individuals over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary goals are to develop new methodological approaches to process and analyze large-sample mental models data and engage experts on our approach and needs for larger infrastructure. The project leverages existing data and planned survey data collection, building out a longitudinal assessment to be able to capture changes in risk perceptions, mental models, and behaviors. The surveys use freelisting, a simple free-association technique from anthropology, to gather a large-sample picture of people?s risk mental models. The research team employs automated lexical analysis tools to process the data and network analytic techniques to map out the mental models. The team uses regression analysis to examine relationships among mental models, risk perceptions, behavior, and their change over time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

645	Sergei Pond	Temple University	None	2020-04-01	2021-03-31	Rapid: Collaborative Research: Agile and effective responses to emerging pathogen threats through open data and open analytics	Biological Sciences - The same types of questions arise during every emergent viral outbreak regarding its origin, its evolution, the manner of spread, and how to detect and mitigate it. Many, if not all, of these questions depend on rapid and reliable genomic analysis of diverse viral sample sequences by multiple laboratories. Early viral investigation is often impaired lack of reproducibility, rigor, and data/analytic sharing; the current investigation of COVID-19 is no different. Essential questions such as the extent of intra-host genomic variability (indicative of adaptation or multiple infection), viral evolution (selection, recombination), transmission (phylogentic and phylogeographic) cannot be answered reliably if researchers cannot trust/replicate the source data and analytical approaches. The goal of this award is to develop, deploy, and continuously update viral genomic analysis workflows to enable the analysis and monitoring of viral evolution and dynamics for SARS-CoV-2, and to use the lessons learned to prepare capacity for future outbreaks.<br/> <br/>Bioinformatics workflows for critical tasks in investigating COVID-19 and future viral outbreaks will be developed and COVID-19 deep sequencing data will be analyzed and shared openly via Galaxy and Datamonkey to facilitate and accelerate evolutionary discovery and enable the study of and response to inevitable future infectious disease outbreaks. In an age of digital connectivity, open and accessible shared data and analysis platforms have the potential to transform the way biomedical research is done, opening the way to ?global research markets?, where competition arises from deriving understanding rather than access to samples and data. By enabling any researcher with an Internet connection to perform the same analyses as are done by top-flight research groups in resource-rich countries, this award will deliver critical components to resource limited settings, which are often those that are first and disproportionately affected by viral outbreaks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

646	Alin Coman	Princeton University	None	2020-04-01	2021-03-31	RAPID: Community-wide acquisition of medical knowledge about COVID-19 under conditions of risk and uncertainty	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - The response to the COVID-19 pandemic may depend critically on how communities of individuals acquire and propagate medical information. This is especially true given the many and frequent updates of medical information transmission, treatment and containment strategies. Although the diffusion of knowledge has been studied previously, very few models incorporate psychologically grounded assumptions about knowledge search, acquisition, and propagation. Specifically, they do not fully consider (1) that information propagation is influenced by the communicative context, (2) that it is critically affected in high-anxiety, high-uncertainty environments, and (3) that results obtained in dyadic level paradigms cannot simply be extrapolated to large social networks. The integration of these advances will address three key questions: First, how does the high perceived risk of infection influence the lay public?s acquisition and propagation of medical information in social networks? Second, how do emotion, social distancing practices, and media consumption impact medical knowledge acquisition and propagation? And third, what socio-cognitive strategies could one employ to increase the spread of accurate information and to diminish the diffusion of misinformation in social networks? Findings from this study could inform the development of infrastructure and practices to better prepare the population for medical crises. <br/><br/>The COVID-19 pandemic provides an urgent opportunity to investigate the acquisition and propagation of medical knowledge in social networks under conditions of high perceived risk of viral infection. This project uses developments in cognitive psychology, social psychology, and network science to address these critical issues. This cross-disciplinary approach will relate individual-level processes to community-wide acquisition of medical knowledge. Online communities will be assembled, and individuals will engage in a sequence of networked conversations about their knowledge of COVID-19. These interactions will occur using a computer-mediated tool, SoPHIE (Software Platform for Human Interaction Experiments), that allows for seamless communication in conversational networks, designed according to experimenter-specified parameters. Individual knowledge will be measured before and after networked conversations, and the conversational network structure will be manipulated together with the threshold at which people are willing to provide and accept information from others. Advances from this project will be of interest to scientists for modeling optimal information diffusion in social networks and to public health officials interested in disseminating accurate information to the public in their efforts to save lives during times of turmoil.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

The primary goal of this Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project is to collect time-sensitive online social media and crowd-sourced data and analyze patterns of health-risk communication and community response in the emergence and spread of novel Coronavirus using data-driven methods and network science theories. The major focus will be towards understanding how individuals are socially influenced online, while communicating risk and interacting in their respective communities as the disease continues to spread. The notion of influence will be captured by quantifying the network effects on such communication behavior and characterizing how information is exchanged among people who are socially connected online and exposed to health risk in such outbreaks of disease. Given that communities responded to COVID-19 with limited or no preparation and there is uncertainty in the length of recovery for the communities already affected while new communities being threatened, the data collection effort requires rapid response for better coverage and careful monitoring. The data will include large-scale ephemeral online interactions of people in the affected communities and public officials who are involved in COVID-19 response, recovery, and mitigation efforts, followed by a data-driven network analytics and infographics of COVID-19 risk communication strategies and risk averting behaviors adopted. The proposed research will not only expand the knowledge base of spatio-temporal dynamics of risk perception and dissemination strategies in the emergence and aftermath of a major disease outbreak, but will also result in data-driven inference techniques to improve our understanding of how people express diverse concerns and how to harness and embed such information for designing intervention measures. The methodologies and findings of this rapid response research will benefit emergency management and public health agencies to define targeted information dissemination policies for public with diverse needs based on how people reacted to COVID-19 and their social network characteristics, activities, and interactions in response to similar public health hazards.<br/><br/>Public engagement in risk communication can lead to more effective decision-making and enhanced public feedback to the regulatory process. The primary goal of this RAPID project is to mine and analyze large-scale time-sensitive perishable crowd-sourced and social media data (rich spatio-temporal data) and reveal patterns of health-risk communication and community response in the emergence and spread of novel Coronavirus using data-driven methods and network science theories. The specific aims are threefold: (1) to document how public interact and communicate health risk information through their online social networks during a major disease outbreak; (2) to authenticate data from multiple sources and detect anomalies to avoid information overload and spread of misinformation; and (3) to examine how online social networks influence protective actions (e.g., social distancing, self-quarantine decisions) i.e. information cascades in health risk communication. To achieve the goal and aims, the project will utilize ephemeral time and geo-tagged social media interactions of users, agencies, news sources supplemented with crowd-sourced information on COVID-19. This study will have five theoretical and methodological contributions to the literature. It will: (1) advance our understanding of how individuals are socially influenced online, while communicating health risks and interacting in their respective communities as the disease continues to spread; (2) inform the literature on how information is exchanged among people who are socially connected online and exposed to health risk in such outbreaks of disease; (3) use novel machine-learning and network science models to quantify influence and network effects on such communication behavior; (4) capture the variability in network composition, risk communication strategies and risk averting behaviors adopted based on spatio-temporal correlations of risk and disease contagion; (5) ensure authenticity of the collected data from multiple sources and develop more accurate fully-distributed computational algorithms tailored to health risk anomaly detection in socio-technical systems. The findings from this research will be useful to public health and emergency management agencies for tailoring effective information dissemination policies for diverse user groups based on their social network characteristics, activities, and interactions in response to similar public health hazards. The methodologies, and implications of this research can be transferred in designing effective intervention policies to other natural and man-made disaster contexts in which public health risks become major concerns. The project will engage, mentor, and offer an innovative active learning environment for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students by giving priority to disadvantaged and underrepresented communities in USA. The project will train students on computational skills required for collecting, storing, processing, analyzing and modeling large-scale data using high performance computational resources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

With the rapid development of information, communication, and technologies, new data acquisition and assessment methods are needed to evaluate the risk of epidemic transmission and geographic spreading from the community perspective, to help effectively monitor social distancing policies, and to understand social disparities and environmental contexts in risk communication. This project will make theoretical, methodological, and practical contributions that advance the understanding of the COVID-19 spread across both time and space. The communication aspects of this research will serve to educate communities about the science, timing, and geography of virus transmission in order to enhance actions for addressing such global health challenges. This project explores the capabilities and potential of integrating social media big data and geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) technologies to enable and transform spatial epidemiology research and risk communication. Results will be disseminated broadly to multiple stakeholder groups. Further, this project will support both researchers and students from underrepresented groups, broadening participation in STEM fields. Lastly, the Web platform developed in this project will serve as an education tool for students in geography, communication, mathematics, and public health, as well as for effectively engaging with communities about the science of COVID-19. <br/><br/>Past health research mainly focuses on quantitative modeling of human transmission using various epidemic models. How to effectively communicate the science of an epidemic outbreak to the general public remains a challenge. When an epidemic outbreak occurs without specific controls in place, it can be particularly challenging to improve community risk awareness and action. The research team, composed of experts from geography, mathematics, public health and life sciences communication will (1) develop innovative mathematical predictive models that integrate spatio-temporal-social network information and community-centered approaches; (2) integrate census statistics, human mobility and social media big data, as well as policy controls to conduct data-synthesis-driven and epidemiology-guided risk analysis; And (3) utilize panel surveys and text mining techniques on social media data for better understanding public awareness of COVID-19 and for investigating various instant message and visual image strategies to effectively communicate about risks to the public. The results of this project will lead to a better understanding of the geography and spread of COVID-19. Additionally, it is expected that the methods developed in this project can be applied to mitigate the outbreak risks of future epidemics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

This research investigates how to measure changes in collective movement of people in response to the fast-evolving COVID-19 outbreak using large datasets of passively collected location data. It examines how locations within a state respond to public policy implementation and times of critical public messaging. Detailed knowledge on movement patterns of people can help public officials identify hotspots and critically isolated populations, as well as shed light on those groups who continue to travel for work or other purposes. This research contributes to improving the public response to an emergency and contributes to bridging different stakeholder mitigation strategies.<br/><br/>Detailed knowledge of how people respond to a fast-spreading global pandemic is very limited and our understanding of these responses is mostly for small areas. This research will use a near real-time location-based dataset passively collected through the use of location-based apps during the period of pandemic. The project will develop scalable, big location-based algorithms to extract trips and examine the evolution of mobility patterns throughout the pandemic, and identify different mobility patterns. We will develop map-reduce based distributed algorithms to scale up mobility measure calculations based on the big location-based data as well as develop entropy measures to capture the time-varying characteristics associated with the travel patterns, and design strategies to correct biases that may be present in the location data. The methods and results of this research will be useful for understanding mobility during other hazards that affect communities, such as severe flooding to understand how travel is changed as a result of imperatives stemming from both the hazard and policy directives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

However, China has been particularly hit with over 70 000 confirmed cases, of which about 80% are in Hubei province. Wuhan, capital city of Hubei, is considered ground zero of the outbreak. Testing is typically performed at centralized facilities with highly qualified personnel operating specialized equipment, RT-qPCR being the current method of choice and DNA sequencing a second choice. The response time between sampling patients and obtaining clinically relevant information usually depends on sample shipping time and clinical lab capacity. In this current outbreak containment situation in China, large portions of the population are quarantined, travel is restricted, and clinical labs are operating well over capacity. We propose to develop a rapid point-of-care test to help mitigate the outbreak of COVID-19. The RNA-based test will be performed with a high sensitivity, label-free sensing method. RNA purification and amplification will not be required. The instrumentation needed will be portable and lightweight to enable frontline workers to rapidly test for SARS-CoV-2. The assay will be developed with an easy-to-use platform that can be operated by untrained personnel. It can thereby be deployed locally, within regions of quarantine at a temporary health centers and neighbourhood clinics, reducing flow of people in urban centers; it can be shipped and used in remote or isolated areas including cruise ships	Canadian Institutes of Health Research	Research Grant	1000000.0 CAD

At University Health Network, our team represents a deeply experienced group of critical care doctors and infectious disease researchers who can immediately respond to the global need to provide an accurate diagnosis of respiratory illness-the main feature of COVID-19-at the front lines of patient care. We have recently developed a 40 minute diagnostic test to determine lung quality for transplantation. Recent scientific studies from China clearly show that the body's development of respiratory distress as a response to potential COVID-19 infection produces an identical injury profile that would be detected by our diagnostic test. We will work alongside SQI Diagnostics, our Canadian partner committed to developing diagnostics for lung health, to adapt our test towards the development of RALI-Dx (Rapid Acute Lung Injury Diagnostic). This diagnostic can be used by hospital emergency departments to screen for lung sickness and the likelihood of COVID-19 infection. An important part of our CIHR-supported research study is a commitment from our Chinese collaborators to safely test our diagnostic first on COVID-19+ blood samples to make sure the test is highly accurate before hospital use. With our 40 minute RALI-Dx test, we will: -Quickly identify the highest risk patients in need of immediate care -Identify lower risk patients who require at-home monitoring -Reduce the current major stress on health care facilities Additionally, new COVID-19 therapies are being rapidly developed around the world, and the first step will be to identify which patients will benefit the most from these treatments. With RALI-Dx, hospitals everywhere can better manage patient care and provide an accelerated response to the COVID-19 outbreak.	Canadian Institutes of Health Research	Research Grant	970702.0 CAD

The recent outbreak of the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic clearly demonstrates how in today's age infectious agents can spread rapidly. Given the ability of individuals to travel across the globe infectious agents can reach pandemic/epidemic proportions quickly, as seen with SARS and MERS outbreaks. Such viral agents become infectious because of genetic alterations many times occurring in other animals and eventually can infect humans. There are no effective anti-viral agents nor have vaccines been developed. Thus during these outbreaks we can only rely on infection control measures. Such measures help control the spread of the disease but is dependent on verifying individuals who are infected and those who are not infected. Presently diagnosing COVID-19 infections is inadequate as the laboratory tests may take 24-48 hrs to be completed. Such time periods make infection control very difficult. In this proposal we discuss how a rapid testing and diagnosis be made in the order of minutes. We have developed a revolutionary methodology that would construct a diagnostic device which is small and portable, and even be battery operated. Our device would be a true point of care platform that would be used at the "first contact" between patient and health professional. Our point of care testing platform would give rapid result in minutes and would help enormously in infection control management of not only the current COVID-19 outbreaks but also future pathogenic viral outbreaks which are surely to happen.

It first emerged from the city of Wuhan in Hubei in December 2019 and has since spread widely in China and to more than 24 counties globally. The virus has been declared as a deadly global threat, and accelerated international efforts have been engaged to control the virus. A total of 1,524 deaths been confirmed as of 15th February 2020 (WHO). As a result of the rapid transmission internationally, a global call to control the spread of the virus in affected and non-affected areas has been implemented. Currently, there is no effective treatment or vaccine to control the virus. Symptoms of the infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, and shortness of breath. In more severe cases, the infection can cause respiratory failure, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and death. The objectives of this application are 1) to develop antibodies that will block the entrance of the virus into the cells, and to test the efficacy of these antibodies in mice.

655	Michael James	University of Alberta	None	None	None	Towards anti-COVID-19 therapeutic development by targeting the viral papain-like proteinase	When positive-stranded RNA viruses such as the causative agent for the 2019-2020 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak enter an infectious cycle in the cell, their RNA genomes hijack the host cell's protein production machinery to mass produce large continuous viral polyproteins in a process called translation. In order to make progeny viruses, these viral polypeptides need to be processed into smaller, individually functional protein programmed to perform specific tasks, e.g., replicating the RNA genome, assembling the protein coat for progeny viruses, packing the newly synthesized RNA genome into the assembled viral capsid, and subverting or disabling the host cell's antiviral defense mechanisms. Two virally encoded proteinases, the papain-like (PL) and the 3C-like (3CL) proteinases, carry out the job of "clipping" the viral polypeptides into individual viral proteins. The PL is translated before the 3CL hence it likely takes precedence in performing "cuts" in the polyprotein, releasing an initial batch of viral proteins to mount the first wave of suppressive attack on antiviral host defense. In addition, coronavirus PL directly participates in preventing type I interferon activation, an important step leading to antiviral defense. Last but not the least, PL1 is part of non-structural protein 3 (NSP3), which is an indispensable component of the membranous complex where viral RNA genome is replicated. Taken together, PL of the novel coronavirus makes a good antiviral target for the development of therapeutics. Inhibiting PL would not only halt viral protein and RNA production at an early stage but would also help restore host antiviral defense. In this proposal, we seek to solve the 3-dimensional structure of SARS-CoV-2 PL and then use the structural knowledge to aid our search of small molecules that can inhibit the functions of PL. We will work with our collaborators to optimize the top inhibitors and test these inhibitors in cell and animal infection models.	Canadian Institutes of Health Research	Research Grant	311000.0 CAD

Lab data, animal models and early clinical data suggest that a drug commonly used to treat HIV, called Kaletra, may have activity against COVID-19 and its closely related "cousin" coronaviruses, SARS and MERS. Kaletra is currently being tested in clinical trials in China for treatment. This drug has been safely used for over two decades in HIV treatment and also in post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for un-infected people with high-risk exposures. We propose a study that will address the immediate need for prevention interventions by testing whether or not giving Kaletra PEP to contacts exposed to COVID-19 will stop them from getting the disease. We expect to test this in three key groups of exposed contacts: the frail elderly in nursing/retirement homes, frontline health workers, and household/community contacts. Our trial employs a commonly used approach in vaccination studies called a ring design, which also allows us to collect detailed information about the natural history of the infection in exposed contacts. In addition to testing the effectiveness of our specific intervention, the master protocols and procedures developed can be used to test other prevention interventions including both medications and vaccines, once they become available. This ring design was a key part of the successful eradication of smallpox, and the evaluation of the vaccine used for Ebola. We will identify a ring of exposed close contacts around index cases and randomize these rings to a 14-day course of Kaletra PEP or a placebo control and will test contacts systematically to see if they develop COVID-19. Our study team members of Canadian experts on the frontlines with SARS, MERS, H1N1, Ebola, and HIV, are well connected to coordinate with existing clinical trials networks both in Canada and internationally.

657	Mélissa Genereux	Université de Sherbrooke	None	None	None	The role of communication strategies and media discourse in shaping psychological and behavioral response to the COVID-19 outbreak: a comparative analysis between Canada and two Asian countries/regions	First identified in December 2019 in China, the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a "Public Health Emergency of International Concern" by the World Health Organization (WHO). Large outbreaks can increase the sense of fear and lead to adverse responses from the public, such as denial, rumors, misconceptions, stigmatization, and avoidance behaviors. Both news media and social media play a major role shaping these responses. Little is known about how people of various cultural and social backgrounds react to health information and misinformation. It is also unclear how official information (from the authorities) flows and circulates across levels of governance (from WHO to countries, then from countries to citizens). Our research project aims to contribute to a better understanding of how the health information related to the COVID-19 outbreak is delivered by authorities and media, and how it is received, understood and used by the public. To do so, we will conduct a survey about knowledge, perceptions, and reactions to the COVID-19 outbreak among large and representative samples of the population in three places: Canada, Hong Kong and Philippines. We will also analyze and compare the way information about COVID-19 outbreak is shared in the news media and the social media. Finally, we will look at how health information delivered and received by the population is influenced by the multiple levels of governance. This international research project will allow to 1) evaluate the impacts of communication strategy and misinformation on populations of various backgrounds and 2) draw important lessons that could be applied to future disasters and global threats.

658	Shelby Yamamoto	University of Alberta	None	None	None	Assessing and addressing the psychosocial impacts of COVID-19 among pregnant women and health care providers in Anhui, China	On January 31, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. In addition to focusing on immediate clinical/biomedical needs relat-ed to the outbreak, it is also important to consider potential mental health impacts. Pregnancy can be a time of heightened vulnerability, especially during public health emergencies. Women may have several concerns related to: their health and fetus; the health of family, friends, and their infants; access to ser-vices; potential exposure during hospital deliveries; and social isolation, among others. Health care pro-viders (HCPs) also face mental, physical, and social challenges that can affect their wellbeing and ability to care for patients. Building on our team's existing research work and infrastructure, we will first assess the potential impacts of the COVID-19 emergency on pregnant women's mental health (depression) and the implementation of a perinatal depression and screening and management program in Ma'anshan, Chi-na. Secondly, we will then evaluate the effect of a cognitive behavioral therapy intervention aimed at re-ducing depression in pregnant women and investigate changes in the acceptability of and adherence to the intervention. Thirdly, we will investigate potential impacts in terms of adverse birth outcomes (preterm birth, low birth weight, small for gestational age) and explore women's experiences during the outbreak. Fourthly, we also plan to assess anxiety among HCPs and investigate the provision of perinatal health care during and after the emergency. This study aims to contribute to the global COVID-19 response, foster our understanding of the potential mental health impacts of the emergency, reduce public health risk and burden, and help inform clinical and public health responses to the outbreak.

659	Kate A Zinszer	Université de Montréal	None	None	None	A multi-country comparison of COVID-19 response: Planning, implementation, and health system resilience	The many unknowns of COVID-19 have made the response efforts difficult despite the rapid guidance provided by the WHO. How different countries respond to this pandemic in their preparation and implementation is essential to study and understand. The aim of this project is to compare the public health response to COVID-19 in Brazil, Canada, France, and Mali. Use a case study approach, we will identify strengths and weaknesses in the response, including challenges for health professionals and health systems. To achieve our project aim, we will first document how countries have planned, organized, and implemented public health responses. We will also examine the role of scientific, empirical, and experiential information used in the response planning. We will also study health system vulnerability according to exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacities. We will then generate lessons learned for the benefit of public health and health systems and we will organize a workshop between the four countries and international organizations. . Data sources for this study include key stakeholder interviews with decision makers and practitioners, organizational charts providing health human resource data, internal documentation indicating measures taken and dates implemented (e.g., emergency operations center activation, quarantine), and preparedness plans. The research team is composed of international and national experts in epidemic response and health systems analysis from each of the four countries. It is a multidisciplinary team of infectious disease clinicians, social scientists, public health practitioners, epidemiologists, data scientists, and a knowledge transfer expert. Our team includes decision makers and knowledge partners who are key to ensuring our work remains relevant and also provides an important conduit for the uptake of policy and practices recommendations.

A particular dimension that is under-explored and researched is the impact that infectious outbreaks have on the risk perception of cancer patients, including those who are at increased risk of developing infections due to their treatments and immunocompromised state. Furthermore, in the era of continuous and rapid news reporting, social media, and messaging platforms, the proliferation and distribution of COVID-2019 content is unprecedented and further driving distress among this group of patients and caregivers who need to visit medical instituions at regular intervals. At Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center Odette Cancer Center in Toronto, Ontario, we have seen an unprecedented number of clinic appointment cancellations due to fears of being exposed to COVID-2019 given we were the first Canadian institution to confirm a patient infected with COVID-2019. Therefore, to better understand this phenomenon, we have designed a research proposal to address this under explored area in order to develop educational tools to help patients and their families/caregivers make informed decisions based on the true risks during this outbreak with appropriate levels of concern and mitigation. We expect these education interventions to empower patients and families/caregivers on the true risks of COVID-2019 infection and in turn prevent inappropriate clinic cancellations and sub-optimal care for patients undergoing treatment for cancer.

Particular emphasis will be given to HIV-infected individuals. The aims will be achieved through the implementation of shedding and household transmission studies, collection of sequential serum samples, enhanced facility-based (hospitals and clinics) surveillance among patients with mild and severe respiratory illness in well-established population-based surveillance sites where incidence can be calculated, and healthcare utilization and serological surveys in selected communities. In addition, digital surveillance (based on Google searches) will be used to complement virological surveillance and nowcasting and short-term forecasting (up to 4 weeks) will be implemented over the duration of the epidemic.

662	Prof. Teresa Lambe	The University of Oxford	None	None	None	Investigation of pre-existing immunity to coronaviruses; implications for immunopathology and pathophysiology of COVID-19 disease	Background; It is unknown how prior exposure to commonly circulating human coronaviruses (HCoV) impacts immunity against highly-pathogenic species (SARS, SARS-CoV-2 & MERS). There are limited data, across Europe, Asia and Africa, on the prevalence of infection and seroconversion against widely circulating and mildly symptomatic HCoVs (229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1). There is a current supposition that antibody-dependent-enhancement (ADE) may play a role in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. ADE occurs when non-neutralizing antiviral proteins facilitate virus entry into host cells, leading to increased infectivity in the cells. In such cases, higher viremia has been measured and the clinical course of disease can be more severe. In preclinical animal models, immunopathology was observed after challenge following vaccination with some SARS vaccines. Therefore, concerns have been raised regarding the impact of immunopathology and ADE on prophylactic vaccination against SARS and possibly SARS-CoV-2. Goals: to perform detailed systems serology of pre-existing immunity, in children and adults, from the UK and Africa, towards novel and commonly circulating coronaviruses. Impact: These studies highlight the limited knowledge in the field and a need for a systematic approach to investigate cross-reactive humoral immunity against HCoV to inform the immunopathology and pathophysiology of COVID-19.

The African MRC Units have a criticalrole to play in researching the epidemic but also in supporting local health systems in thisresponse. In Uganda, diagnostic capacity is to our knowledge currently limited to theUganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI, Entebbe) and Central Public Health Laboratories(CPHL, Kampala). Given the rapid spread of the virus globally, there is a high risk the first positivecases will be detected in Uganda over the next few weeks.Lessons learnt from other countries suggest that the ability to rapidly diagnose SARS-CoV-2positive samples is critical in controlling the pandemic. However, given the pace of virusspread seen in Asia, Europe and the US, the local diagnostic capacity will need to beincreased substantially to handle the anticipated increase in suspected cases. The Unit haswell-trained laboratory staff, robust procedures and excellent facilities which could supportthe national effort to prevent and contain an outbreak in Uganda.Support Capacity:The Unit intends to prepare for supporting the national diagnostic capacity by offering up to2,500 tests per month over the next 4 months. Full virus genome sequences would begenerated from a subset of positive samples, the resulting data would support theinternational effort in understanding the regional movement of the virus and would monitorfor virus changes that might influence diagnostics or the pathology of the virus.

The recent pandemic highlights this, as well as the need for methods to determine timely decisions for strategic interventions that reduce the impact of the pandemic on populations. Use of network traffic models account for flow of the disease via carriers from the initial source of the pandemic and between centers of infections, and addresses the long-distance spread of the disease. Non-medical solutions that immediately attempt to reduce the spread of pandemic include intra-city restrictions and inter-city strategies that involve suppression of population transfer. Critical actions include decisions on the level of suppression, the routes over which suppression has to be applied, and the time at which it has to be applied. Reducing the mitigation or suppression must critically account for the re-occurrence of the disease. The level of suppression has economic consequences with immediate and potential long term impacts on employment and economic growth, and can run counter to maintaining essential services such as food distribution, medical facilities, and first responders. This project will develop novel techniques to analyze pandemic models and design new optimization algorithms that provide decision strategies, accounting for costs, including the economic costs of suppression. This research has time urgency as there is a need for strategic analysis in the current pandemic and the project will utilize timely insights from the data available. Additionally, the insights will assist in determining decision strategies for future occurrences.<br/><br/>This RAPID project will identify and refine network models of pandemic spread using a hierarchical model that incorporates the traffic network between major cities and countries at the first level. The subsequent levels will utilize local traffic networks and mobility patterns in centers of large populations. The models will include (i) subdivision of populations into classes that represent the current state of the pandemic, examples being population sets that are susceptible, infected, suppressed and recovered, all parameterized by time, (ii) multiple source and destination network flow models of infection flow, and (iii) geographic models of infection spread in local population clusters. This project will apply optimization techniques and network analysis to analyze the models and design algorithms for determining decision strategies. Evolution of the population sets, as modeled by differential equations solved using numerical methods and discrete analogs, will be investigated. Methods to determine parameters that regulate the transfer rates between populations will be designed. The model will be used to define mathematical programs in order to optimize decision parameters that include the level of suppression and the time at which to relax suppression. Network flow techniques will be used to minimize the flow of infection with multiple key objectives, especially to minimize the peak levels of the spread.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

676	Gholamali Rahnavard	George Washington University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: A novel platform for data integration and deep learning on COVID-19	Biological Sciences - The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has fundamentally changed the world, and yet its ultimate impact is unknown. While China has experienced a slowdown in new cases, infections in the US continue to rise and are threatening to exceed our health care system?s capacity. Tests capacities are limited compared to the need, hospital services are becoming overwhelmed, and critical supplies are in shortage. There is a diversity of efforts currently ongoing to develop both new treatments as well as vaccine strategies to combat COVID-19. Yet, we know from experience, the virus will evolve solutions to both host immune systems and intervention strategies. In order to diminish both the short-term and long-term impacts of COVID-19, it is essential to develop robust, repeatable, and accessible tools to integrate and analyze the diversity of data becoming available in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. The development of a platform to characterize the dynamic nature of mutations in the virus and testing for associations with clinical variables and biomarkers is an essential broader impact and will help in making informed predictions of health outcomes such as the stage of the severity of the disease and efficacy of treatment. Additionally, this project provides professional development opportunities for early career researchers.<br/><br/>Advances in omics technologies provide a broad and deep range of genotypic and phenotypic data to integrate with clinical phenotypes. Machine learning techniques such as clustering using phylogenetic distance and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are suitable techniques to link these DNA level changes to clinical metadata for human disease prediction, diagnosis, and therapeutics. This project develops tools within an open-source platform for documented, repeatable analyses that can be conducted in real-time allowing integration of data from patients with new treatments/vaccines strategies. This deep learning bioinformatics platform will allow the prioritization of genes associated with outcome predictors, including health, therapeutic, and vaccine outcomes, as well as inform improved DNA tests for predicting disease status and severity. The computational tools developed in this study will provide the research community and health professionals with comprehensive and generic approaches for characterizing the dynamics of genotype/phenotype associations in viruses. Such tools allow healthcare professionals and researchers to address specific properties of viruses such as frequency and location of mutations across the viral genome. When added to other clinical and epidemiological data, such information could help pave the way to better treatments or a vaccine. The developed platform will provide a venue for robust, open, repeatable analyses of COVID-19 as more and more data become available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

677	Sherry Pagoto	University of Connecticut	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Exploring Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Undergraduate STEM Education by Student Gender, Race/Ethnicity, and Socioeconomic Status	Education and Human Resources - The COVID-19 pandemic presents unprecedented challenges to undergraduate education. Although the disruption affects the entire academic community, the impacts are not equal. For example, students with low socioeconomic status, first generation students, and women may be affected more strongly by the disruptions than other students. Thus, based on students? demographics, the pandemic may be more likely or less likely to exacerbate existing or create new differential impacts on students. This study seeks to investigate this likely unequal impact among a large sample of students enrolled in calculus courses in spring 2020. A survey will gather student voices by probing how this disaster has affected students in STEM career pathways. The survey needs to be conducted immediately to gather the information from the students as they experience the disruption in their collegiate education. <br/><br/>The goal of this study is to conduct a timely mixed-methods study to collect data from a representative sample of undergraduate STEM students from varied backgrounds. The data will include the student voice about their experiences including: 1) the transition away from campus; 2) the challenges experienced; 3) the degree to which challenges affected attendance, academic performance, withdrawal rates, and college dropout rates; and 4) factors that facilitated success or failure among among all students, including underresourced and underrepresented students. After gathering data via the survey, the project team will facilitate 15 focus groups of about six students, balanced by socioeconomic status, race or ethnicity, and gender. Using a socioecological framework, the project team will analyze factors across multiple levels, ranging from the individual to public policy, and use the survey and focus group data to develop a quantitative survey. This work represents novel STEM-education research in an urgent and unique context. The findings may immediately inform interventions to address the needs of current undergraduate STEM students in the US. Formal reports and recommendations that arise will be published and disseminated in Fall 2020 and Spring 2021. In the longer term, results may inform evidence-based recommendations regarding distance versus on-campus learning for students, including students from underresourced and underrepresented backgrounds.

This study is intended to produce additional insights on how such learning is shaped by equity concerns and contextual factors. For example, researchers will document how the ways in which people learn the science of COVID-19 are mediated by the sources of information they have access to and leverage, as well as what supports them in doing so. The research will further document how people leverage their understandings of COVID-19, alongside other forms of knowledge and concerns in their decision-making. This study may serve a crucial role in aiding the public understanding of where structural points of informational failure might occur. It may also reveal where and how the public engages or resists community action strategies to mitigate spread and suffering through when, how and why they gather, share, and make sense of scientific data. This RAPID was submitted in response to the NSF Dear Colleague letter related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This award is made by the AISL and ECR programs in the Division of Research on Learning, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. <br/><br/>This research will draw upon a conceptual framework of consequential learning and a methodological framework of narrative inquiry. Sixty participants in Lansing, Michigan and Seattle, Washington will participate over the course of one year in cyclical interviews, focus group conversations and experience sampling approaches. Documents and resources named and used by the participants in their learning will be collected and analyzed. Attention will be paid to science learning in the following areas as the primary focus: a) the science of SARS-CoV-2 and the relationship between virus and disease, b) viral transmission, and c) origination, replication and spread. A key focus will also be how people use scientific data and evidence-based explanations when developing understandings and making decisions with respect to the pandemic. This research is urgent and timely because the COVID-19 pandemic is projected to occur in multiple waves over approximately 18 months. Insights may produce basic understanding about rapid science learning, policy strategies, school-based practices and resources for use within current and future waves. Socioscientific crises differentially impact people, with effects felt more significantly by vulnerable people. Thus, this study will address the urgent call for investigation into factors and experiences of low-income individuals and families who are trying to educate themselves on continually changing data during an international health crisis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

679	Jacqueline Griffin	Northeastern University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Rapid Monitoring and Assessment of Critical Pharmaceutical Supply Chains	Engineering - Over the past decade, the U.S. has persistently experienced significant therapeutic drug shortages, jeopardizing patient care and diminishing economic prosperity due to increased healthcare costs. The current COVID-19 epidemic threatens to overwhelm hospital supplies of medicines and therapeutics in large urban centers as part of the first wave of infections across the country. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that effective medicines to treat COVID-19 disease are currently under development or in testing phases, resulting in very limited supplies. This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) grant will collect useful, time-sensitive data related to operations of hospital pharmacies as they dispense these critical therapeutics during the pandemic. The analysis of these data will provide insight into the pharmaceutical supply networks with the goal of breaking the cycle of repeated and recurrent shortages, as pointed out in the FDA's Drug Shortage Task Force's report in 2019. <br/><br/>The PIs will collect quantitative and qualitative information on the inventories and distribution of available and emerging therapeutics to document the allocation of scarce medicines to hospital patients in a large urban hospital system. Quantitative data on demand and supply (physicians' orders, current and forecast inventory levels, available suppliers, prices, etc.) will be collected through a collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital and OrbitalRx, an online pharmaceutical exchange platform. In addition, qualitative information will be collected from pharmacists' notes and interviews with pharmacy personnel that documents the decision-making processes and workflows associated with allocating scarce therapeutics resources to critically ill patients suffering from COVID-19. The research is expected to help identify gaps in information flows and decision-support models that are most critical for the management of drug shortages under extreme circumstances.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

However, existing network throughput measurement (speed test) platforms are often not representative of the performance of cloud-based applications due to the location of test servers. Measuring the performance of interconnections between cloud platforms and Internet Service Providers (cloud-ISP links) is a critical missing piece to understanding user-experienced performance of cloud-based videoconferencing applications.<br/><br/>This project will design and deploy novel experiments to measure network congestion of cloud-ISP links, tracking evolution of performance degradations during mandatory sheltering-in-place orders, and as large segments of the U.S. work force transition back to their workplaces. This scientific measurement project will tackle three challenges: 1) strategic selection of test servers within residential access and transit ISPs, based on topology measurements and analytics, 2) scientific characterization of the algorithms and behavior of speed tests, and 3) correct interpretation measurement results. The experiments will leverage speed test servers deployed by various commercial platforms (e.g., Ookla) as vantage points to conduct throughput measurements from cloud platforms hosting high-bandwidth applications. Operationalizing this experiment will provide longitudinal data to analyze performance degradation of cloud-ISP interconnections.<br/><br/>This research will enable studying the performance and reliability of critical Internet infrastructures in the U.S. during this pandemic, by collecting and sharing data that sheds light on the quality of experience of cloud-based telework applications. Visualized data will be generated to provide longitudinal views of network performance, and identify performance degradations at fine granularity, geographically and topologically. The resulting tools and methods will help guide future infrastructure improvements, and advance the ability to monitor an increasing critical communications ecosystem.<br/><br/>Detail information and the data of this project is available at https://webspeedtest.caida.org.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Due to the novelty of the virus and the speed at which it is currently sweeping the world, not only is there very little known about the virus but there is also very little data. Despite the lack of data, there are many important questions that need to be answered. Is social distancing working effectively in `flattening the curve?? How much more effective would mandated shelter-in-place be in containing the spread? Is it worth the social cost? What is the effect of 10% of the population ignoring these protocols? What is the marginal benefit of enforcing quarantines versus implementation cost? Today the important questions seem to be related to mitigation as the biggest concern is the immediate matter at hand: the impending peak of hospitalizations due to COVID-19. However, it is also necessary to be looking ahead to a potential resurgence of this virus with a new set of questions. What will be the effect of asynchronously `opening up' different parts of the country as people are still recovering from COVID-19? How will we know we are not lifting restrictions pre-maturely? Precise answers to these questions are needed in order to make informed policy decisions, and this requires a deep understanding and accurate models of COVID-19 which are simply not available today. Unfortunately, there is no time to learn about this virus before needing to act to mitigate the tremendous damage that is already being incurred socially, economically, and even in terms of lost lives. Instead, new data must be rapidly incorporated into models and these questions must be re-visited on a constant basis to be able to quickly provide at least a reasonable understanding of the important questions above.<br/><br/>This project addresses the rapidly evolving modeling problem for COVID-19. Taking a systems point of view, this project seeks to investigate the effects of various overlooked artifacts of COVID-19 in the leading models used to inform policy decisions today. The numerical methods and mathematical models can provide significant complementary support to the epidemiologists worldwide on understanding how the virus spreads. The outcomes of this project will be novel stochastic and deterministic networked meta-population models as opposed to the commonly seen lumped population models. The models developed will expand simple Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) models to capture a number of different properties specific to COVID-19 by adding more compartments. These models will provide a more rigorous analysis of the network effects of the ongoing pandemic which may prove especially useful as different parts of the country, or even the world, are imposing/lifting various levels of mobility restrictions at different times.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

These changes in behavior are placing extraordinary demands on the Internet. This project will measure the Internet?s ability to meet these demands, including comparing its performance before, during, and after the peak of COVID-19; whether the amount of change varies between areas heavily impacted by COVID-19 and those less impacted; and whether and how large networks adapt.<br/><br/>To provide this rich understanding, this project will combine multiple Internet-scale datasets that provide complementary views to investigate how responses to COVID-19 have impacted the Internet and how networks have reacted. Specifically, the project will measure how workloads have changed and their impact on networks in response to COVID-19 by measuring traffic patterns worldwide and the impact of congestion on performance globally. In addition, the project will measure how networks react to these changes in workloads by monitoring path changes that indicate rerouting of traffic during surges induced by measures in response to COVID-19, identifying whether traffic management is deployed for (de)prioritizing certain network flows, and measuring whether networks add interconnections and upgrade capacity. <br/><br/>Measuring the network impact of COVID-19 will illuminate the Internet?s strengths and weak points and is a crucial step towards improving the Internet?s future resilience in the face of pandemics, natural disasters, large scale conflict, and terrorist attacks. The Internet is designed for resiliency, but large cloud and content providers have been avoiding public Internet exchange points and the public Internet in favor of private interconnection and private wide-area networks. This project will understand the impact of these decisions. The relative performance of these strategies under stress should play a critical role in informing future research, funding, and design of critical Internet infrastructure. <br/><br/>All of the data, measurement tools, and analysis code used for this study will be published to the greatest extent permitted by our affiliated organizations and prevailing data privacy regulations, with links to these artifacts posted at<br/>https://covid19-internet-resilience.github.io/. The goal is to keep these artifacts publicly available in perpetuity via free storage and cloud repositories, though the duration is subject to the availability of such resources. The tools and code will be maintained for as long as they remain useful for measuring Internet resilience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Currently the US death toll is nearing 30,000 and estimates exceeding a hundred thousand fatalities if the spread of the virus continues unchecked. Public health interventions including strict shelter in place rules have been put in place across the US and globally to limit the spread of the virus through communities. This has had a dramatic impact on the economy, with millions of people becoming unemployed in the immediate aftermath of the interventions. The goal of this RAPID project is to develop the science for rapid assessment of how public health interventions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are impacting the environment, human behavior, and the wellbeing of the public. This goal will be achieved through detailed characterization of various biomarkers of environmental health and wellbeing in wastewater collected in the service area of people living in Tempe, Arizona. The information collected will be available to city officials, other community stakeholders, and the public using an online platform for emergency response. The resources developed in this project will inform the Nation of the impacts of shelter in place and assist crisis management and decision makers in managing these interventions.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to employ detailed high-resolution analysis of wastewater together with geospatial modeling to develop a rapid assessment of environmental health at the community level during the mandated health interventions in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic. The study will take place in Tempe, Arizona, a city of 185,000 people. Baseline data on environmental quality and human behavior and health have been collected by the research team for the past two years leading up to the pandemic. A transdisciplinary team consisting of an environmental engineer, a virologist, and a bioinformatician will study environmental and human health impacts associated with the global pandemic and the public health interventions implemented in the city in response to the outbreak using this unique data resource. Urban wastewater will be sampled daily during the shelter in place intervention for analysis of a broad spectrum of compounds and biomarkers using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Analyses include the types and quantities of air pollutants, medications taken as a result of fever and viral infections (e.g., ibuprofen), allergy suppressants, stimulants and depressants (such as nicotine and alcohol), drugs of abuse, dietary markers (indicating potential food shortages), and general biomarkers suggestive of human wellbeing and health status (e.g., antidepressants). US census data will enable an interpretation of study findings using demographics and population-size data relevant for crisis management and evidence-based decision making by scientists, city planners, mayors, health agencies, healthcare providers, and policy makers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) will investigate methods that integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI), data science, and automatic data capture technologies to design supply mechanisms that effectively deliver therapeutic medicines to underserved urban communities that are particularly vulnerable to this this disease. While few reliable therapeutic treatments are currently available, as medicines and ultimately a vaccine are developed, the challenge will be to create an effective delivery mechanism to support urban communities. Because hospitals are expected to operate at capacity treating only the most severe cases, these new supply chains will focus on the home as point-of-care. The project represents a collaboration between the PI and the City of Houston Department of Health and Human Services (HDHHS) which currently supports the city's hospital districts, the veterans? administration, and neighborhood healthcare centers. The supply chain models investigated in this project are expected to have wide applicability to similar large urban environments across the nation.<br/><br/>This EAGER award supports fundamental research in technology-enabled supply chain design to effectively deliver therapeutics to at risk populations in an urban setting. The research has three primary objectives: 1) investigate the Automated Data Capture and Artificial Intelligence needed to automate the COVID-19 Healthcare Supply Chain; 2) model the COVID-19 Supply Chain from manufacture to home delivery that addresses the needs of at risk populations and communities; and 3) identify the readiness and the societal cost benefit of this model for use when medicine and supplies become ready for the COVID-19 outbreak Available data from HDHHS on location of vulnerable individuals and their social determinants of health will be integrated in an optimization-driven AI engine to target, map and assist health departments to prioritize their limited resources for response planning and to adapt their tactics to the needs of neighborhoods and communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

685	Amy Pickering	Tufts University	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	RAPID: The role of fomites in community transmission of SARS-CoV-2	Engineering - The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 is responsible for the global pandemic of COVID-19. There is an urgent need for better tools to monitor the transmission of SARS-CoV2. Surface sampling of community surfaces holds promise as a tool to identify how transmission is occurring. While most studies are focused on SARS-CoV2 in hospitals and other clinical settings, this project will focus on monitoring SARS-CoV2 on surfaces in community settings. This will be achieved by tracking SARS-CoV2 on crosswalk buttons, doors, grocery cart handles, gas pump handles, ATM interfaces, and other surfaces that are most likely to be contaminated. Results will be assessed to determine whether surface sampling can be used to rapidly and cost-effectively gauge the effectiveness of outbreak control measures. If successful, this research will allow the prioritization of surfaces for disinfection during the SARS-CoV2 outbreak. Combining the results with environmental modeling will help identify the risk of SARS-CoV2 infection in public spaces during the epidemic and once intervention efforts are relaxed.<br/><br/>SARS-CoV2 transmission has been more difficult to control than previous outbreaks of human coronaviruses. This is thought to result from the high proportion of asymptomatic cases (up to 60%) actively shedding the virus. Infected community members can shed SARS-CoV2 onto surfaces up to a week before developing serious symptoms and can continue shedding the virus during and after disease progression. Recent evidence suggests viable SARS-CoV2 particles can survive on stainless steel and plastic surfaces for up to three days. The goal of this project is to better understand environmental transmission of SARS-CoV2 through contact with contaminated surfaces. This will be achieved through the following specific objectives: 1) Characterize the presence and concentration of SARS-CoV2 over time on high touch fomites in public locations during an outbreak; 2) Determine whether the presence or concentration of SARS-CoV2 on fomites over time is associated with public health control measures and changes in community infection rate; 3) Use SARS-CoV2 concentration data generated in this study in conjunction with transmission efficiency of viral particles to determine risk of infection from fomites. Given that more than half of infections may be asymptomatic, any recurrence may not be detected through typical hospital-based surveillance until transmission is already widespread in the community. Results will be used to assess whether changes in outbreak control strategies over the study period impact environmental concentrations of SARS-CoV2. A major concern is that lifting control measures too rapidly or ineffectively could cause a rapid increase in new infections. Results will benefit society by informing decisions on how best to control and monitor COVID-19 and future outbreaks of other enveloped viruses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

686	Julius Lucks	Northwestern University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Point-of-Need Detection of COVID-19 using CRISPR-Enabled Cell-Free Synthetic Biology	Biological Sciences - The COVID-19 pandemic highlights a limitation of laboratory-based testing for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in that it does not scale with a sudden and dramatic increase in volume. Laboratory tests, often based on quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), require equipment, time, expertise and infrastructure, resulting in severe logistical challenges and ultimately resulting in inadequate testing. There is a critical need for diagnostics that can be rapidly deployed at the point-of-need (PON) to enable global surveillance of infectious diseases. Towards addressing this need, this project incorporates a new CRISPR-based approach called CRISPR Isothermal Amplification (CIA) that enables one-pot diagnostic amplification and detection of the SARC-CoV-2 virus at ambient temperatures. This scheme builds off innovations in cell-free synthetic biology and biosensing that enable rapid, low-cost, and PON detection of chemical contaminants and viral pathogens. The platform technology under development could serve several purposes from a quick-screen technology to inform triage and isolation strategies, to a clinical test used on the front lines. There is also the potential for the technology to eventually serve as an at-home test to help inform which subpopulations and sectors of the economy could safely return to productivity towards the end of the pandemic. In addition, the test has the flexibility to be rapidly reprogrammed to detect new emerging pathogens. This work is pursued in close collaboration with a commercial partner, Stemloop, Inc., in order to quickly transition the technology for manufacturing, deployment, and distribution.<br/><br/>This project employs a new CRISPR Isothermal Amplification (CIA) approach to enable a one-pot amplification and detection of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in an assay for the virus. CIA uses programmed Cas 13 systems to recognize SARS-CoV-2 RNA, trigger nucleic acid amplification and create a detectable output simultaneously in the same reaction where amplification occurs. Computational models of each process are developed alongside the experimental systems and used to guide optimizations to achieve attomolar sensitivity. The method is unique in that no DNA primers are required. The amplification and detection processes are designed to take less than one hour and cost less than one dollar per test to manufacture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Understanding the timing and sequence of these policy choices, and those policies? eventual consequences, is critical for assessing how governments can be most effective during pandemics. This project collects data on state and local governments? responses to COVID-19, including policies related to closing schools, canceling travel, banning public gatherings, closing restaurants and bars, delaying rent payments, and rules on medical licenses. This data allows researchers to examine the factors that influence states? policy choices, whether those factors differ from the ways in which states enact policies during normal times, which policies are effective in slowing the spread and morbidity of the virus, and how states roll back policies in a manner that allows economic activity to resume while maintaining preparedness to avoid and mitigated waves of the virus. <br/><br/>This project collects data on state government responses to COVID-19 by scraping government websites daily, focusing on sites dedicated to COVID-19 and those associated with the executive branch, state legislatures, and state departments of public health. It also collects data on the number of diagnosed cases, fatalities, recoveries in the states, and mobility data that tracks geographic movements from mobile phones. The policy recommendations or decisions recorded from state government pages include decisions related to closing schools, canceling travel, banning public gatherings (and their size), closing restaurants and bars, travel quarantines, postponing elections, safe shelter orders, limiting elective medical procedures, as well as when states modify these policies; additional data is collected from official state Twitter accounts. This data allows researchers to examine the factors that influence states? policy choices, whether those factors differ from the ways in which states enact policies during normal times, which policies are effective in slowing the spread and morbidity of the virus, and how states roll back policies in a manner that allows economic activity to resume while maintaining preparedness to avoid and mitigated waves of the virus. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Accountable Institutions and Behavior Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

688	Cameron Browne	University of Louisiana at Lafayette	None	2020-04-15	2021-03-31	RAPID: Epidemiological and Phylogenetic Models for Contact-Based Control of COVID-19	Mathematical and Physical Sciences - The current COVID-19 pandemic shows that effective and responsive public health systems are crucial for curbing emergent outbreaks. Increased case detection, contact tracing, and broad quarantine and social distancing measures, have been vital for containing COVID-19 outbreaks. Mathematical modeling and analysis can provide important insights into the efficacy of these ?contact-based? non-pharmaceutical interventions. However, model parameterization requires detailed case data, which is often challenged by inconsistent, unreported and asymptomatic cases. To overcome these difficulties, the researchers will: develop outbreak models of COVID-19 with quarantine, tracing and social distancing and derive new results on final epidemic size and reproduction number under quarantine measures to flatten and shrink the epidemic curve. The researchers will also integrate case and phylogenetic data for an innovative framework that reveals region-specific control and predicts how to best implement contact-based measures for efficiently containing the outbreaks. Results will be communicated with policymakers, along with scientific and public audiences, in order to have a real-time impact on the coronavirus pandemic.<br/><br/>This project will consider compartmental outbreak models of COVID-19 with responsive quarantine, tracing and social distancing measures. The novel formulation allows for derivation of outbreak size, dependent on contact tracing and broad quarantine intervention parameters. Reproduction number estimates and model fitting of case, tracing and quarantine data will quantify region-specific control characteristics. Sensitivity of epidemic size to combinations of contact tracing and social distancing measures will be assessed to understand viable strategies for flattening and shrinking epidemic curves. Long term scenarios of loosening and tightening of quarantine interventions for sustainable control will be investigated through analysis and simulation of the models. In addition, through interdisciplinary collaboration, the researchers will incorporate multi-region stochastic versions of the epidemiological models with phylodynamic computations of genomic data to improve model projections in the presence of possible unknown chains of transmission and area-specific responsive interventions. A ?forward simulation-backward coalescent? approach will track migration events and produce phylogenetic tree signatures for matching model simulations to phylogenetic data. The overall combined phylodynamic and epidemic model analysis will quantify heterogeneous disease spread and contact-based control efficacy to inform public health authorities.<br/><br/><br/>This award is being funded by the CARES Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Gregory Forest	University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	RAPID: A Lung Mucus Strategy for COVID-19 Viral Protection	Mathematical and Physical Sciences - Vulnerability to COVID-19 arises from multiple risk factors, but two are particularly prominent: lack of antibodies (Ab) to the novel coronavirus; and structural properties of lung mucus. This project addresses both risk factors through focused experiments and data from two labs in an active feedback loop with mathematical modeling, simulations, and theory. The mathematical effort will provide a platform, starting from a baseline model and simulation of exposure to inhaled COVID-19 without Ab protection. The baseline model will distinguish clearance of the inhaled viral load versus onset and propagation of respiratory infection. Two experimental interventions will be simulated on top of the baseline model at progressive stages of infection: inhaled doses of COVID-19-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and of structure-targeted mucolytics. Both labs will leverage mathematical predictions to accelerate and optimize their strategies to mitigate COVID-19 disease. Likewise, experimental results and data will be leveraged to validate models and learn hidden factors critical to the predictive accuracy of the models. The potential broader impact of this project is to predict optimal, mAb-based and mucolytic-based treatments for specific sub-populations at various stages of COVID-19 lung infection.<br/><br/>The mathematical modeling platform will explore the delicate interplay among: inhaled loads of COVID-19, their diffusion within, and potentially through, the mucus-coated respiratory tract; infectivity onset as COVID-19 reaches and invades epithelial cells, produces daughters that invade new cells and propagate the infection; how long after exposure to COVID-19 either natural antibodies or engineered mAb are introduced into the mucus layer; and, the rate of clearance of the mucus layer from the lung. The latter clearance rate is known to depend, often dramatically, on structural properties of mucus in vulnerable sub-populations to COVID-19. The experimental team will test outcomes of existing mAb on non-infectious COVID-19 nanoparticles. A multi-species stochastic model will simulate diffusion and propagation of COVID-19, interrupted by mAb-crosslinks between COVID-19 and mucins. Some reaction-diffusion parameters are measured while others will be learned from experimental data using hidden Markov methods. A polymer-physics-based molecular dynamics model of mucus will simulate structure properties of mucus based on the chemical structure and concentrations of mucin polymers known for specific sub-populations. With this modeling platform, the goals are to: optimize mAb design; characterize efficiency of given mAb affinities to COVID-19 and mucus; and quantify the inhaled mAb dose required to arrest COVID-19 infection at various stages of progression, specific to mucus structure properties.<br/><br/>This grant is being awarded using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

690	Matthew Junge	Bard College	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Collaborative Research: Quarantined Networks and the Spread of COVID-19	Mathematical and Physical Sciences - As the global community weighs the necessary extent of quarantine and social distancing to fight the spread of COVID-19, the critical question is how disease transmission is mitigated by these measures. Recent predictions suggest that without serious interventions, a large portion of the world population will become infected, resulting in millions of deaths. To mitigate this worst-case scenario, key policy decisions are being guided by mathematical models. However, several prominent models make unrealistic assumptions about human contacts i.e., that an individual is equally likely to infect a close family member as a complete stranger on the other side of the country. Such assumptions are useful for calculations, but fail to take into account the full geographic complexity of the outbreak. Furthermore, many models do not consider the consequences of the quarantine of healthy individuals. This project will use rigorous analysis and simulation to address these shortcomings by describing a more realistic structure of quarantined networks and how disease spreads in them. The proposed research will use real-world data about contact networks to make predictions and recommendations for controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, improving our understanding of how best to contain the current as well as future pandemics. The project will involve the training of undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This research will describe the effect of quarantine on connectivity and disease transmission on more realistic networks than have previously been considered. Of particular importance will be locating critical thresholds which, when exceeded, allow large epidemics to occur. There is recent study of these thresholds, but for networks that model digital infrastructure and social networks. The first objective of the research will be to determine the effect of biased site percolation on graph structure, especially how different percolation rules influence the size of the largest component of a given graph. The second part will then focus on how the critical threshold and size of the epidemic for an SIR model change after percolation. This will be explored rigorously on graphs generated from the configuration model as well as random spatial networks such as Gilbert graphs. Additionally, these questions will be investigated on real world face-to-face networks using data specific to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Answering them will help test robustness of previous models, while also exploring the effectiveness of stronger preemptive distancing.<br/><br/>This grant is being awarded using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Health organizations, government, and local communities have introduced various measures to reduce the impact of the pandemic. In this global context, this project examines and compares people?s compliance with these measures over time, and across diverse cultural and governance contexts. Specifically, it focuses on how different value and belief systems influence (non-)compliance with containment measures as the pandemic unfolds. In doing so, the research enhances basic understanding of science/policy communications and their impact on public attitudes and behaviors. Ultimately, the project helps identify best science communication practices to inform and educate people about COVID-19 and similar crises. <br/><br/>Policies and scientific recommendations aimed to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus have generated critical discussions about the prioritization of collective versus individual values. Tradeoffs often focus on public security and health versus individual autonomy and civil liberties. As a result, large-scale societal crises have the potential to shift value prioritization both during and beyond the crisis. By integrating theories from social and cross-cultural psychology, this research explores the role of different value systems, including basic human values, social values, and cultural values, in public responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. A collaborative research network will collect primary data from representative adult samples at three time points during the pandemic. Changes are tracked in public endorsement of different values over the course of three months. Analyses focus on how these changes predict attitudinal and behavioral responses to policies and scientific recommendations. The project also examines the roles of factors such as the severity of the pandemic, socio-economic condition, and existing value systems in these changes. The research will advance scientific understanding of basic human values, how people respond to science communications, and how best to design such communications to achieve important societal goals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Currently, there are over two million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with nearly 700,000 cases in the United States. Limited testing capacity and asymptomatic infections have resulted in significant unknowns in the actual number of infections by SARS-CoV2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19). Therefore, alternative methods of tracking the SARS-CoV2 are urgently needed. The goal of this RAPID project monitor public health by surveilling SARS-CoV2 presence in wastewater in four cities in CA, NC, Washington DC, and TX. Samples will be gathered before, during, and after infection peaks in these four cities, creating a data collection essential to understanding the current pandemic. Coronavirus levels will be determined using methods that target specific parts of the virus. The wastewater data will be compared to data from the healthcare system to determine if testing wastewater can help predict COVID-19 presence in a community. Knowledge gained from this study will advance the understanding of how wastewater testing can be used to guide healthcare resources to individual communities, reducing long-term economic disruption of the larger community during future outbreaks.<br/><br/>Limited diagnostic testing and asymptomatic infections result in large uncertainty in the actual extent of SARS-CoV2 infections. Analysis of municipal wastewater is equivalent to analyzing a pooled sample from all community members for a community-scale measure of infection dynamics. A coordinated effort across four major geographically diverse metropolitan areas, Orange County, Raleigh, Washington, and DC, Houston will address knowledge gaps in the use of wastewater surveillance as a public health monitoring tool. Raw wastewater and primary solids will be collected from four municipal wastewater treatment plants throughout the infection period to quantify SARS-CoV2, seasonal influenza, and an enteric virus in the samples. Using identical experimental protocols and incorporating other viruses into this analysis will validate and expand the understanding of wastewater surveillance as a public health monitoring tool for various human viruses in addition to SARS-CoV2. The team has public health and wastewater treatment expertise to examine how wastewater data relates to clinical data. The results from this study will help to characterize the full potential of wastewater surveillance as a public health monitoring tool and help prepare public health officials for future outbreaks.

To encourage social distancing, many states have closed schools and nonessential businesses and instituted ?Stay-at-Home? orders that limit trips to necessary activities such as grocery shopping and medical care. While Stay-at-Home orders are typically considered mandatory, most states rely on voluntary compliance rather than penalize infractions through citations or arrests. A persistent concern throughout the crisis has been the extent to which individuals are choosing to practice social distancing effectively in order to slow the growth of the pandemic. Yet, to date, virtually no systematic information has emerged on differences in social distancing across social groups by income, race/ethnicity, and residential neighborhood and, critically, why these differences exist. This project will address this gap by collecting detailed data on social distancing practices during the COVID-19 pandemic ? including the timing and location of non-home trips over the course of a week ? from a sample of youth and their caregivers in the Columbus, OH area. The study will build on an ongoing project focused on differences in patterns of everyday activity under normal (non-pandemic) conditions). Enhanced effectiveness of social distancing holds the potential to save millions of lives, reduce the burden to inevitably taxed health care systems during pandemics, and mitigate potential longer-term damage to the US and global economies due to ineffective pandemic containment. Findings from the project will provide crucial guidance to policy-makers who must target interventions to most effectively contain viral outbreaks and address the needs of the most vulnerable populations during pandemics. Findings will also provide important information for epidemiologists who must model disease spread based on realistic assumptions regarding social distancing practices across the population. Finally, clinicians will also benefit from more precise information on infection risk profiles at the individual level. <br/><br/>COVID-19 has prompted requirements for social-distancing, and yet we know little about who complies and who does not. This project will re-contact 246 households (N=309 youth) who participated in an ongoing NIH-funded study of everyday spatial exposures that was in the field in the period prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (the Adolescent Health and Development in Context study). Objective 1 of the study will investigate the association between income, race/ethnicity, and residential neighborhood economic disadvantage and typical (pre-pandemic) exposure to higher infection risk locations as captured by the density of social interaction at those places. These data will shed light on infection risk during the early stages of the pandemic before social distancing behaviors were widely adopted. The study will leverage unique data from the baseline study on the geographic location and associated characteristics of everyday places visited based on a novel survey-based method for the collection of geographically-referenced activity data. Objective 2 of the study will re-administer this location data collection approach during the peak period of the pandemic to measure income, race/ethnicity and neighborhood variation in the extent of social distancing behaviors for both caregivers and youth. Objective 3 will address the consequences of pandemic exposure and social distancing behaviors for economic hardship, mental health, family conflict, and youth behavioral problems. The project will generate the first geographically referenced data on the mobility of youth and their caregivers during pandemics in combination with extensive, high quality social survey data. Findings will inform sociological theories regarding the social and geographic determinants of compliance behavior, which complement psychological investigations more attuned to personality and individual determinants of the same.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

New types of surface treatments that exhibit antipathogenic ?contact-kill? capabilities are urgently sought to protect public health and welfare. To this end, cuprous oxide is reported as a highly effective antimicrobial compound; while the origin of its antimicrobial property remains unknown, it is hypothesized to be a consequence of atomic-level copper vacancies in its crystal lattice that provide highly charged atomic environments. These locally energetic regions in the lattice are thought to disrupt and destroy cell membranes and/or the protein shell of viruses. Interdisciplinary research quantifies connections between the cuprous oxide lattice condition and its biocidal activity to permit rational engineering of this abundant, inexpensive and easily handled material for incorporation into coatings for public spaces.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: Correlations between the cuprous oxide lattice defect condition and its antipathogenic response to representative organisms are quantified through structural and electronic probes, including magnetometry and photoabsorption. Lattice-defective cuprous oxide, synthesized by high-energy mechanical processing, is incorporated into coatings and subjected to biological assays to quantify any reduction in viable bacteria and viruses after prolonged exposure. Students and junior researchers involved in this project work at the typically unfrequented intersection of inorganic materials science and biology. These tests, which are designed to simulate actual conditions where a pathogen might survive on a given surface, provide enabling knowledge to engineer cuprous oxide, and perhaps other oxide materials, for antipathogenic purposes to address the current COVID-19 pandemic and to proactively confront future health challenges.<br/><br/>This award is being funded by the CARES Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Seasonal return of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) will be even more devastating. One of the primary ways that SARS-CoV-2 appears to spread is through people touching surfaces with virus-laden droplets. Virus survivability on surfaces varies greatly by droplet size and composition, surface material and texture, and the ambient temperature and relative humidity. These factors impact the concentration of salt and other solutes in the process of droplets drying on surfaces, which strongly influences the survival of viruses in the droplets. This project will address survivability of viruses inside droplets and its relationship to droplet size, type of surface and ambient conditions representing seasonal variations. The team will especially seek to understand conditions under which virus survival in surface-adherent droplets is diminished. This information is crucial for public health officials, virologists, and other experts working on disinfection efforts to control and mitigate current and future COVID-19 outbreaks.<br/><br/>This project will bring together an interdisciplinary team of engineers, virologists, and infectious disease experts to understand the mechanisms that determine virus survival/annihilation on different surfaces under varying seasonal conditions. The research plan combines computer simulations and experiments to reveal what happens inside droplets under conditions specific to COVID-19 scenarios. More specifically, this project will study the thermal and mass transport processes that occur in droplets drying on various surfaces. Project results will include quantitative information on the solute (salt, protein) concentration-time pathways in the interior of virus-carrying droplets drying on surfaces. These pathways will be quantified as functions of droplet size, composition, ambient temperature and relative humidity, and surface characteristics. Novel laser and chemical treatments of surfaces will be employed to modify hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity over a wide range to examine the effect of such modifications on droplet drying processes. This project will therefore reveal what types of seasonal conditions and surface modifications will contribute to diminished survival of viruses within droplets. The project team will transition project results to experts who study methods to deactivate viruses. Arming them with precise knowledge on the thermochemical conditions faced by the pathogens within drying droplets will enable them to focus attention on effective disinfection techniques.<br/><br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Thermal Transport Processes program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

697	John Yin	University of Wisconsin-Madison	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Ecological Dynamics of Human Coronavirus	Biological Sciences - With the zoonotic spillover of coronavirus into humans and the rapid emergence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), humanity faces its first global pandemic in more than a century. Current molecular, cellular and animal studies of the infectious agent, SARS-CoV-2, use purified virus stocks that ignore a more likely scenario which is that the natural infection spreads as a mixture of active and defective virus strains. This project is developing mathematical models and wet-lab experiments on human coronaviruses that highlight how ecological interactions between such strains and their host cells critically impact the dynamics of virus growth, spread and ultimately their ability to cause disease. The developed models account for the presence of defective virus strains. The broader impact of the results of this project would guide clinical and front-line researchers with direct access to patients, in exploring broader and deeper measures of the infection dynamics and in applying novel therapies. The project has potential to significantly impact the development of strategies that mitigate the pandemic. <br/><br/>This project develops mathematical models and performs wet-lab experiments on human coronaviruses. The outcome will highlight how ecological interactions between strains and their host cells could critically impact the dynamics of virus growth, spread and ultimately their ability to cause disease. The project goals are to: (i) extract essential mechanisms and parameters of coronavirus intracellular growth from the literature, (ii) build mathematical models that account for the kinetics of viral entry, gene expression, genome replication and particle assembly in the absence and presence of defective interfering (DI) particles, and (iii) implement wet-lab experiments to demonstrate the emergence of DI particles from coronavirus cultures, activation immune cytokine signaling, and validate the intracellular kinetic models.

However, like many viruses that cause serious morbidity and mortality, coronaviruses can mutate and develop drug resistance. Effective treatment may require the availability of multiple effective drugs. Thousands of drug candidates are available, but a current bottleneck is drug testing, which entails virus growth in cell cultures, a labor intensive, low sensitivity, and time-consuming process that can take up to a week to perform. ThIs EAGER project exploits microscopic fluid flows in cell and virus cultures to enhance sensitivity and speed, potentially reducing test times to one day. The project aims to identify best conditions for testing of drugs against the COVID-19 virus, which will expand opportunities to effectively treat infected patients.<br/><br/>The gold standard for testing anti-viral drugs is the plaque assay, which gives direct measures of drug effect on the production and spread of infectious virus particles in the cell culture. However, the plaque assay is labor-intensive, limited in sensitivity for drug testing, and it can take a week to perform. As an alternative, a team with expertise in virology and fluid dynamics will advance a faster, more sensitive assay. The approach exploits flow-enhanced infection spread and automated quantitative imaging, which they will optimize for coronavirus drug testing. The technology exploits microscale flows that sweep across infected cells, enhancing the spread of infection; in cell-culture wells, radial flows spontaneously arise from enhanced evaporative cooling at the fluid surface near the center of the each well, driving natural convection. The project may enable a 10-to100-fold higher sensitivity in one-tenth the time for testing drug candidates against COVID-19. Such accelerated testing could help efficiently identify drugs that significantly reduce morbidity and mortality from the ongoing pandemic and its possible re-emergence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

699	Danmeng Shuai	George Washington University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Collaborative Research: Electrospun Nanofibrous Air Filters for Coronavirus Control	Engineering - A collaborative team consisting of researchers from The George Washington University and the University of California, Riverside is developing electrospun nanofibrous air filters for controlling the transmission of coronavirus, including SARS-CoV-2. The pandemic of COVID-19 has raised a significant public health concern in 2020. The spread of COVID-19 is difficult to control, because SARS-CoV-2 is environmentally persistent and it can potentially be suspended in aerosols for long-range, airborne transmission and infection. Air filtration is crucial to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission, however most air filters used in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings are not effective for retaining viruses. As personal protective equipment for healthcare personnel or even the general public, respirators and masks that can effectively capture the virus are also urgently needed for this pandemic. Electrospinning has emerged as a novel technology to synthesize non-woven nanofibrous mats, and it is both industrially viable for large-scale manufacturing and deployable onsite for small-scale applications by a portable device. The fabricated nanofibrous mats are ideal for air filtration, because they have a reduced pore size to efficiently capture the virus, a large porosity to reduce air pressure drop in filtration, well-controlled properties, and mechanical robustness and flexibility. This RAPID research project will rationally design and fabricate novel nanomaterial-based air filters for coronavirus control, understand the interplay between viral pathogens and nanomaterials in complex environmental matrices, and initiate a fast response for protecting the public health with engineering tools. The project will provide training to students in science and engineering areas and offer them hands-on research experience, and introduce students from diverse backgrounds and educational levels, particularly those from underrepresented groups, to cutting-edge research in STEM. In addition, the project will disseminate the acquired knowledge through education modules, scientific journals and conferences, and science fairs, which will help increase the scientific literacy of the general public.<br/><br/>The research team aims to rationally design and fabricate electrospun nanofibrous air filters that are effective, low-cost, scalable, and easy for implementation for coronavirus control, including SARS-CoV-2, and to understand the mechanism of coronavirus removal in air filtration. The researchers will first develop electrospun nanofibrous air filters with diverse morphologies, retained charges, and selective binding sites to enhance the capture of bioaerosols containing coronavirus. Coronavirus removal efficiency under different environmental conditions will next be evaluated to understand the performance and robustness of the air filters. Key virus-nanomaterial interactions will be identified with the aid of both simulation and experimental tools, which can guide future air filter design and optimization. For this RAPID project, the researchers will also test the performance of air filters for removing SARS-CoV-2 in a healthcare facility that houses COVID-19 patients. The proposed research will contribute significantly to nanotechnology, microbiology, and environmental engineering, and it can be potentially transformative in the field of materials at large in terms of multiscale, rational, functional design. It will not only provide a rapid response to COVID-19 outbreaks and public health protection, but also be translated into controlling other virulent pathogens.

Beyond the tragic health toll of this outbreak, there has been increased targeting of minority groups of U.S. residents. The Coronavirus outbreak has refueled stereotypes (e.g., eating ?strange? foods, having unsanitary lifestyles, being disease-ridden) that are veiled under health-related fears. Racial discrimination significantly decreases well-being and increases psychological distress as well as mental and physical health. Most studies on the effects of racism on identity, resilience, and parental socialization, have focused on discrimination among adolescents and emerging adults. This innovative interdisciplinary study will significantly advance our understanding of risk and resilience in response to acute social stress among families with children in three different age groups, early childhood (4-7 years), middle childhood (8-11 years) and early-to-mid adolescence (12-15 years). Findings will identify key developmental and social processes that influence how identities of racial minority parents and their children are formed. The influence of an acute but prolonged threat to their social identities resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak may provide insight into the general nature of this process as well. <br/><br/>This interdisciplinary team comprising a cultural developmental scientist, a school psychologist, and a computer scientist will study multiple forms of COVID-19 racial discrimination and the subsequent impact on the identity development and adjustment of minority parents and children. The study will focus on how parents socialize their children about issues of race and identity in reaction to this event at the early part of 2020 and again 6-9 months later. Protective factors for adjustment in parents and children will also be identified. In addition, large scale texts of outbreak-related social media (Twitter) posts will be analyzed to account for how public opinion, anxiety, and discriminatory attitudes evolve with the peaking and fading of this epidemic and provide objective indicators of the larger public social discourse climate across the year. Infectious diseases will continue to emerge and re-emerge globally, and their negative impact on psychological and social health is understudied but highly significant, leading to both significant social and economic consequences. Knowledge from this research may help inform the types of services and education that can promote well-being in targeted marginalized groups and the larger public during future similar events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Since first diagnosed in the United States in February 2020, coronavirus has spread rapidly across the country. The objective of this RAPID project is to collect a wide range of public opinion data from a representative sample of Americans to track the public reaction to coronavirus. Information on contemporary health scares typically lead individuals to favor health policy measures, such as vaccines and quarantines, and high levels of government trust to support coordinated responses to epidemics. <br/><br/>This project will study factors that shape the public reactions to coronavirus in the context of this rapidly unfolding public health emergency. Data will be collected in two waves from a large random sample of Americans using YouGov. The PIs will measure public understanding of coronavirus as well as public support for various policy responses to contain or manage the severity of the crisis. The study's findings will help to provide guidance on how public health authorities can best communicate with Americans, and can assist in targeting public health responses to those communities that may be most vulnerable to the virus but not aware of the danger that it presents.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

703	Giulia Pedrielli	Arizona State University	None	2020-04-15	2021-03-31	Collaborative Research: RAPID: RTEM: Rapid Testing as Multi-fidelity Data Collection for Epidemic Modeling	Biological Sciences - The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic is generating significant social, economic, and health impacts and has highlighted the importance of real-time analysis of the spatio-temporal dynamics of emerging infectious diseases. COVID-19, which emerged out of the city of Wuhan in China in December 2019 is now spreading in multiple countries. It is particularly concerning that the case fatality rate appears to be higher for the novel coronavirus than for seasonal influenza, and especially so for older populations and those with prior health conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Any plan for stopping the epidemic must be based on a quantitative understanding of the proportion of the at-risk population that needs to be protected by effective control measures in order for transmission to decline sufficiently and quickly enough for the epidemic to end. Different data collection and testing modalities and strategies available to help calibrate transmission models and predict the spread/severity of a disease, have variable costs, response times, and accuracies. In this Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project, the team will examine the problem of establishing optimal practices for rapid testing for the novel coronavirus. The result will be the Rapid Testing for Epidemic Modeling (RTEM), which will translate into science-based predictions of the COVID-19 epidemic's characteristics, including the duration and overall size, and help the global efforts to combat the disease. The RTEM will fill an important gap in data-driven decision making during the COVID-19 epidemic and, thus, will enable services with significant national economic and health impact. The educational impact of the project will be on mentoring of post-doctoral and PhD researchers and on curricula by incorporating research challenges and outcomes into existing undergraduate and graduate classes. <br/><br/>Computational models for the spatio-temporal dynamics of emerging infectious diseases and data- and model-driven computer simulations for disease spreading are increasingly critical in predicting geo-temporal evolution of epidemics as well as designing, activating, and adapting practices for controlling epidemics. In this project, the researchers tackle a Rapid Testing for Epidemic Modeling (RTEM) problem: Given a partially known target disease model and a set of testing modalities (from surveys to surveillance testing at known disease hotspots), with varying costs, accuracies, and observational delays, what is the best rapid testing strategy that would help recover the underlying disease model? Several scientific questions arise: What is the value of testing? Should only sick people be tested for virus detection? What level of resources should be devoted to the development of highly accurate tests (low false positives, low false negatives)? Is it better to use only one type of test aiming at the best cost/effectiveness trade off, or a non-homogeneous testing policy? Naturally these questions need to be investigated at the interface of epidemiology, computer science, machine learning, mathematical modeling and statistics. As part of the work, the team will develop a model of transmission dynamics and control, tailored to COVID-19 in a way that accommodates diagnostic testing with varying fidelities and delays underlying a rapid testing regimen. The investigators will further integrate the resulting RTEM-SEIR model with EpiDMS and DataStorm for executing continuous coupled simulations.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded through the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program (Division of Environmental Biology) and the Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing innovation program (Engineering).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

704	Brian Lickel	UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST	None	2020-04-01	2021-03-31	RAPID: A Multi-Level Analysis of Social and Behavioral Responses to COVID-19	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - The COVID-19 outbreak represents a rapidly unfolding and important challenge to the United States and to the world at large with the potential for significant social and economic impact. Non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented as part of a broader effort to slow the spread of the disease. U.S. citizens were instructed to increase hygiene efforts such as hand-washing and to increase social distancing by limiting contact with other people, especially in large crowds. In some states, school and business closures, as well as other forms of mandated restrictions, also began impacting people and families. Understanding the public?s response to this ongoing outbreak is vital, and social psychological and decision-science perspectives may uniquely contribute to the effectiveness of governmental and non-governmental efforts to respond effectively to further crises. This project examines predictors of behavior during the outbreak (for example, engaging in social distancing), emotional and coping responses (for example, seeking social support), and changes in social attitudes (for example, trust in public policies). The research tests the idea that both personal welfare and collective/national welfare can facilitate appropriate health behaviors. By following people over time during 2020, the study provides periodic snapshots of public responses to the outbreak as well as testing important scientific questions that will inform future public health and disaster-response interventions.<br/><br/>This RAPID project is centered on a four-wave longitudinal survey of a representative sample of 3,000 U.S. residents. Study participants are first contacted in March, 2020, and then again at three later time-points roughly every 12 weeks. The research is designed to provide an index of the evolving public response to the outbreak throughout the year. Threats are conceptualized as either threats to the self or threats to the national welfare. Similarly, reactions to those threats are framed as requiring personal responsibility or requiring a national response. Because the study assesses the same participants over time, the research addresses how changes in people?s circumstances predict changes in psychological and behavioral responses. One question is whether changes in concerns regarding the broader social impact predict adherence to public health advice and mandates differently than concerns about personal health impacts. The study also identifies participants? geographic location; over time, survey responses will be integrated with publicly available data to examine how local factors influence psychological responses. This will help address whether people in states and communities with greater investment in community resilience (e.g., public health funding) show better coping responses to the outbreak than in states and communities with lower investments in community resilience. The study design incorporates communication interventions at waves 2 and 3 to test the role of social norm information and shared (versus individual) responsibility on people?s willingness to follow public health guidelines and mandates. Using these longitudinal, geographic, and experimental methods, the research will test hypotheses on four broad topics: personal and social responsibility, norms and social influence, coping and emotion regulation, and impacts of the outbreak on social cohesion and conflict. The new knowledge will inform future public health and policy interventions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

705	Grzegorz Rempala	Ohio State University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Modeling Outbreak of COVID-19 Using Dynamic Survival Analysis	Mathematical and Physical Sciences - The outbreak of COVID-19 has created a tremendous need for predicting both the dynamics and the size of regional COVID-19 outbreaks. Equally important is the need to determine the potential effects of early interventions such as school closures and mandatory or self-imposed quarantines. To answer these questions, this project will develop a general mathematical framework for analyzing the ongoing outbreak trends using data solely from partially observed new daily infection counts (also known as the epidemic curve). The PI?s new framework will not assume any specific infectious or recovery periods (which are often unknown) or observable prevalence of the disease. The tools developed as part of this project will both help predict the rate of growth of new infections and estimate the effect of social distancing and other preventative measures on flattening the epidemic curve. The PI will use a new dynamical survival analysis approach to predict the trajectory of the COVID-19 epidemic for a mid-western region of the United States. Data from elsewhere in the world, like the city of Wuhan in China, will be used to calibrate the predictions. The project will also provide a practical interdisciplinary training for a PhD student and a post-doctoral fellow.<br/><br/>The modeling and predictive framework to be developed is fundamentally different from the traditional approach based on the incidence or prevalence counts in a compartmental SIR model. Specifically, the PI will apply the dynamical survival analysis (DSA) approach that considers aggregated mean field equations for the underlying large stochastic network and regards them as the approximate survival law of the infection times. The PI will use these DSA-based equations to model both the epidemic and recovery curves and compare them with the ones observed during the COVID-19 outbreak. The statistical analysis of epidemic data performed with the help of the new framework will allow the quick elucidation of the dynamics of an epidemic (for example, the basic reproduction number, R0) and the potential impact of interventions (such as quarantine or social distancing). The new framework will help provide a better understanding of how preventive behaviors affect COVID-19 dynamics via changes in the network structure and changes in disease transmission across edges in the network. This project will develop a user-friendly software package for computer simulations under different parameter and intervention scenarios (for example, vaccination schemes) that will lead to a better understanding of how to control COVID-19 transmission.<br/><br/>This grant is being awarded using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

This RAPID program instead uses fast and inexpensive optical techniques to detect<br/>the physical properties of viral pathogens. The breakthrough that enables this new approach to medical diagnostics is a technique called holographic particle characterization (HPC). HPC creates laser holograms of specially prepared test beads and uses those holograms to monitor small changes in the beads? properties that occur when molecules or virus particles bind to their surfaces. Originally developed for fundamental research in soft condensed matter physics, HPC already has been demonstrated to provide fast and sensitive immunoassays in model systems. These measurements are fast, inexpensive and can be performed automatically with minimal human intervention. The next step is to create libraries of test beads for different target diseases and to demonstrate that HPC can diagnose those diseases - first in the research laboratory, and then in a clinical setting. The anticipated product of this work is a new platform for diagnosing viral infections that can meet the need for fast, accurate and cost-effective testing under the strains imposed by public health crises.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>There is an urgent need for new technologies to detect viral pathogens. Holographic binding assays can detect the presence of virus particles and antibodies in fluid media through their influence on the optical properties of functionalized probe beads. The micrometer-scale beads that will be developed for this program will incorporate chemical groups on their surfaces to selectively bind specific targets, such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19 or the antibodies that are produced in response to infection. Bound targets increase the apparent size of a bead and alter its light-scattering properties. Both of these effects can be resolved directly by holographic particle characterization, a comparatively new platform technology that has the demonstrated ability to measure the diameter and refractive index of micrometer-scale colloidal spheres with part-per-thousand precision. A statistical sample consisting of thousands of single-bead measurements can be completed in a matter of minutes using commercial instrumentation for holographic particle characterization. Specialized reagents are not required. Multiplexed assays for multiple targets can be performed with libraries of functionalized beads that are distinguished by their base diameters and refractive indexes. Each such assay can therefore simultaneously diagnose a viral infection both by the presence of virions, and also by the presence of antibodies. This RAPID program will deliver scalable syntheses of probe beads for diagnosing viral infection and automated protocols for performing holographic binding assays, enabling high-throughput medical diagnostics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

707	Susan Daniel	Cornell University	None	2020-04-01	2021-03-31	RAPID: Revealing the intermolecular interactions between the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 fusion peptide and the host cell membrane that underlie its flexibility in host tropism	Biological Sciences - Coronavirus is a membrane-enveloped package decorated with ?spikes? that protrude from its surface. These spikes interact with the host cell to initiate infection of that cell. The ability of coronavirus to spread to other cells depends on how well the spike interacts with its target host membrane. The part of the spike that controls this interaction is called the ?fusion peptide? and its job is to insert into the host membrane to initiate the delivery its genetic cargo into the cell. However, the specifics of how the fusion peptide interacts with the membrane is still not known. In this project, various interactions between the fusion peptide with membrane surfaces that mimic different kinds of host cells will be studied. This information will provide insight into the characteristics of both the fusion peptide and the host cell that promotes their interaction, and ultimately, infection and viral transmission to new hosts. With a better understanding of the science behind this critical interaction for virus adaptation to new hosts, we will be better informed about how this virus spreads and ultimately equipped to develop strategies to stop it. This fundamental information has the potential to enable fresh approaches to the design of antiviral drugs that target the fusion peptide. Given that the fusion peptide is highly conserved across the coronavirus family, these studies will be directly applicable to all coronaviruses, including the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.<br/><br/>A key determinant of the ability of coronavirus to spread is how it interacts with its target host membrane. For coronavirus, entry into a host cell is mediated by a single glycoprotein protruding from its membrane envelope, called spike (S). Within S, the region that directly interacts with the membrane is called the fusion peptide, FP. It is the physico-chemical interactions of the FP with the host membrane that anchors it, thus enabling the necessary deformations of the membrane that lead to delivery of the viral genome into the cell. Thus, understanding FP interactions at the most fundamental level will facilitate the development of strategies to limit those interactions to stop the spread of infections. This information is expected to be helpful in predicting the characteristics of emerging strains that could post a threat to humans in the future. The objective of this project is to measure and identify the specific intermolecular interactions responsible for insertion of FP into membranes. Specifically, this project will: 1) elucidate the factors that control hydrophobic interactions of FP using single molecule force measurements with atomic force microscopy and models of biological membranes, and 2) characterize the structure-function relationship of the FP using circular dichroism and isothermal calorimetry to correlate specific interactions with amino acid sequence and host surface properties. The intellectual merit of this project is discovering how changes in host membrane chemistry or amino acid sequence of the FP modulates the hydrophobic interaction and ultimately influences activity critical to the spread of infection. The broader impact of this project is providing information that will enable fresh approaches to the design of antiviral drugs, as well as to identify basic design rules that inform how the FP promotes the interaction with membranes of specific chemistry to predict host susceptibility to infection. Given that the FP is highly conserved across the CoV family, these studies will be directly applicable to all CoVs, including those yet to emerge.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

708	Andrew Parker	Rand Corporation	None	2020-04-01	2021-03-31	RAPID: Evolution of Public Risk Perception and Mental Models Regarding COVID-19	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - In crises such as the emergence of COVID-19, the public is a critical response partner. Novel threats are concerning to the public, but often poorly understood, with misunderstanding leading to inappropriate reactions. Clarifying when and why misperceptions occur is important because resulting behavior can contribute to disease spread, supply shortages, and unnecessary health-care system burden. Central are individual mental models, intuitive theories made up of related beliefs or perceptions individuals have about a risk, which may or may not align with scientific consensus. Mental models form a foundation for how people conceive risk, structure decisions, and their risk-related behaviors. This project follows individuals? risk perceptions, mental models, and risk behaviors over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, capitalizing on a time-sensitive opportunity to push forward the science on public risk responses to crises, within a concrete public health context. <br/><br/>The primary goal is to longitudinally track risk perceptions, mental models, and risk-related behaviors within individuals over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary goals are to develop new methodological approaches to process and analyze large-sample mental models data and engage experts on our approach and needs for larger infrastructure. The project leverages existing data and planned survey data collection, building out a longitudinal assessment to be able to capture changes in risk perceptions, mental models, and behaviors. The surveys use freelisting, a simple free-association technique from anthropology, to gather a large-sample picture of people?s risk mental models. The research team employs automated lexical analysis tools to process the data and network analytic techniques to map out the mental models. The team uses regression analysis to examine relationships among mental models, risk perceptions, behavior, and their change over time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

709	Sergei Pond	Temple University	None	2020-04-01	2021-03-31	Rapid: Collaborative Research: Agile and effective responses to emerging pathogen threats through open data and open analytics	Biological Sciences - The same types of questions arise during every emergent viral outbreak regarding its origin, its evolution, the manner of spread, and how to detect and mitigate it. Many, if not all, of these questions depend on rapid and reliable genomic analysis of diverse viral sample sequences by multiple laboratories. Early viral investigation is often impaired lack of reproducibility, rigor, and data/analytic sharing; the current investigation of COVID-19 is no different. Essential questions such as the extent of intra-host genomic variability (indicative of adaptation or multiple infection), viral evolution (selection, recombination), transmission (phylogentic and phylogeographic) cannot be answered reliably if researchers cannot trust/replicate the source data and analytical approaches. The goal of this award is to develop, deploy, and continuously update viral genomic analysis workflows to enable the analysis and monitoring of viral evolution and dynamics for SARS-CoV-2, and to use the lessons learned to prepare capacity for future outbreaks.<br/> <br/>Bioinformatics workflows for critical tasks in investigating COVID-19 and future viral outbreaks will be developed and COVID-19 deep sequencing data will be analyzed and shared openly via Galaxy and Datamonkey to facilitate and accelerate evolutionary discovery and enable the study of and response to inevitable future infectious disease outbreaks. In an age of digital connectivity, open and accessible shared data and analysis platforms have the potential to transform the way biomedical research is done, opening the way to ?global research markets?, where competition arises from deriving understanding rather than access to samples and data. By enabling any researcher with an Internet connection to perform the same analyses as are done by top-flight research groups in resource-rich countries, this award will deliver critical components to resource limited settings, which are often those that are first and disproportionately affected by viral outbreaks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

710	Alin Coman	Princeton University	None	2020-04-01	2021-03-31	RAPID: Community-wide acquisition of medical knowledge about COVID-19 under conditions of risk and uncertainty	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - The response to the COVID-19 pandemic may depend critically on how communities of individuals acquire and propagate medical information. This is especially true given the many and frequent updates of medical information transmission, treatment and containment strategies. Although the diffusion of knowledge has been studied previously, very few models incorporate psychologically grounded assumptions about knowledge search, acquisition, and propagation. Specifically, they do not fully consider (1) that information propagation is influenced by the communicative context, (2) that it is critically affected in high-anxiety, high-uncertainty environments, and (3) that results obtained in dyadic level paradigms cannot simply be extrapolated to large social networks. The integration of these advances will address three key questions: First, how does the high perceived risk of infection influence the lay public?s acquisition and propagation of medical information in social networks? Second, how do emotion, social distancing practices, and media consumption impact medical knowledge acquisition and propagation? And third, what socio-cognitive strategies could one employ to increase the spread of accurate information and to diminish the diffusion of misinformation in social networks? Findings from this study could inform the development of infrastructure and practices to better prepare the population for medical crises. <br/><br/>The COVID-19 pandemic provides an urgent opportunity to investigate the acquisition and propagation of medical knowledge in social networks under conditions of high perceived risk of viral infection. This project uses developments in cognitive psychology, social psychology, and network science to address these critical issues. This cross-disciplinary approach will relate individual-level processes to community-wide acquisition of medical knowledge. Online communities will be assembled, and individuals will engage in a sequence of networked conversations about their knowledge of COVID-19. These interactions will occur using a computer-mediated tool, SoPHIE (Software Platform for Human Interaction Experiments), that allows for seamless communication in conversational networks, designed according to experimenter-specified parameters. Individual knowledge will be measured before and after networked conversations, and the conversational network structure will be manipulated together with the threshold at which people are willing to provide and accept information from others. Advances from this project will be of interest to scientists for modeling optimal information diffusion in social networks and to public health officials interested in disseminating accurate information to the public in their efforts to save lives during times of turmoil.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

711	Arif Mohaimin Sadri	Florida International University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: #COVID-19: Understanding Community Response in the Emergence and Spread of Novel Coronavirus through Health Risk Communications in Socio-Technical Systems	Computer and Information Science and Engineering - Risk perception and risk averting behaviors of vulnerable communities in the emergence and spread of COVID-19 are spatio-temporal functions of individual or group interactions with their online social neighbors within or outside their communities and such interactions need to be captured through diverse information channels (e.g. traditional outlets such as radio, television, internet and/or non-traditional outlets such as social media). The primary goal of this Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project is to collect time-sensitive online social media and crowd-sourced data and analyze patterns of health-risk communication and community response in the emergence and spread of novel Coronavirus using data-driven methods and network science theories. The major focus will be towards understanding how individuals are socially influenced online, while communicating risk and interacting in their respective communities as the disease continues to spread. The notion of influence will be captured by quantifying the network effects on such communication behavior and characterizing how information is exchanged among people who are socially connected online and exposed to health risk in such outbreaks of disease. Given that communities responded to COVID-19 with limited or no preparation and there is uncertainty in the length of recovery for the communities already affected while new communities being threatened, the data collection effort requires rapid response for better coverage and careful monitoring. The data will include large-scale ephemeral online interactions of people in the affected communities and public officials who are involved in COVID-19 response, recovery, and mitigation efforts, followed by a data-driven network analytics and infographics of COVID-19 risk communication strategies and risk averting behaviors adopted. The proposed research will not only expand the knowledge base of spatio-temporal dynamics of risk perception and dissemination strategies in the emergence and aftermath of a major disease outbreak, but will also result in data-driven inference techniques to improve our understanding of how people express diverse concerns and how to harness and embed such information for designing intervention measures. The methodologies and findings of this rapid response research will benefit emergency management and public health agencies to define targeted information dissemination policies for public with diverse needs based on how people reacted to COVID-19 and their social network characteristics, activities, and interactions in response to similar public health hazards.<br/><br/>Public engagement in risk communication can lead to more effective decision-making and enhanced public feedback to the regulatory process. The primary goal of this RAPID project is to mine and analyze large-scale time-sensitive perishable crowd-sourced and social media data (rich spatio-temporal data) and reveal patterns of health-risk communication and community response in the emergence and spread of novel Coronavirus using data-driven methods and network science theories. The specific aims are threefold: (1) to document how public interact and communicate health risk information through their online social networks during a major disease outbreak; (2) to authenticate data from multiple sources and detect anomalies to avoid information overload and spread of misinformation; and (3) to examine how online social networks influence protective actions (e.g., social distancing, self-quarantine decisions) i.e. information cascades in health risk communication. To achieve the goal and aims, the project will utilize ephemeral time and geo-tagged social media interactions of users, agencies, news sources supplemented with crowd-sourced information on COVID-19. This study will have five theoretical and methodological contributions to the literature. It will: (1) advance our understanding of how individuals are socially influenced online, while communicating health risks and interacting in their respective communities as the disease continues to spread; (2) inform the literature on how information is exchanged among people who are socially connected online and exposed to health risk in such outbreaks of disease; (3) use novel machine-learning and network science models to quantify influence and network effects on such communication behavior; (4) capture the variability in network composition, risk communication strategies and risk averting behaviors adopted based on spatio-temporal correlations of risk and disease contagion; (5) ensure authenticity of the collected data from multiple sources and develop more accurate fully-distributed computational algorithms tailored to health risk anomaly detection in socio-technical systems. The findings from this research will be useful to public health and emergency management agencies for tailoring effective information dissemination policies for diverse user groups based on their social network characteristics, activities, and interactions in response to similar public health hazards. The methodologies, and implications of this research can be transferred in designing effective intervention policies to other natural and man-made disaster contexts in which public health risks become major concerns. The project will engage, mentor, and offer an innovative active learning environment for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students by giving priority to disadvantaged and underrepresented communities in USA. The project will train students on computational skills required for collecting, storing, processing, analyzing and modeling large-scale data using high performance computational resources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

With the rapid development of information, communication, and technologies, new data acquisition and assessment methods are needed to evaluate the risk of epidemic transmission and geographic spreading from the community perspective, to help effectively monitor social distancing policies, and to understand social disparities and environmental contexts in risk communication. This project will make theoretical, methodological, and practical contributions that advance the understanding of the COVID-19 spread across both time and space. The communication aspects of this research will serve to educate communities about the science, timing, and geography of virus transmission in order to enhance actions for addressing such global health challenges. This project explores the capabilities and potential of integrating social media big data and geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) technologies to enable and transform spatial epidemiology research and risk communication. Results will be disseminated broadly to multiple stakeholder groups. Further, this project will support both researchers and students from underrepresented groups, broadening participation in STEM fields. Lastly, the Web platform developed in this project will serve as an education tool for students in geography, communication, mathematics, and public health, as well as for effectively engaging with communities about the science of COVID-19. <br/><br/>Past health research mainly focuses on quantitative modeling of human transmission using various epidemic models. How to effectively communicate the science of an epidemic outbreak to the general public remains a challenge. When an epidemic outbreak occurs without specific controls in place, it can be particularly challenging to improve community risk awareness and action. The research team, composed of experts from geography, mathematics, public health and life sciences communication will (1) develop innovative mathematical predictive models that integrate spatio-temporal-social network information and community-centered approaches; (2) integrate census statistics, human mobility and social media big data, as well as policy controls to conduct data-synthesis-driven and epidemiology-guided risk analysis; And (3) utilize panel surveys and text mining techniques on social media data for better understanding public awareness of COVID-19 and for investigating various instant message and visual image strategies to effectively communicate about risks to the public. The results of this project will lead to a better understanding of the geography and spread of COVID-19. Additionally, it is expected that the methods developed in this project can be applied to mitigate the outbreak risks of future epidemics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

This research investigates how to measure changes in collective movement of people in response to the fast-evolving COVID-19 outbreak using large datasets of passively collected location data. It examines how locations within a state respond to public policy implementation and times of critical public messaging. Detailed knowledge on movement patterns of people can help public officials identify hotspots and critically isolated populations, as well as shed light on those groups who continue to travel for work or other purposes. This research contributes to improving the public response to an emergency and contributes to bridging different stakeholder mitigation strategies.<br/><br/>Detailed knowledge of how people respond to a fast-spreading global pandemic is very limited and our understanding of these responses is mostly for small areas. This research will use a near real-time location-based dataset passively collected through the use of location-based apps during the period of pandemic. The project will develop scalable, big location-based algorithms to extract trips and examine the evolution of mobility patterns throughout the pandemic, and identify different mobility patterns. We will develop map-reduce based distributed algorithms to scale up mobility measure calculations based on the big location-based data as well as develop entropy measures to capture the time-varying characteristics associated with the travel patterns, and design strategies to correct biases that may be present in the location data. The methods and results of this research will be useful for understanding mobility during other hazards that affect communities, such as severe flooding to understand how travel is changed as a result of imperatives stemming from both the hazard and policy directives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need for rapid testing, analysis, and tracking. The innovation provides access to next-generation sequence technologies to healthcare facilities, as well as a centralized system to integrate and share hospital-level data with microbial information to be shared on any geographic scale.

715	Andrea Bertozzi	University of California-Los Angeles	None	2020-04-15	2021-03-31	RAPID: Analysis of Multiscale Network Models for the Spread of COVID-19	Mathematical and Physical Sciences - The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has upended the daily lives of more than a billion people worldwide, and governments are struggling with the task of responding to the spread of the disease. Uncertainty in transmission rates and the outcomes of social distancing, "shelter-at-home" executive orders, and other interventions have created unprecedented challenges to the United States health care system. This project will address these issues directly using advanced mathematical modeling from dynamical systems, stochastic processes, and networks. The mathematical models, which are formulated with the specific features of COVID-19 in mind, will provide insights that are critical to people on the front lines who need to make recommendations for intervention strategies and human-behavior patterns to best mitigate the spread of this disease in a timely manner. The project will train a postdoctoral scholar, a PhD student, and two undergraduate students in the research needed to solve these complex problems. <br/><br/>The standard approach for epidemic modeling, at the community scale and larger, is compartmental models in which individuals are in one of a small number of states (for example, susceptible, infected, recovered, exposed, latent), with individuals moving between states. The COVID-19 epidemic can be modeled in this way, with resistance as part of the dynamics. The simplest examples of such models for large populations are coupled ordinary differential equations that describe the fraction of a population in each of the states. To model the stochasticity of infection and latency, models with self-exciting point processes can be fit to real-world data. This project compares the dynamical systems and stochastic models of relevance to COVID-19 transmission. The models also incorporate network structure for the transmission pathways. The project extends prior research on contagions on multilayer networks by incorporating multiple transmission methods and coupling between the spread of the contagion itself and human behavior patterns. The project leverages high-resolution societal mixing patterns in epidemics, as they influence both (1) observations and demographics of who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and (2) who transits the disease, sometimes without being diagnosed.<br/><br/><br/>This award is co-funded with the Applied Mathematics program and the Computational Mathematics program (Division of Mathematical Sciences), and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

716	Sudipta Seal	The University of Central Florida Board of Trustees	None	2020-04-15	2021-03-31	RAPID: Conformal, Anti-viral Nanofilms on Personal Protective equipmenT materials to combat CoronavirUs tRansmission/sequEstration (CAPTURE)	Engineering - In the current state of pandemic COVID 19, use of personal protective equipment e.g. medical gowns, gloves, facemasks, etc.) stand as the primary line of defense for preventing infection. Communication of the pathogen occurs directly, from person to person, as well as through cross-contamination from surface to surface. Current forms of personal protective equipment only provide user protection from infection by functioning as a physical barrier. Incorporation of virus-binding polymers and anti-viral nanomaterials with current forms of personal protective equipment can allow the ?capture? and ?killing? of virus species: protecting medical personnel/first responders and subsequently preventing the spread of contagions, such as the novel coronavirus. This RAPID proposal, supported by the nanoscale interaction program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems, explores the nano-scale interactions between virus species and medically relevant nanomaterials. The project will utilize bio-compatible polymer nanolayers embedded with local UV light emitting nanoparticles as a model system for the future design of nanomaterial-based anti-viral coatings. Results from this study will demonstrate the efficacy of such nanomaterial platforms towards inactivating harmful viral pathogens as well as elucidate virus-biomedical material interactions. Such valuable information will be disseminated to the public for better design of improved and more effective personal protective equipment in the containment of coronavirus and other pathogens.<br/> <br/>Viral pathogens pose a significant threat to humanity. The COVID-19 pandemic typifies this threat with substantial, crippling impact on the global social structures and economics already felt. Current forms of personal protective equipment function solely as physical barriers to infection/viral transmission (e.g. hospital gowns, medical face masks, gloves, etc.). Ideal personal protective equipment should directly inactivate the virus, upon contact: thereby assuring against user infection as well as preventing cross-contamination through surface to surface contact. In this RAPID project, we propose the design of a multi-layer, bio-compatible nano-polymer coating on personal protective equipment surfaces. These layers will further be seeded with complex oxide nanoparticles which absorb white/natural light and release local UV light to inactivate adsorbed virus agents. Additionally, specific polymers in the coating will be chemically modified with virus surface protein binding oligomeric molecules. The advantage of studying such interaction is twofold: (1) surface proteins are blocked from interacting with host cells (preventing infection) and (2) virus species are retained at the personal protective equipment surface allowing sufficient dosing of nanoparticle-mediated UV light. The combination of anti-viral nanoparticles and virus-selective oligomers will function as a model for future, nanomaterial-based, products effecting a ?capture? and ?kill? approach. Specifically, this interdisciplinary study between engineering and biomedical sciences will highlight nanoscale binding interactions (oligomer-protein, polymer-virus membrane) and the efficacy of nano-emitters in anti-viral platforms. The data collected will educate and inform the general public on diverse, relevant subjects; including outreach to various audiences. The model is designed to be highly generalizable to other virus types and for incorporation of nanomaterials with varying chemical, optical, or biological modes of action.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

717	Tanya Rosenblat	University of Michigan Ann Arbor	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Collaborative Research: The Impact of COVID-19 on Norms, Risk-taking, Information, and Trust	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has hit countries around the world hard and is likely to have both short-run and long-run impacts on health behaviors, social norms, and trust in government and other organizations. In the short run, governments and health organizations provide extensive information and recommend behavior to avoid contracting the disease and spreading it to others. This research involves surveys to figure out whether and to what extent people follow recommendations and change behavior. Because the research team has been following a sample of university students for several years, the team already knows a lot about them, and this facilitates an understanding of variation in compliance with recommendations. For example, risk-tolerance and trust in organizations are likely to matter. The team is exploring how people process information about the virus, and how that affects their beliefs about the risks to themselves and others. The researchers also are examining the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on social norms, and how those change over time. The second wave of the study looks for longer run impacts. The results of this study will be useful in shaping future policies and communications about health risks, especially during epidemics and other health crises.<br/> <br/>The researchers make use of previous samples of subjects to test the impact of COVID-19 information and recommendations on behavior, social norms, trust in each other and institutions, and risk-tolerance. They have four areas of study. The first is how how people process ?noisy? information in the context of COVID-19. Prior research by a team member has shown that some individuals tend to misunderstand such information to their benefit. The teams adapt the methodology and protocol of the prior work to examine how individuals interpret COVID-19 information, and how this affects their beliefs about their own vulnerabilities. Second, the team studies the impact of COVID-19 on norms of behavior, including those directly related to the virus (social distancing, hand-washing), as well as norms of trust, sharing and in-group favoritism that may be shifting or newly emerging in response to COVID19. Prior work by a team member developed a methodology for eliciting social norms, and has shown that norms evolve in response to social influence. Third, they explore the impact of COVID-19 on interpersonal trust and trust in institutions, which significantly impacts willingness to follow government and organizational recommendations. Prior work by team members used incentivized games and surveys to study trust and reciprocity in natural disaster settings. Finally, they look at risk perception and risk taking related to COVID-19. Using incentivized measures of risk tolerance, and survey measures of domain-specific risk perceptions and behavior, the team explores the relationship between risk aversion and behavior, but also how the advent of COVID-19 has changed preferences for risk-taking.

718	Rick Wilson	William Marsh Rice University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Collaborative Research: The Impact of COVID-19 on Norms, Risk-taking, Information, and Trust	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has hit countries around the world hard and is likely to have both short-run and long-run impacts on health behaviors, social norms, and trust in government and other organizations. In the short run, governments and health organizations provide extensive information and recommend behavior to avoid contracting the disease and spreading it to others. This research involves surveys to figure out whether and to what extent people follow recommendations and change behavior. Because the research team has been following a sample of university students for several years, the team already knows a lot about them, and this facilitates an understanding of variation in compliance with recommendations. For example, risk-tolerance and trust in organizations are likely to matter. The team is exploring how people process information about the virus, and how that affects their beliefs about the risks to themselves and others. The researchers also are examining the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on social norms, and how those change over time. The second wave of the study looks for longer run impacts. The results of this study will be useful in shaping future policies and communications about health risks, especially during epidemics and other health crises.<br/> <br/>The researchers make use of previous samples of subjects to test the impact of COVID-19 information and recommendations on behavior, social norms, trust in each other and institutions, and risk-tolerance. They have four areas of study. The first is how how people process ?noisy? information in the context of COVID-19. Prior research by a team member has shown that some individuals tend to misunderstand such information to their benefit. The teams adapt the methodology and protocol of the prior work to examine how individuals interpret COVID-19 information, and how this affects their beliefs about their own vulnerabilities. Second, the team studies the impact of COVID-19 on norms of behavior, including those directly related to the virus (social distancing, hand-washing), as well as norms of trust, sharing and in-group favoritism that may be shifting or newly emerging in response to COVID19. Prior work by a team member developed a methodology for eliciting social norms, and has shown that norms evolve in response to social influence. Third, they explore the impact of COVID-19 on interpersonal trust and trust in institutions, which significantly impacts willingness to follow government and organizational recommendations. Prior work by team members used incentivized games and surveys to study trust and reciprocity in natural disaster settings. Finally, they look at risk perception and risk taking related to COVID-19. Using incentivized measures of risk tolerance, and survey measures of domain-specific risk perceptions and behavior, the team explores the relationship between risk aversion and behavior, but also how the advent of COVID-19 has changed preferences for risk-taking. In these ways prior knowledge about the subjects provides an opportunity to study the impact of a national health catastrophe on information processing, social norms, trust and reciprocity and risk-taking.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

As a result, they are the most difficult courses to translate from an in-person learning environment to an online learning environment. Approaches that have achieved some success include web-based simulations of traditional lab exercises and remote access to laboratory equipment. Nevertheless, it is challenging for faculty to design online replacements to their laboratory courses and most never attempted it until forced to do so by the COVID-19 pandemic. In spring 2020, to maximize student safety and provide continued instruction, colleges and universities shifted all courses, including lab courses, to an online format. At this time, fully online teaching and learning will extend through spring semester, and it is possible that it will be necessary for even longer. This circumstance presents a unique, time-sensitive opportunity to measure the impact of the sudden, forced transition on teaching and learning in undergraduate physics lab courses. This project will apply qualitative and quantitative approaches to study impacts of the shift on students and identify strategies used to develop online versions of in-person physics lab activities. <br/><br/>The investigator will use both quantitative and qualitative methods to explore how online labs affect students? understanding of physics and identify the approaches used by physics laboratory instructors to shift to an online learning environment. The project has two specific aims: (1) to measure the effects of the transition on students' learning and knowledge in physics and their expectations about how experimental physics works; and (2) to identify and categorize the strategies taken by physics instructors to enable students to remotely experience laboratory-like learning. For the quantitative component of the study, the Investigator will use the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey for Experimental Physics (E-CLASS), an established survey that her research group has previously developed and tested. The 30 questions in E-CLASS assess students' views about their strategies, habits of mind, and attitudes when doing experiments in physics lab classes. E-CLASS assigns scores to students based on their ratings of how closely their personal views align with those of experts, as well as how an experimental physicist would respond. The pre-instruction E-CLASS was administered in 51 courses involving over 6,000 students this year. Thus, this project will allow analysis of the midterm transition to remote instruction on a large scale. The investigator will add supplemental questions to the post-instruction E-CLASS, as well as administer an instructor survey, to specifically probe the transition to remote labs. The additional questions and the instructor survey will allow the investigator to: (a) analyze which variables in remote teaching most impact E-CLASS scores; (b) compare lab teaching using remote instruction to lab teaching during previous semesters; (c) categorize tools used by instructors during the transition to remote labs; and (d) find common themes, challenges, and successes that will inform the qualitative component of the study. The qualitative component will involve interviews with both faculty and students to develop a case study that captures the details of the transition to remote labs. This project aims to build a better understanding of how the physics lab environment (including social interactions) contributes to students' views about the nature of experimentation and what it means to do experiments. These results will help education researchers who wish to study the advantages and limitations of different lab environments and remote strategies. In addition, the cataloging of different approaches to transitioning lab courses to remote learning will help increase instructors' knowledge of creative practices that they could use for lab courses both during an emergency and outside of one. With this knowledge, they might, for example, be able to increase opportunities for students who have limited access to in-person lab instruction such as students in rural areas.

Panic buying has been evident among consumers all over the world, incurring substantial costs to the buyer, the society, and the marketplace. Hoarding and stockpiling creates shortage of supplies for necessities, depriving others who might be needing them the most in the situation (e.g., health care providers, older individuals), and artificially hikes price levels. For the panic buyer, this behavior creates inventory management problems. This research focuses on the consumer psychology of panic buying and how the media, policy makers, government officials and retailers can frame their communication with the general public at times of such unprecedented events, aiming to mitigate the psychological triggers of this behavior. The current research illuminates the psychological remedies of panic buying, and prescribes actions that may protect the supply chain, ensure equal distribution of necessities among the population, control price hikes of necessities, and extend consumers? financial well-being in pandemic like situations.<br/> <br/>This research is two interrelated studies aimed at tackling the problem of panic buying owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. The first study explores the underlying psychological processes of panic buying during the ongoing crisis. Through an online survey, a U.S. national pool of 2750 respondents provides measures of relevant psychological factors and proneness to panic buying. The second study uses findings from the first study to develop communication frames and materials. The researcher then randomly assigns respondents to different conditions and evaluates the efficacy of the different conditions to reducing panic buying and hoarding.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by DRMS and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

721	Mary Watson	Citadel Military College of South Carolina	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	RAPID: Impacts of Unprecedented Shift to Online Learning on Students' Cognitive Load and Readiness for Self-Directed Learning	Education and Human Resources - Engineering students learn to become engineers through a curriculum of challenging, carefully sequenced courses. Disruption of this sequence may lead to poor performance, exit from the major or college, and extended time to graduation. These negative student outcomes could in turn damage national economic competitiveness by limiting the number of engineers available to enter the workforce. This project will gather time-sensitive data to investigate the impact of the rapid shift to online instruction due to COVID-19. In contrast to their highly structured in-person classes. virtual environments place much greater responsibility on students to manage their own learning, As a result, undergraduate students, including those at military academic institutions such as the Citadel, are experiencing increased mental demands (i.e. cognitive load) as they tackle the rigors of engineering coursework, while simultaneously exercising self-directed learning skills. This project will gather and analyse data about the impact of online courses on the cognitive load and self-directed learning readiness of Citadel engineering students. This information has the potential to be broadly applicable to undergraduate engineering education, as well as to other STEM disciplines and to education levels before and beyond college.<br/><br/>The project focuses on a unique and under-represented population of engineering students who, under normal circumstances, must complete military training in addition to satisfying academic requirements. Students? cognitive load and self-directed learning readiness will be measured using established survey instruments and student focus groups before and after the shift to online learning, as well as after the return to on-campus operations. Three research questions, undergirded by cognitive load theory, will guide the investigations: (1) How do students? cognitive loads and/or self-directed learning readiness differ between in-person and online course? (2) To what extent are changes in self-directed learning readiness associated with changes in cognitive load? (3) Which demographic factors (if any) impact changes in cognitive load and self-directed learning readiness? The project team will use a mixed methods approach to analyze the qualitative and quantitative data collected from surveys and focus groups to determine the magnitude and duration of changes in students? cognitive load and self-directed learning readiness. Findings from the proposed work have the potential to advance knowledge related to students? online learning experiences that can aid in improving course offerings as part of regular instruction, as well as situations in which continuity of instruction is threatened. The intellectual merit of the project lies in its potential to contribute to foundational knowledge relating to issues of sudden and drastic shifts in educational environments as experienced by diverse students at a military institution. The broader impacts of the project lie in its potential to gather time-sensitive data that will permit significant contributions to our understanding of how undergraduate military student learners adapt to disruptive change in their learning environments.

723	David Hanauer	Indiana University of Pennsylvania Research Institute	None	2020-05-01	2022-04-30	RAPID: Instructional Shifts in Response to the COVID-19 and Their Impacts on Classroom-based Undergraduate Research Experiences	Education and Human Resources - Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) greatly expand opportunities for students to participate in authentic research early in their academic career. Research participation is linked to increased student persistence in STEM, especially for students from groups that are underrepresented in STEM. Thus, by increasing the number and diversity of students who have a research experience, CURES also broaden participation in STEM careers. CURES typically engage student teams in hands-on work in laboratories or field sites. With the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, the national CURE education landscape quickly and dramatically changed to a fully ?online? mode, with limited opportunity for advance planning. Thus, this situation presents a unique and urgent opportunity to explore how CUREs evolve in a new online environment, as well as whether they continue to achieve core CURE educational goals. It also allows for assessment of whether these rapid course changes have equitable outcomes for all students, including first-generation students, students on financial aid, and from different socioeconomic backgrounds. If CUREs are a solution for engaging large numbers of early-stage undergraduates in authentic STEM research, then the feasibility to translate CUREs online must be known. It is important to understand the structure of these newly online CUREs, in what situation they are effective, and who they benefit. The results of this project have the potential to expand understanding of CURE instructional approaches and outcomes, for both practitioners and researchers. Additionally, this unexpected shift to online coursework is an opportunity to engage broader higher education audiences in new thinking about course configuration, online effectiveness, and supports and barriers for online teaching.<br/><br/>The purpose of this project is twofold: 1) capture and analyze how CURE course activities are rapidly translated into online formats; and 2) assess effects of course changes on students with different demographic profiles. It will provide early evidence to answer if, how, and why CURE benefits are realized through the different modality of online teaching. Importantly, this project will not make conclusions about the quality of online CUREs or online teaching overall; instead, it will explore which CURE activities can be readily delivered online, how they get delivered, how students respond, and how this new way of teaching changes/expands how instructors think about CUREs. The present project will use a mixed-methods design to track online implementation of CURE courses in two samples. The first sample will include a diverse set of local CUREs that span multiple STEM departments and have an array of course objectives/structures. This collection of CUREs will afford an in-depth, qualitative case study investigation that will capture and analyze instructors? thinking, plans, and products, before, during, and after the shift from hands-on, laboratory-based CUREs to ones that are now abruptly online. The second sample will include CURE courses from a national network, which will allow us to explore more broadly and in a more quantitative way, how a large number of instructors transitioned to online. The project will also examine the resulting emotions, motivations, and experiences of students during this transition and how this semester?s student outcomes compare to those from prior years, through analysis of a historical student outcomes database. This approach will provide broad reach and comparison among a relatively homogenous set of CUREs, since all CURE instructors in this network are trained in the same research approach, have similar course objectives, and use similar materials.

724	Stacey Doan	Claremont McKenna College	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: The COVID-19 Pandemic and Changes in the Stress Response: Identifying Risk and Resilience in Adults and Children	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - For families with young children, the COVID-19 pandemic constitutes a major life stressor that is accompanied by heightened daily demands, including lack of childcare, altered work expectations, job insecurity, and social distancing. All of these are compounded by pressing concerns about the direct and indirect impacts of the disease on family members? health. An abundance of research has documented the negative effects of stress and instability within families and on child development in particular. There is relative lack of data, however, on factors that may protect children against the effects of such an unprecedented set of stressors. The current study will evaluate risk and resilience factors that influence how families respond to the stress, and identify family characteristics and parenting behaviors that promote children?s well-being, focusing on those from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds who are most impacted by these unprecedented threats to health and social stability. <br/><br/>Prospective studies investigating the effects of a pandemic on psychological and physiological functioning in U.S. families have the potential to greatly contribute to our understanding of how children and adults cope with stress. The current study will capitalize on an ongoing longitudinal study of stress and adaptation in families with young children. The research will address fundamental questions about the effects of a chronic stressor on psychological adjustment, as well as the biological mechanisms by which stress affects health. Importantly, by examining patterns of socialization and variation in parenting, results of the study will highlight parental behaviors that may be protective. Utilizing a multi-method approach, the study incorporates questionnaire, and observational and physiological assessments, during the early period of the pandemic and approximately six months later. Comparing these data to those collected prior to the pandemic onset will allow modeling of trajectories, and the possibility of testing mediating and moderating mechanisms. The study will examine not only longitudinal change and individual variability in stress physiology and well-being, but also stress proliferation within families and the extent to which self-regulatory competencies and positive parenting including emotion socialization buffer against negative outcomes in children.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

725	Merlin Bruening	University of Notre Dame	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Collaborative Research: Enabling the Development of COVID-19 Vaccines, Therapeutics and Diagnostics through innovations in Measurement Science	Engineering - This broader impacts of this proposed RAPID proposal is to provide critically enabling measurement science tools to government, industry and academic professionals engaged in mitigating the effects of COVID-19 through work from the NSF Industry-University Cooperative Research Center for Bioanalytic Metrology (CBM). Researchers at Indiana University have developed unique instrumentation to determine the composition of very large particles such as viruses, and they will characterize viruses, vaccine candidates, and antibodies bound to viral particles. Making this unique instrumentation generally available to researchers working on COVID-19 vaccines across the national network of government, industry and academic researchers will quickly address the measurement science problems that will inevitably arise during the race to develop a safe and reproducible vaccine. In parallel, the CBM will address challenges of rapid antibody tests that are not quantitative nor highly sensitive, and typical lab-based methods for determining antibody concentrations are long and cumbersome. Researchers at the University of Notre Dame and Purdue University will develop devices to rapidly quantify the amount of COVID-19 antibodies in patient serum. Such analyses are vital for low-cost examination of antibody levels (and hence immunity) over time. The proposed devices will exploit a combination of innovative antibody capture technology developed at Notre Dame, which provides enhanced signals, and Purdue University?s expertise in the development of point-of-care diagnostic devices. These measurements will be important for investigating the problem of fading immunity and determining if convalescent plasma from a given patient is appropriate for therapeutic studies. <br/><br/>The proposed RAPID research aims to provide fundamental knowledge of the structure of COVID-19 and its elicited antibody response. Analytical and measurement science support of vaccine and biomolecular therapeutic research is notoriously difficult. The molecules in question are often too big and complex for standard characterization methods, and many questions about heterogeneity, stoichiometry and structure cannot easily be answered. Researchers will use advancements in Charge Detection Mass Spectrometry (CDMS) and Ion Mobility Spectrometry (IMS) to study the heterogeneity, stoichiometry, structure and interactions of viral protein assemblies and to provide essential measurements for characterizing newly developed vaccine and therapeutic candidates for COVID-19. The CDMS and IMS tools at the CBM are unique and will allow researchers to directly observe inactivated viruses, 'dummy' viral particles without nucleic acids, bioconjugates containing immunogens on a hapten carrier, oligonucleotides, antibodies complexed to target proteins, and antibodies bound to viral particles. These instruments are starting to revolutionize the analysis of bioconjugations, vaccine development, gene therapies and protein therapeutics. Development of devices for rapidly examining antibody titer will rely on antibody capture in porous membranes that have a long pathlength for sensitive optical detection and a high surface area to volume ratio that enables efficient antibody capture. Device design will exploit expertise in the development of thin strip microfluidic diagnostics. Based on the fluorescence intensity of captured secondary antibodies, these devices will provide a measure of the abundance of different classes of COVID-19 antibodies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

726	Wei Wang	University of California-Los Angeles	None	2020-06-01	2021-05-31	RAPID: Dynamic Graph Neural Networks for Modeling and Monitoring COVID-19 Pandemic	Computer and Information Science and Engineering - The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has become one of the biggest pandemics in human history and has generated lasting impacts on public health, society, and economy. The number of cases in the United States has passed 1 million with a total number of deaths over 50 thousand. There is an urgent need for research and development that can bring a predictive understanding of the spread of the virus, thereby enabling mitigation methods to alleviate the negative effects of COVID-19. Traditional epidemiological models usually take into consideration only a small number of features in building a prediction model, which may not be able to capture potential risk factors and effects of various intervention mechanisms of this new pandemic. In this project the investigators develop novel machine learning methods that can simultaneously model and predict the COVID-19 spread, detect and monitor risk factors, and evaluate effectiveness of interventions over time and space. <br/><br/>The new model ingests and integrates heterogeneous and rapidly accumulating data across diverse sources, such as publications, news, census, social media, and outbreak observation trackers. It employs a new contextualized language model to accurately recognize named entities and relations from vast text data and build knowledge graphs to extract potential risk factors. A dynamic graph is constructed. Each location node may have a set of static and time-dependent attributes. Events, individual behaviors, social activities, interventions are mapped to activity nodes with edges connecting to the corresponding location nodes at the time. A novel dynamic graph neural network is trained to perform joint predictions of all locations over time. Activity nodes of significant attention weights represent major risk factors or effective intervention mechanisms. The project will result in public dissemination of the prediction model and all source codes, immediately benefiting the combat against COVID-19.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

This project studies atomically tailored ceramic surface coatings by examining ionic exchange, dielectric properties, and physical texturing. Surface activated ceramic particles are interesting due to their biocompatible nature and effective antigerm activity. The size, shape, and morphology of the particles also impact antigerm responses. The possible mechanisms for antiviral activity include both atomic-scale physical and chemical interactions with the virus' body including spike, coating, and capsid. Chemical interactions include photo-activation of the particles, the formation of reactive oxygen species, and metal ion release, while physical interactions include membrane disruption and mechanical damage to the virus. This research applies advanced indirect and direct techniques to study the interaction of the ceramic with the virus at multiple length scales. This project is especially timely for the protection of multiple surfaces, since the US will reopen in the coming months. The project involves teamwork among scientists, engineers, educators, and industry experts. Training the next generation of the workforce with the ability to grasp the philosophy of convergence is another key outcome of this project.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: Coronavirus particles have spike proteins (S-proteins) that are responsible for the attachment to the host cells. Specifically, in humans, the SARS and SARS-CoV-2 species have been shown to interact with the host cell receptor protein ACE2 (a zinc metalloprotein). This virus-cell binding is controlled by the polar interaction between the protein molecules. This research project focuses on using polar ceramic-based structures for the capture and deactivation of the coronavirus. Ionic ceramic solids show intrinsic polarity due to the unique arrangement of atoms across different crystalline facets. For example, the alternate basal planes along [0001] direction contain two separate atoms, which lead to intrinsic polarity. The central hypothesis of this research is that ionic surface defects and the polarity on the surface of ceramic particles benefit the effective capture of coronavirus particles and their subsequent deactivation through ionic modulation. Characterization techniques such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are being used for the analysis of physical defects. The effect of ionicity on capture and deactivation is being tested via indirect and direct methods. The indirect testing protocol includes inoculation of the surfaces with virus particles and then measuring the number of infectious virus particles. Successful findings are being applied to hard and porous surfaces for aerospace, automotive, retail, and other critical industry sectors.<br/><br/>This grant is being awarded using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supplement allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Cleaner, fishable and swimmable urban rivers would be another justification for sustainable living practices that entail much less driving, including working from home (telecommuting), remote education, increased on-line shopping and delivery, and enhanced public transportation. These urban-living practices are inevitable, but the COVID-19 pandemic could potentially accelerate these practices into near-term living scenarios. The information will be useful to urban planners regarding green infrastructure needed for cleaning urban water, and to public health officials and legislators for managing urban water. Additionally, recent trends for manufacturing, urban development, traffic design, and public transportation mean the historical data on urban water quality may no longer describe current conditions. Thus, continued study is critically necessary to ensure a future clean, resilient water supply, as well as a healthy urban river ecosystem. <br/><br/>The project team will collect perishable water quality and flow data from urban streams and waterways during COVID-19 and evaluate the impact of reduced traffic by analyzing this data in combination with long-term, infrequent, historical data, as well as more frequent post-pandemic data collected for this study. The team will collect data on traffic-based pollutants, including heavy metals, selected organics (PAH, BTEX), total-dissolved solids, basic water-quality parameters, and macro-organisms that respond rapidly to pollution. Chosen sites are representative of the urban spectrum, and also are likely to be impacted by future stay-at-home living practices. Results will be scaled up to the city-scale using mass-balance hydrological and water quality models in combination with GIS-based traffic data. The data collected can be used in combination with complex hydrological and traffic models to evaluate numerous scenarios associated with future urban living practices.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Hydrologic Sciences and Environmental Sustainability programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

729	David Watkins	Michigan Technological University	None	2020-06-01	2021-05-31	RAPID: COVID-19, Consumption, and Multi-dimensional Analysis of Risk (C-CAR)	Engineering - The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed household dynamics and dramatically changed food, energy, and water consumption within the home. Stay-at-home orders and social distancing has caused U.S. households to shift to working and schooling from home, curtail outside activities, and stop eating in restaurants. Furthermore, as many households face job loss and increasing home utility and grocery bills, U.S. residents are experiencing the economic impacts of the crisis, while at the same time assessing and responding to health risks. The project team has a unique opportunity to study these shifting household consumption and behavioral responses and quantify the associated economic and environmental impacts. The team will collect household food, energy, and water consumption data as well as survey response data from 180 participating households in one Midwestern county and compare it to data collected before the stay-at-home orders were put in place. Questions are being added to previously administered monthly surveys to study participants regarding their perceptions and behavioral responses to COVID-19, including changes in household consumption habits and travel behavior, information sources, and health risk perceptions and responses. With this data, the team will be able to produce timely research results that inform current and future response policies to ensure food, energy, and water security in times of public health crises.<br/><br/>This first-of-its-kind study will investigate how household behavior changes in response to sudden exogenous events like pandemics, the persistence of those changes over time, and the environmental impacts of changing consumption dynamics. Results will offer novel insights on longitudinal processes in household sense-making, risk response, behavior change under crisis, and persistence. Specifically, the data can provide insight into i) how the pandemic is shaping household consumption and COVID-19 related behavioral responses, and the persistence of these changes over time; ii) the environmental impacts of changing consumption patterns, and the implications if changes persist; iii) how behavioral responses vary based on socio- demographics, perceptions of risks, information networks, and institutional trust; and iv) how pandemic perceptions and responses correlate with those associated with other socio- environmental risks such as climate change. Outcomes from this study will improve understanding of how to identify and address the material and emotional risks U.S. residents are facing under this crisis. Identifying changes in household economics and challenges to provisioning food, energy, and water can improve the collective ability to aid households in responding to these ongoing challenges and mitigate future shocks to supply systems. In addition, empirical evidence of consumption changes that benefit the environment and that households can readily adapt into their routines may provide important insights on potential pathways towards sustainability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

The impacts of this disruption on STEM education is anticipated to be substantial. A 2014 study by the National Research Council found that field experiences boost motivation, retention, critical thinking and academic success for students of all backgrounds and disciplines and are particularly important for recruitment into the environmental sciences. Building on a grassroots effort of 50 Field Stations and Marine Laboratories representing 34 field site networks (e.g., NEON, LTER, LTAR, GLEON), this project will leverage existing collaborations, programs and initiatives to: establish a field learning portal to advertise and distribute virtual materials and live-streaming research-based field events to universities across the U.S.; create novel cross-site virtual field learning experiences that boost critical observation and research skills; evaluate the efficacy of virtual field experiences on student learning outcomes. These experiences will help fulfill graduation requirements and prepare undergraduates and graduates impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic for future careers.<br/><br/>This pandemic offers unique opportunities to generate insights for the development of virtual field experiences as a novel teaching tool. The urgent need for virtual teaching materials across all disciplines encourages adoption by faculty who might otherwise never have used either virtual or field experiences in their courses. The synchronous prioritization of virtual offerings by field stations and marine laboratories opens the window to creating a broad array of multi-site virtual experiences around the world. The resulting dramatic expansion in the availability and use of virtual field experiences can create new opportunities to assess the effects of this teaching tool on student observation and research skills and to enhance preparedness for future disruptions.

This project is investigating the effect of fishing on an estuarine food web. In the oyster reef food chain, newly settled oysters are eaten by crabs, and the crabs are in turn eaten by fish. More fish predators mean fewer crabs and more oysters. Fish also reduce foraging by crabs, which further benefits oysters. Although small-scale experimental studies have measured the impact of fish exclusion on oyster reefs, the links between fishing, fish populations and oyster reefs require an estuary-scale experiment. Stay-at-home orders associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has curtailed fishing activity throughout estuaries. This project combines empirical experiments and fisheries monitoring data from before, during and after COVID-19-related restrictions to investigate how changes in fishing activity influence oyster reef food webs. Building on 10+ years of preexisting observations the dataset encompasses a 100-year flood, a hurricane, and now a pandemic, a rare opportunity to investigate the effects of low fishing pressure in the absence of other disturbances. The broader impacts of this study contribution of data towards optimizing management and conservation of marine resources. Oyster reefs are essential habitat that perform ecosystem services such as water filtration and shoreline stabilization, but they are also harvested as a commercial fishery. Interest in estuarine systems for recreation and fishing is high along the Gulf of Mexico. Public displays and outreach activities at the Dauphin Island Sea Lab will include results from this project to increase awareness of the effect of human activity on local ecosystems.<br/><br/>The loss of top predators can destabilize ecosystems by making them more prone to invasions, altering nutrient fluxes within and between habitats, and impeding recovery after disturbances. Overfishing reduces the abundance of higher order predators, leading to higher abundances of intermediate consumers or mesopredators. Mesopredator release can increase predation pressure on basal trophic levels, including foundation species. In estuaries, fin fish, many of which are targeted by both commercial and recreational anglers, provide an important trophic link and their removal or experimental exclusion can trigger mesopredator release. However, the extent that fishing alters communities remains poorly understood. Estuarine systems along the Gulf of Mexico have experienced nearly continuous and widespread exploitation for over a century, and the few examples of temporary releases from fishing pressure have co-occurred with other natural disasters. The COVID-19 pandemic has curtailed fishing and has provided a unique research opportunity. Using a Before After Control Impact (BACI) design, the effects of fishing pressure on top-down control is being investigated in a model system, oyster reefs. Fishing activity and fish stock assessments are compared with field experiments to determine top predator feeding activity, mesopredator abundances, and recruitment and growth of oysters. To gauge changes in the structure of estuarine food webs, the data are being compared with 10+ years of preexisting results to isolate the effect of fishing activity from confounding factors associated with natural disasters like hurricanes and floods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

ABCD consists of a Coordinating Center, a Data Analysis and InformaticsResource Center, and 21 research sites across the U.S. ABCD has enrolled a diverse sample of 11,878 9-10year-olds, and is tracking their biological and behavioral development through adolescence into youngadulthood. All participants receive repeated state-of-the-art neuroimaging, neuropsychological testing,bioassays, and detailed youth and parent assessments of substance use, mental health, physical health, andculture and environment.In March 2020, when our participants are ages 11-13, the world became substantially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to an upheaval in the economy and the lives of almost every family. The majority of U.S.schools closed to reduce viral spread. Many parents incurred changes in work (from home, longer shifts,reduced wages, and/or job loss), some services and support systems became disrupted, and case counts anddeath tolls surge. The massive multifaceted impact of this unprecedented event has the potential to affect fordecades those who are currently children. The proposed research immediately leverages the ABCD cohort,infrastructure, and existing protocol to rapidly characterize the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on eachchild in the study. By collecting this situational information as soon as possible, we can use existing ABCD datato examine perturbations in developmental trajectories of brain functioning, cognition, substance use,academic achievement, social functioning, and physical and mental health.The proposed project would query all ABCD participants and their parents multiple times about the impact ofthe pandemic on their lives and, in a subset of participants, examine their physical activity and sleep objectivelywith activity trackers (Fitbits), over the months of school closures, job loss, and disease spread. This will allowthe consortium and scientific community at large to test multiple aims regarding how various facets of thepandemic affect development. This includes: (1) characterizing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on brainand cognitive development and onset of substance use; (2) evaluating the extent to which alternative schoolingapproaches exacerbate or mitigate the impact of the pandemic on brain and cognitive development andsubstance use outcomes; and (3) evaluating the extent to which family stressors exacerbate or mitigate theimpact of the pandemic on neurobiological, cognitive, and substance use outcomes. This unprecedented crisisprovides an opportunity to make use of ABCD's elaborate infrastructure and rigorous scientific processes todiscern critical dimensions of development not previously envisioned.

First, we do not know what the disease is yet; we are still learning a great deal about what it causes in humans. We do not know what treatments to give, what risk factors are present for severe disease, and how long people are sick. We are proposing a national observational study of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, with an embedded randomized clinical trial of an antiviral agent. The observational study will build on work that we have been doing for the past four years, with pre-established protocols and data collection infrastructure just for this purpose. The randomized clinical trial will be with global collaborators to make sure that Canadian patients inform the world, and vice versa, about how to best treat this new disease. Alongside this, we will conduct surveys of clinicians, researchers, and the public about how they understand this new outbreak, how they feel about participating in research during a major outbreak, and what should be done differently; all of which will inform our clinical studies. Finally, we have been asked by the WHO to conduct a formal guideline for the management of COVID-19, which we will perform as data begins to emerge from the clinical trials that are ongoing. All of these proposals, put together, create a suite of approaches to better understanding and managing a new infection.

The collaborative research is conducted by a multi-disciplinary team of virologists, chemists, infectious disease specialists, front-line practitioners, and public health researchers from the University of Alberta, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, and Wuhan Institute of Virology (China). The immediate priority focuses on developing two complementary techniques to be performed on-site and in resource-limited settings, in support of rapid diagnosis of COVID-19. The diagnostic innovation takes advantage of the most recent advances in chemistry, molecular biology, genome technology, and nanotechnology. Chemical reactions required for efficient amplification and sensitive detection of the viral RNA take place in a single tube at a moderate temperature, simplifying the operation procedures. The specific reaction products are visible to the naked eyes, thus eliminating the need for any elaborate equipment. The first test reads color changes, with red color indicating negative and blue color indicating positive. Readout for the second test is color band on paper strips, similar to those of pregnancy tests, with two red bands indicating positive whereas a single control band indicating negative. The mid-term priority focuses on validating and evaluating the new diagnostic tests for field applications in the epidemic center of COVID-19. Our team members in Wuhan who currently perform the standard diagnostic tests will lead this effort. Once validated and approved, the new diagnostic tools will be used to support screening and diagnosis of COVID-19 at the community level. The mid-term objective also includes adapting the point-of-care diagnostics at other collaborating sites, e.g., Karachi (Pakistan) and Nairobi (Kenya). A longer-term priority of this research includes refining the new diagnostic tools to enable monitoring of mutational changes of the virus as it continues to evolve.

The strategies need to be as vast as possible since we do not yet know if vaccines or other antiviral drugs will be efficacious. Our group had previously shown in the context of influenza infection that the human host has cell-surface proteases (called type II transmembrane serine proteases or TTSPs) that the virus requires in order to cleave a viral surface protein called hemagglutinin, itself essential for the virus to gain entry into the cell and further replicate using the host cell machinery. We had shown that small molecules inhibiting the activity of lung epithelial cell proteases were efficacious at significantly reducing influenza virulence demonstrating novel anti-viral properties of the compounds. The situation is similar with the SARS-CoV-2 virus but the protein found on the surface of the virus is different. This protein is called the spike glycoprotein (or S protein) and it requires cleavage by human host cell proteases of the TTSP family for its virulence. Our proposal will test protease inhibitors in models where cells are expressing the S protein and the most potent molecules will then be validated in lung organoids to verify their efficacy at reducing viral propagation. We have put together a team of molecular pharmacologists, chemists and virologist with access to containment level 3 facilities to rapidly assess the potential anti-viral properties of the compounds that we already have on hand. In addition, our team will be supported by Dr. Gary Whittaker, Cornell University, one of the world's experts in coronavirus biology. We believe that these conditions are very favorable for us to have a quick impact in the field and to deliver novel antiviral compounds for patients with COVID-19.

Infection causes respiratory disease that can progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress and even death. Often patients require hospitalization and intensive care, which increases the chance of viral spread within health care settings. Since it was first identified there have been over 69000 cases, and 1600 deaths, and the virus has spread to multiple countries. Currently, there are no vaccines or therapeutics, but these are urgently needed to bring the epidemic under control. Our proposal seeks to address these areas of need by a multifaceted approach. Specifically, the objectives of this proposal include: 1) Isolation of virus and generation of an in vitro reverse-genetics COVID-19 system 2) Identification of neutralizing antibodies 3) Development and evaluation of candidate vaccines Additionally, the project will generate data on the safety of candidate vaccines in humans through a phase I trial. This will help determine which vaccines can be advance for further study. This will be accomplished through synergistic research between the biotechnology companies Medicago and Inovio in conjunction with several academic research laboratories. Dr. Kobinger's group has an established track record of translational research, and has successfully brought a DNA-vaccine against MERS-CoV to phase I clinical trials 24 months after commencing the project and in less than 7 months for Zika virus. He has led multinational collaborations in the past, and has a history of promoting collaborative and transparent consortium-based research programs. This proposal will develop tools that can be shared with the world scientific community that will help further our understanding of viral pathogenesis, transmission as well as screen potential small-molecule inhibitors and antibodies. Collectively, the findings from this project have potential to contribute to global response against COVID19.	Canadian Institutes of Health Research	Research Grant	999356.0 CAD

Yet, the existing COVID-19 research roadmap and WHO R&D Blueprint are largely silent on the global ethical pathways required to guide and oversee rapid therapeutics and vaccine R&D in this context (including whether and how such pathways ought to be modified, or precisely what solidarity and equity require for these activities). To identify and successfully navigate these ethical and regulatory pathways for COVID-19 R&D, we can look to the unprecedented R&D response to the 2013-16 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak for guidance. Only five months following the development of the first study protocols for EVD, the first patients were enrolled in clinical trials. Only four years later, the first vaccine was licensed in the United States. The atypical expediency of these R&D efforts was, in part, a product of significant modifications and adaptations to the usual ethical and regulatory pathways for health product development-pathways that involve ethical inputs into study protocols, independent ethics review of studies, global consultation and governance, data sharing agreements, and the approval, licensure, and dissemination of resulting products. This project will for the first time (1) analyze and describe the ethical pathways for R&D that existed or were established for EVD in order to aid the global research community in navigating these pathways for COVID-19 R&D; (2) analyze and describe the ethical pathways as they are established and navigated for COVID-19 R&D in order to rapidly support ongoing and future COVID-19 R&D; and (3) compare and conduct an ethical analysis of the ethical pathways for EVD and COVID-19 R&D to inform future R&D during epidemics.

Building on the expertise, research instruments, and networks developed through the SSHRC-funded Hungry Cities Partnership, our objectives are to: 1) Investigate the immediate food security challenges resulting from China's quarantine measures, unstable food supply, and fear of food shopping in two COVID-19 affected cities (Wuhan and Nanjing); 2) Compare food security status in Nanjing following the COVID-19 outbreak with baseline data collected through Hungry Cities in 2015; and 3) Synthesize and assess policies established to address food security challenges and promote effective measures by engaging local stakeholders. Our Canadian-Chinese research team has strong multidisciplinary expertise in food security evaluation, food policy analysis and the social and food security impacts of infectious diseases. Using a mixed-methods approach, we will generate rapid answers to Objective 1 through an online household survey and follow-up telephone interviews with residents of Wuhan and Nanjing, and a complementary inventory of immediate policy measures. Building on the survey instruments and established connections developed through the Hungry Cities Partnership, we will address Objective 2 through a longitudinal analysis to evaluate changes in household food security before and after the COVID-19 epidemic. Objective 3 will be addressed through a policy analysis and in-depth interviews with diverse local stakeholders. Outcomes will be relevant to academics, international organizations, and policymakers involved in efforts to strengthen food provisioning amid the epidemic in China. Results will also be useful to policymakers in other countries at risk of food security during infection disease outbreaks.	Canadian Institutes of Health Research	Research Grant	438241.0 CAD

Laboratory tests, often based on quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), require equipment, time, expertise and infrastructure, resulting in severe logistical challenges and ultimately resulting in inadequate testing. There is a critical need for diagnostics that can be rapidly deployed at the point-of-need (PON) to enable global surveillance of infectious diseases. Towards addressing this need, this project incorporates a new CRISPR-based approach called CRISPR Isothermal Amplification (CIA) that enables one-pot diagnostic amplification and detection of the SARC-CoV-2 virus at ambient temperatures. This scheme builds off innovations in cell-free synthetic biology and biosensing that enable rapid, low-cost, and PON detection of chemical contaminants and viral pathogens. The platform technology under development could serve several purposes from a quick-screen technology to inform triage and isolation strategies, to a clinical test used on the front lines. There is also the potential for the technology to eventually serve as an at-home test to help inform which subpopulations and sectors of the economy could safely return to productivity towards the end of the pandemic. In addition, the test has the flexibility to be rapidly reprogrammed to detect new emerging pathogens. This work is pursued in close collaboration with a commercial partner, Stemloop, Inc., in order to quickly transition the technology for manufacturing, deployment, and distribution.<br/><br/>This project employs a new CRISPR Isothermal Amplification (CIA) approach to enable a one-pot amplification and detection of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in an assay for the virus. CIA uses programmed Cas 13 systems to recognize SARS-CoV-2 RNA, trigger nucleic acid amplification and create a detectable output simultaneously in the same reaction where amplification occurs. Computational models of each process are developed alongside the experimental systems and used to guide optimizations to achieve attomolar sensitivity. The method is unique in that no DNA primers are required. The amplification and detection processes are designed to take less than one hour and cost less than one dollar per test to manufacture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Understanding the timing and sequence of these policy choices, and those policies? eventual consequences, is critical for assessing how governments can be most effective during pandemics. This project collects data on state and local governments? responses to COVID-19, including policies related to closing schools, canceling travel, banning public gatherings, closing restaurants and bars, delaying rent payments, and rules on medical licenses. This data allows researchers to examine the factors that influence states? policy choices, whether those factors differ from the ways in which states enact policies during normal times, which policies are effective in slowing the spread and morbidity of the virus, and how states roll back policies in a manner that allows economic activity to resume while maintaining preparedness to avoid and mitigated waves of the virus. <br/><br/>This project collects data on state government responses to COVID-19 by scraping government websites daily, focusing on sites dedicated to COVID-19 and those associated with the executive branch, state legislatures, and state departments of public health. It also collects data on the number of diagnosed cases, fatalities, recoveries in the states, and mobility data that tracks geographic movements from mobile phones. The policy recommendations or decisions recorded from state government pages include decisions related to closing schools, canceling travel, banning public gatherings (and their size), closing restaurants and bars, travel quarantines, postponing elections, safe shelter orders, limiting elective medical procedures, as well as when states modify these policies; additional data is collected from official state Twitter accounts. This data allows researchers to examine the factors that influence states? policy choices, whether those factors differ from the ways in which states enact policies during normal times, which policies are effective in slowing the spread and morbidity of the virus, and how states roll back policies in a manner that allows economic activity to resume while maintaining preparedness to avoid and mitigated waves of the virus. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Accountable Institutions and Behavior Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Increased case detection, contact tracing, and broad quarantine and social distancing measures, have been vital for containing COVID-19 outbreaks. Mathematical modeling and analysis can provide important insights into the efficacy of these ?contact-based? non-pharmaceutical interventions. However, model parameterization requires detailed case data, which is often challenged by inconsistent, unreported and asymptomatic cases. To overcome these difficulties, the researchers will: develop outbreak models of COVID-19 with quarantine, tracing and social distancing and derive new results on final epidemic size and reproduction number under quarantine measures to flatten and shrink the epidemic curve. The researchers will also integrate case and phylogenetic data for an innovative framework that reveals region-specific control and predicts how to best implement contact-based measures for efficiently containing the outbreaks. Results will be communicated with policymakers, along with scientific and public audiences, in order to have a real-time impact on the coronavirus pandemic.<br/><br/>This project will consider compartmental outbreak models of COVID-19 with responsive quarantine, tracing and social distancing measures. The novel formulation allows for derivation of outbreak size, dependent on contact tracing and broad quarantine intervention parameters. Reproduction number estimates and model fitting of case, tracing and quarantine data will quantify region-specific control characteristics. Sensitivity of epidemic size to combinations of contact tracing and social distancing measures will be assessed to understand viable strategies for flattening and shrinking epidemic curves. Long term scenarios of loosening and tightening of quarantine interventions for sustainable control will be investigated through analysis and simulation of the models. In addition, through interdisciplinary collaboration, the researchers will incorporate multi-region stochastic versions of the epidemiological models with phylodynamic computations of genomic data to improve model projections in the presence of possible unknown chains of transmission and area-specific responsive interventions. A ?forward simulation-backward coalescent? approach will track migration events and produce phylogenetic tree signatures for matching model simulations to phylogenetic data. The overall combined phylodynamic and epidemic model analysis will quantify heterogeneous disease spread and contact-based control efficacy to inform public health authorities.<br/><br/><br/>This award is being funded by the CARES Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

This project addresses both risk factors through focused experiments and data from two labs in an active feedback loop with mathematical modeling, simulations, and theory. The mathematical effort will provide a platform, starting from a baseline model and simulation of exposure to inhaled COVID-19 without Ab protection. The baseline model will distinguish clearance of the inhaled viral load versus onset and propagation of respiratory infection. Two experimental interventions will be simulated on top of the baseline model at progressive stages of infection: inhaled doses of COVID-19-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and of structure-targeted mucolytics. Both labs will leverage mathematical predictions to accelerate and optimize their strategies to mitigate COVID-19 disease. Likewise, experimental results and data will be leveraged to validate models and learn hidden factors critical to the predictive accuracy of the models. The potential broader impact of this project is to predict optimal, mAb-based and mucolytic-based treatments for specific sub-populations at various stages of COVID-19 lung infection.<br/><br/>The mathematical modeling platform will explore the delicate interplay among: inhaled loads of COVID-19, their diffusion within, and potentially through, the mucus-coated respiratory tract; infectivity onset as COVID-19 reaches and invades epithelial cells, produces daughters that invade new cells and propagate the infection; how long after exposure to COVID-19 either natural antibodies or engineered mAb are introduced into the mucus layer; and, the rate of clearance of the mucus layer from the lung. The latter clearance rate is known to depend, often dramatically, on structural properties of mucus in vulnerable sub-populations to COVID-19. The experimental team will test outcomes of existing mAb on non-infectious COVID-19 nanoparticles. A multi-species stochastic model will simulate diffusion and propagation of COVID-19, interrupted by mAb-crosslinks between COVID-19 and mucins. Some reaction-diffusion parameters are measured while others will be learned from experimental data using hidden Markov methods. A polymer-physics-based molecular dynamics model of mucus will simulate structure properties of mucus based on the chemical structure and concentrations of mucin polymers known for specific sub-populations. With this modeling platform, the goals are to: optimize mAb design; characterize efficiency of given mAb affinities to COVID-19 and mucus; and quantify the inhaled mAb dose required to arrest COVID-19 infection at various stages of progression, specific to mucus structure properties.<br/><br/>This grant is being awarded using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

754	Matthew Junge	Bard College	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Collaborative Research: Quarantined Networks and the Spread of COVID-19	Mathematical and Physical Sciences - As the global community weighs the necessary extent of quarantine and social distancing to fight the spread of COVID-19, the critical question is how disease transmission is mitigated by these measures. Recent predictions suggest that without serious interventions, a large portion of the world population will become infected, resulting in millions of deaths. To mitigate this worst-case scenario, key policy decisions are being guided by mathematical models. However, several prominent models make unrealistic assumptions about human contacts i.e., that an individual is equally likely to infect a close family member as a complete stranger on the other side of the country. Such assumptions are useful for calculations, but fail to take into account the full geographic complexity of the outbreak. Furthermore, many models do not consider the consequences of the quarantine of healthy individuals. This project will use rigorous analysis and simulation to address these shortcomings by describing a more realistic structure of quarantined networks and how disease spreads in them. The proposed research will use real-world data about contact networks to make predictions and recommendations for controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, improving our understanding of how best to contain the current as well as future pandemics. The project will involve the training of undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This research will describe the effect of quarantine on connectivity and disease transmission on more realistic networks than have previously been considered. Of particular importance will be locating critical thresholds which, when exceeded, allow large epidemics to occur. There is recent study of these thresholds, but for networks that model digital infrastructure and social networks. The first objective of the research will be to determine the effect of biased site percolation on graph structure, especially how different percolation rules influence the size of the largest component of a given graph. The second part will then focus on how the critical threshold and size of the epidemic for an SIR model change after percolation. This will be explored rigorously on graphs generated from the configuration model as well as random spatial networks such as Gilbert graphs. Additionally, these questions will be investigated on real world face-to-face networks using data specific to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Answering them will help test robustness of previous models, while also exploring the effectiveness of stronger preemptive distancing.<br/><br/>This grant is being awarded using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

755	Bernhard Leidner	UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Strategic Science Communication in the COVID-19 Pandemic	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - The COVID-19 pandemic is a global crisis threatening millions of lives, the economy, and national infrastructures, including healthcare, housing markets, and industrial supply chains. Health organizations, government, and local communities have introduced various measures to reduce the impact of the pandemic. In this global context, this project examines and compares people?s compliance with these measures over time, and across diverse cultural and governance contexts. Specifically, it focuses on how different value and belief systems influence (non-)compliance with containment measures as the pandemic unfolds. In doing so, the research enhances basic understanding of science/policy communications and their impact on public attitudes and behaviors. Ultimately, the project helps identify best science communication practices to inform and educate people about COVID-19 and similar crises. <br/><br/>Policies and scientific recommendations aimed to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus have generated critical discussions about the prioritization of collective versus individual values. Tradeoffs often focus on public security and health versus individual autonomy and civil liberties. As a result, large-scale societal crises have the potential to shift value prioritization both during and beyond the crisis. By integrating theories from social and cross-cultural psychology, this research explores the role of different value systems, including basic human values, social values, and cultural values, in public responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. A collaborative research network will collect primary data from representative adult samples at three time points during the pandemic. Changes are tracked in public endorsement of different values over the course of three months. Analyses focus on how these changes predict attitudinal and behavioral responses to policies and scientific recommendations. The project also examines the roles of factors such as the severity of the pandemic, socio-economic condition, and existing value systems in these changes. The research will advance scientific understanding of basic human values, how people respond to science communications, and how best to design such communications to achieve important societal goals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Currently, there are over two million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with nearly 700,000 cases in the United States. Limited testing capacity and asymptomatic infections have resulted in significant unknowns in the actual number of infections by SARS-CoV2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19). Therefore, alternative methods of tracking the SARS-CoV2 are urgently needed. The goal of this RAPID project monitor public health by surveilling SARS-CoV2 presence in wastewater in four cities in CA, NC, Washington DC, and TX. Samples will be gathered before, during, and after infection peaks in these four cities, creating a data collection essential to understanding the current pandemic. Coronavirus levels will be determined using methods that target specific parts of the virus. The wastewater data will be compared to data from the healthcare system to determine if testing wastewater can help predict COVID-19 presence in a community. Knowledge gained from this study will advance the understanding of how wastewater testing can be used to guide healthcare resources to individual communities, reducing long-term economic disruption of the larger community during future outbreaks.<br/><br/>Limited diagnostic testing and asymptomatic infections result in large uncertainty in the actual extent of SARS-CoV2 infections. Analysis of municipal wastewater is equivalent to analyzing a pooled sample from all community members for a community-scale measure of infection dynamics. A coordinated effort across four major geographically diverse metropolitan areas, Orange County, Raleigh, Washington, and DC, Houston will address knowledge gaps in the use of wastewater surveillance as a public health monitoring tool. Raw wastewater and primary solids will be collected from four municipal wastewater treatment plants throughout the infection period to quantify SARS-CoV2, seasonal influenza, and an enteric virus in the samples. Using identical experimental protocols and incorporating other viruses into this analysis will validate and expand the understanding of wastewater surveillance as a public health monitoring tool for various human viruses in addition to SARS-CoV2. The team has public health and wastewater treatment expertise to examine how wastewater data relates to clinical data. The results from this study will help to characterize the full potential of wastewater surveillance as a public health monitoring tool and help prepare public health officials for future outbreaks. Results and methods will be shared in publicly available using FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) protocols to assist the larger network of researchers studying SARS-CoV2 in wastewater.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

To encourage social distancing, many states have closed schools and nonessential businesses and instituted ?Stay-at-Home? orders that limit trips to necessary activities such as grocery shopping and medical care. While Stay-at-Home orders are typically considered mandatory, most states rely on voluntary compliance rather than penalize infractions through citations or arrests. A persistent concern throughout the crisis has been the extent to which individuals are choosing to practice social distancing effectively in order to slow the growth of the pandemic. Yet, to date, virtually no systematic information has emerged on differences in social distancing across social groups by income, race/ethnicity, and residential neighborhood and, critically, why these differences exist. This project will address this gap by collecting detailed data on social distancing practices during the COVID-19 pandemic ? including the timing and location of non-home trips over the course of a week ? from a sample of youth and their caregivers in the Columbus, OH area. The study will build on an ongoing project focused on differences in patterns of everyday activity under normal (non-pandemic) conditions). Enhanced effectiveness of social distancing holds the potential to save millions of lives, reduce the burden to inevitably taxed health care systems during pandemics, and mitigate potential longer-term damage to the US and global economies due to ineffective pandemic containment. Findings from the project will provide crucial guidance to policy-makers who must target interventions to most effectively contain viral outbreaks and address the needs of the most vulnerable populations during pandemics. Findings will also provide important information for epidemiologists who must model disease spread based on realistic assumptions regarding social distancing practices across the population. Finally, clinicians will also benefit from more precise information on infection risk profiles at the individual level. <br/><br/>COVID-19 has prompted requirements for social-distancing, and yet we know little about who complies and who does not. This project will re-contact 246 households (N=309 youth) who participated in an ongoing NIH-funded study of everyday spatial exposures that was in the field in the period prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (the Adolescent Health and Development in Context study). Objective 1 of the study will investigate the association between income, race/ethnicity, and residential neighborhood economic disadvantage and typical (pre-pandemic) exposure to higher infection risk locations as captured by the density of social interaction at those places. These data will shed light on infection risk during the early stages of the pandemic before social distancing behaviors were widely adopted. The study will leverage unique data from the baseline study on the geographic location and associated characteristics of everyday places visited based on a novel survey-based method for the collection of geographically-referenced activity data. Objective 2 of the study will re-administer this location data collection approach during the peak period of the pandemic to measure income, race/ethnicity and neighborhood variation in the extent of social distancing behaviors for both caregivers and youth. Objective 3 will address the consequences of pandemic exposure and social distancing behaviors for economic hardship, mental health, family conflict, and youth behavioral problems. The project will generate the first geographically referenced data on the mobility of youth and their caregivers during pandemics in combination with extensive, high quality social survey data. Findings will inform sociological theories regarding the social and geographic determinants of compliance behavior, which complement psychological investigations more attuned to personality and individual determinants of the same.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

New types of surface treatments that exhibit antipathogenic ?contact-kill? capabilities are urgently sought to protect public health and welfare. To this end, cuprous oxide is reported as a highly effective antimicrobial compound; while the origin of its antimicrobial property remains unknown, it is hypothesized to be a consequence of atomic-level copper vacancies in its crystal lattice that provide highly charged atomic environments. These locally energetic regions in the lattice are thought to disrupt and destroy cell membranes and/or the protein shell of viruses. Interdisciplinary research quantifies connections between the cuprous oxide lattice condition and its biocidal activity to permit rational engineering of this abundant, inexpensive and easily handled material for incorporation into coatings for public spaces.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: Correlations between the cuprous oxide lattice defect condition and its antipathogenic response to representative organisms are quantified through structural and electronic probes, including magnetometry and photoabsorption. Lattice-defective cuprous oxide, synthesized by high-energy mechanical processing, is incorporated into coatings and subjected to biological assays to quantify any reduction in viable bacteria and viruses after prolonged exposure. Students and junior researchers involved in this project work at the typically unfrequented intersection of inorganic materials science and biology. These tests, which are designed to simulate actual conditions where a pathogen might survive on a given surface, provide enabling knowledge to engineer cuprous oxide, and perhaps other oxide materials, for antipathogenic purposes to address the current COVID-19 pandemic and to proactively confront future health challenges.<br/><br/>This award is being funded by the CARES Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

760	Holavanahalli Udaykumar	UNIVERSITY OF IOWA	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: A physics-based model for droplet drying on varying surfaces and changing seasonal conditions and the implications for COVID-19 survival	Engineering - The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in enormous loss of lives and economic damage. Seasonal return of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) will be even more devastating. One of the primary ways that SARS-CoV-2 appears to spread is through people touching surfaces with virus-laden droplets. Virus survivability on surfaces varies greatly by droplet size and composition, surface material and texture, and the ambient temperature and relative humidity. These factors impact the concentration of salt and other solutes in the process of droplets drying on surfaces, which strongly influences the survival of viruses in the droplets. This project will address survivability of viruses inside droplets and its relationship to droplet size, type of surface and ambient conditions representing seasonal variations. The team will especially seek to understand conditions under which virus survival in surface-adherent droplets is diminished. This information is crucial for public health officials, virologists, and other experts working on disinfection efforts to control and mitigate current and future COVID-19 outbreaks.<br/><br/>This project will bring together an interdisciplinary team of engineers, virologists, and infectious disease experts to understand the mechanisms that determine virus survival/annihilation on different surfaces under varying seasonal conditions. The research plan combines computer simulations and experiments to reveal what happens inside droplets under conditions specific to COVID-19 scenarios. More specifically, this project will study the thermal and mass transport processes that occur in droplets drying on various surfaces. Project results will include quantitative information on the solute (salt, protein) concentration-time pathways in the interior of virus-carrying droplets drying on surfaces. These pathways will be quantified as functions of droplet size, composition, ambient temperature and relative humidity, and surface characteristics. Novel laser and chemical treatments of surfaces will be employed to modify hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity over a wide range to examine the effect of such modifications on droplet drying processes. This project will therefore reveal what types of seasonal conditions and surface modifications will contribute to diminished survival of viruses within droplets. The project team will transition project results to experts who study methods to deactivate viruses. Arming them with precise knowledge on the thermochemical conditions faced by the pathogens within drying droplets will enable them to focus attention on effective disinfection techniques.<br/><br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Thermal Transport Processes program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

761	John Yin	University of Wisconsin-Madison	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Ecological Dynamics of Human Coronavirus	Biological Sciences - With the zoonotic spillover of coronavirus into humans and the rapid emergence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), humanity faces its first global pandemic in more than a century. Current molecular, cellular and animal studies of the infectious agent, SARS-CoV-2, use purified virus stocks that ignore a more likely scenario which is that the natural infection spreads as a mixture of active and defective virus strains. This project is developing mathematical models and wet-lab experiments on human coronaviruses that highlight how ecological interactions between such strains and their host cells critically impact the dynamics of virus growth, spread and ultimately their ability to cause disease. The developed models account for the presence of defective virus strains. The broader impact of the results of this project would guide clinical and front-line researchers with direct access to patients, in exploring broader and deeper measures of the infection dynamics and in applying novel therapies. The project has potential to significantly impact the development of strategies that mitigate the pandemic. <br/><br/>This project develops mathematical models and performs wet-lab experiments on human coronaviruses. The outcome will highlight how ecological interactions between strains and their host cells could critically impact the dynamics of virus growth, spread and ultimately their ability to cause disease. The project goals are to: (i) extract essential mechanisms and parameters of coronavirus intracellular growth from the literature, (ii) build mathematical models that account for the kinetics of viral entry, gene expression, genome replication and particle assembly in the absence and presence of defective interfering (DI) particles, and (iii) implement wet-lab experiments to demonstrate the emergence of DI particles from coronavirus cultures, activation immune cytokine signaling, and validate the intracellular kinetic models.

However, like many viruses that cause serious morbidity and mortality, coronaviruses can mutate and develop drug resistance. Effective treatment may require the availability of multiple effective drugs. Thousands of drug candidates are available, but a current bottleneck is drug testing, which entails virus growth in cell cultures, a labor intensive, low sensitivity, and time-consuming process that can take up to a week to perform. ThIs EAGER project exploits microscopic fluid flows in cell and virus cultures to enhance sensitivity and speed, potentially reducing test times to one day. The project aims to identify best conditions for testing of drugs against the COVID-19 virus, which will expand opportunities to effectively treat infected patients.<br/><br/>The gold standard for testing anti-viral drugs is the plaque assay, which gives direct measures of drug effect on the production and spread of infectious virus particles in the cell culture. However, the plaque assay is labor-intensive, limited in sensitivity for drug testing, and it can take a week to perform. As an alternative, a team with expertise in virology and fluid dynamics will advance a faster, more sensitive assay. The approach exploits flow-enhanced infection spread and automated quantitative imaging, which they will optimize for coronavirus drug testing. The technology exploits microscale flows that sweep across infected cells, enhancing the spread of infection; in cell-culture wells, radial flows spontaneously arise from enhanced evaporative cooling at the fluid surface near the center of the each well, driving natural convection. The project may enable a 10-to100-fold higher sensitivity in one-tenth the time for testing drug candidates against COVID-19. Such accelerated testing could help efficiently identify drugs that significantly reduce morbidity and mortality from the ongoing pandemic and its possible re-emergence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

763	Danmeng Shuai	George Washington University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Collaborative Research: Electrospun Nanofibrous Air Filters for Coronavirus Control	Engineering - A collaborative team consisting of researchers from The George Washington University and the University of California, Riverside is developing electrospun nanofibrous air filters for controlling the transmission of coronavirus, including SARS-CoV-2. The pandemic of COVID-19 has raised a significant public health concern in 2020. The spread of COVID-19 is difficult to control, because SARS-CoV-2 is environmentally persistent and it can potentially be suspended in aerosols for long-range, airborne transmission and infection. Air filtration is crucial to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission, however most air filters used in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings are not effective for retaining viruses. As personal protective equipment for healthcare personnel or even the general public, respirators and masks that can effectively capture the virus are also urgently needed for this pandemic. Electrospinning has emerged as a novel technology to synthesize non-woven nanofibrous mats, and it is both industrially viable for large-scale manufacturing and deployable onsite for small-scale applications by a portable device. The fabricated nanofibrous mats are ideal for air filtration, because they have a reduced pore size to efficiently capture the virus, a large porosity to reduce air pressure drop in filtration, well-controlled properties, and mechanical robustness and flexibility. This RAPID research project will rationally design and fabricate novel nanomaterial-based air filters for coronavirus control, understand the interplay between viral pathogens and nanomaterials in complex environmental matrices, and initiate a fast response for protecting the public health with engineering tools. The project will provide training to students in science and engineering areas and offer them hands-on research experience, and introduce students from diverse backgrounds and educational levels, particularly those from underrepresented groups, to cutting-edge research in STEM. In addition, the project will disseminate the acquired knowledge through education modules, scientific journals and conferences, and science fairs, which will help increase the scientific literacy of the general public.<br/><br/>The research team aims to rationally design and fabricate electrospun nanofibrous air filters that are effective, low-cost, scalable, and easy for implementation for coronavirus control, including SARS-CoV-2, and to understand the mechanism of coronavirus removal in air filtration. The researchers will first develop electrospun nanofibrous air filters with diverse morphologies, retained charges, and selective binding sites to enhance the capture of bioaerosols containing coronavirus. Coronavirus removal efficiency under different environmental conditions will next be evaluated to understand the performance and robustness of the air filters. Key virus-nanomaterial interactions will be identified with the aid of both simulation and experimental tools, which can guide future air filter design and optimization. For this RAPID project, the researchers will also test the performance of air filters for removing SARS-CoV-2 in a healthcare facility that houses COVID-19 patients. The proposed research will contribute significantly to nanotechnology, microbiology, and environmental engineering, and it can be potentially transformative in the field of materials at large in terms of multiscale, rational, functional design. It will not only provide a rapid response to COVID-19 outbreaks and public health protection, but also be translated into controlling other virulent pathogens. The project will provide training to students in STEM, particularly introduce students from underrepresented groups and students from diverse backgrounds and educational levels to cutting-edge research. Moreover, the project will disseminate the acquired knowledge to help increase the scientific literacy of the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

764	Ashutosh Chilkoti	Duke University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Combined Antigen and Serology Rapid Test for COVID-19	Engineering - COVID-19 outbreak is currently a pandemic disease and public health emergency in many countries. Population-wide testing is critical for controlling the outbreak and periodic retesting will be important to prevent future spikes in transmission. The research team of Prof. Chilkoti at Duke University aims to develop a rapid and sensitive test that detects coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) for infection diagnosis and patient-derived antibodies for immunity assessment. The benefit of this combined format is that if the test results are negative for SARS-CoV-2 on symptomatic patients, serology results will indicate if a previous infection existed. For asymptomatic patients, hidden active infections can also be detected. The sensing method is designed to enable sample handling and testing to be easily performed by personnel who have minimal medical training. This project on developing a simple to use and widely deployable biosensor provides research training opportunities to graduate students and helps to prepare a skilled workforce for the biosensing and biomedical engineering fields.<br/><br/>The multiplex point-of-care test is designed for detecting the viral nucleocapsid protein (N) from nasal swabs and patient-derived antibodies against the viral S1 spike protein (S1) from a few drops of blood. It uses a single, standardized microfluidic chip that allows testing of both swab buffers and whole blood. Upon addition of a patient's samples, the assay automatically advances to completion without user intervention. It employs a highly sensitive and inexpensive handheld detector, the D4Scope, that does not require an external power source or laboratory infrastructure. The results can be wirelessly transmitted to a remote server.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

765	Rastislav Bodik	University of Washington	None	2020-05-01	2020-10-31	RAPID: Collecting Reliable COVID-19 Datasets in Crisis Conditions	Office of the Director - This RAPID project enables approaches to mitigate the negative impacts of COVID-19 on public health, society, and the economy by deploying technologies to enable collecting reliable COVID-19-related data sets under crisis conditions. <br/><br/>In the midst of a crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, generators of critical new data, such as hospitals and critical health organizations, lack the time and resources to make this important data readily available for use by others. One cannot expect the already overburdened primary data providers to do the extra work needed to make the data more accessible for others to use. Even those who already publish data on their websites often do not have the time to edit/modify the data, for example to apply newly introduced tags, such as Schema.org?s new tags related to coronavirus. Yet, these data are critical in a crisis in order to inform the public; improve emergency response; and aid the scientific community in its efforts to find solutions. Currently, the teams that are engaged in dataset collection are employing slow, tedious, and painstaking manual techniques. The interactive dataset collection tools to be developed by this project will provide an alternative approach, empowering a community of volunteers to help with data collection efforts. The data collection tools developed can be used with only an internet connection, a web browser, and brief training, thereby putting the effort well within reach of a large population of potential volunteers. <br/><br/>Existing automatic data extractors assume that (i) webpages in a single website are structured uniformly, because they were produced from the same template and (ii) relevant webpages originate from a single website. As a result, much of the prior work in the area of web data extraction and ingestion focuses on ?syntactic? extraction. Currently, dedicated data collection teams are collecting data with a combination of expertise and time-consuming and painstaking manual effort. Other teams are hiring call centers to call hospitals in each state to collect their capacities. Such high-cost, high-effort approaches do not scale well to all the datasets that one would like to be able to access and analyze. Many COVID-19-related datasets are scattered over thousands of websites with similar information but no structural similarities--e.g., each hospital?s website may look different but may contain very similar and related data. The technical challenge that this project will tackle will be to build a ?semantic? data extractor that locates the information of interest despite divergent website structures. The software tools that will be created for data ingestion can be used by the many individuals who are keen to contribute their time and effort to help combat COVID-19, without compromising their physical distancing efforts.<br/><br/>This RAPID award is made by the Convergence Accelerator program in the Office of Integrative Activities and is associated with the Convergence Accelerator Track A: Open Knowledge Network.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

One of the methods to detect COVID-19 infection, track the treatment effectiveness, and validate successful vaccination, is to measure the antibodies developed in human bodies. Unfortunately, current antibody detection relies on either complicated instruments in a centralized lab which is expensive and takes a long time to get the results, or a paper-based test strip, which, while quick (5-20 minutes), produces only Yes/No results, making this method very easy to generate false positives/negative and impossible to track the patients? response to infection, treatment, and vaccination. Therefore, a portable device that can rapidly, sensitively, and accurately measure multiple COVID-19 related antibodies is urgently needed to diagnose early infection and monitoring patients? response. The device in the project is based on a portable microfluidic system to rapidly, accurately, and sensitively measure the antibodies in blood at point-of-care, which allows for the detection of COVID-19 infection and tracking of antibody development in human bodies.<br/><br/>The objective of the project is to combine microfluidic laser technology and microfluidic ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) technology to develop rapid and highly sensitive sensor array for multiplexed detection of COVID-19 related IgG and IgM using fingertip blood. There are three tasks: (1) to develop a microfluidic chip to extract serum from whole blood; (2) to integrate the laser sensing technology with traditional fluorescence ELISA to sensitively detect antibodies (IgG and IgM) with a large dynamic range; (3) to test with artificially spiked samples. The device provides the following advantages. (1) Quick turn-around time. It is highly portable and can be used to rapidly screen patients on-site, rather than sending samples to centralized labs. (2) Highly quantitative. This is critical to significantly reducing the false positives/negatives and monitoring the patients? infection trajectories and response to treatment and vaccination. (3) Highly sensitive and large dynamic range. Combined with the lasing technology, we expect to improve the antibody detection limit 10X with 10X larger dynamic range. Higher sensitivity enables earlier diagnosis of infection, preventing wide disease spread from those asymptomatic patients. A large dynamic range enables to easily track patients? antibody evolution over time. (4) Highly versatile. The device can be adapted to rapidly detect cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which is one of the death causes in COVID-19 patients.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

The project will develop software tools to help in the creation of "auxiliary" databases with high-quality data to assist in making better decisions, avoiding fraud, and yielding high-quality analysis sooner in the urgent and rapidly evolving situation created by the coronavirus pandemic. The techniques that will be used to achieve high-quality include:<br/><br/>(1) linking "background data" to the data sets to enable quality-checking and fraud detection. For example, ensuring that hospital information listed in the medical resource database is annotated with an accurate phone number so that a volunteer can contact the hospital and check on the accuracy of the data, and <br/><br/>(2) creating new "join keys" to enable easy integration of data in the auxiliary database with other data. The project will work closely with other related COVID-19 RAPID efforts which are working on various aspects of data and information collection from the Web.<br/><br/>The project will focus on creating two high-quality databases using these strategies: <br/><br/>(1) A unified medical institution auxiliary database, which will be a database of all known US medical institutions and <br/>(2) A unified government office auxiliary database, which will be a database of all known government offices in the United States?city halls, courts, licensing offices, etc.?at any level of government. <br/><br/>Both these data sets are crucial for ensuring that citizens receive a base level of medical aid and government assistance. These resources would be beneficial not only for this particular pandemic, but would become essential resources, in general, for the future. <br/><br/>The proposed auxiliary data set creation infrastructure will include a rich schema of background information, used for quality-checking, and a set of join keys for data integration. While there is a huge array of medical institution data sets online, many of the data sets are misaligned due to lack of standard names and/or data integration keys since different projects make different local decisions in choosing these values that may not be universally compatible. As a result, the background information becomes less rich and makes integration with data from other institutions or analysis pipelines much more difficult. The strategies used to create this infrastructure would include: <br/><br/>(1) synthesis of preliminary auxiliary datasets, which includes generating common, candidate attributes for all objects in the input set, for example, creating a helipad field for hospitals based on examining all hospital data in Wikidata; <br/>(2) identification of inputs with missing values, and filling in those values with a combination of Web extraction tasks and crowdsourcing tasks, and <br/>(3) flagging values that are suspected of being incorrect by, for example, automatically creating a set of machine-learned predictors for each column in the auxiliary data. The system could then run the predictor and identify outlier values.<br/><br/>This RAPID award is made by the Convergence Accelerator program in the Office of Integrative Activities using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, and is associated with the Convergence Accelerator Track A: Open Knowledge Network.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

While this transition has not been easy for any instructor, the shift to online learning has been especially difficult for students in STEM courses, particularly engineering, which has a strong practical/laboratory component. This project investigates how the pandemic is impacting students historically underrepresented in engineering. There is an urgency to collect this data in the midst of the crisis. Through the use of an online data collection platform, SenseMaker, short stories will be collected from underrepresented engineering students to describe how they are experiencing the COVID-19 crisis during the transition to online learning. These stories will be used to help provide institutions with tools necessary to ensure minority students are not left out of decisions made with the majority in mind. This RAPID project will adopt the SenseMaker approach to investigate how underrepresented college students cope in times of crisis. This study builds on a previous investigation of community experiences in a crisis context; namely the SenseMaker approach was used to investigate how stakeholder groups in Puerto Rico adapted in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria (NSF #1832678).<br/><br/>The overarching research question that guides this project is: How has the abrupt transition to online instruction due to COVID-19 affected students historically underrepresented in engineering? More specifically, the investigators are interested in understanding how the transition has impacted underrepresented students based on the following factors: 1) year in school (underclassmen vs. upperclassmen); 2) Predominately White Institution attendance vs Minority Serving Institution attendance; 3) socioeconomic status; and, 4) geographical location. This RAPID project will collect data until December 2020. The approach is to continuously collect micro-narratives of participants? experiences (qualitative data) and responses to a survey questions that prompt participants to make sense of their experiences (quantitative data). These data will be analyzed for patterns to inform actions to improve the experiences of underrepresented engineering students. These data will inform future work that will focus on the development of empirically informed policies to aid institutions as we continue to navigate this current pandemic and reduce the disruption of such transitions in the future. Additionally, an outcome of conducting this research is to inform institutions of challenges faced by this particular population to highlight that diversity and inclusion efforts must be attended to in virtual learning environments and activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Demography, population density, business structure, and social culture differ across regions. Correlating these local factors with the number of infections and the availability of hospital resources can provide precious scientific and data-driven guidance to local policy makers. Different from existing, classic epidemic models, in this project we aim to build novel forecasting models based on cutting-edge AI techniques. The goal is to provide timely, localized information needed by administrators for strategic allocation of resources and planning towards reopening business. One key advantage of our approach is that it is able to combine the data from regions with more COVID-19 cases with the US Census microdata that characterize each local community, hence helping us to make fine-grained predictions of the localized effects of a policy decision.<br/><br/>Existing simulation models for COVID-19 cases forecasting either ignore the fine-grained demographical, social and cultural difference at local communities, or often require complicated, manual parameter setting for estimating the effect of interventions. Existing statistical models, on the other hand, require substantial amount of data to be available, hence are not able to obtain sufficiently confident predictions on each local level. We propose a fundamentally different approach that is built on the newest neural network models like Transformers to overcome these weaknesses. The proposed approach performs domain adaption and few shot learning, so that knowledge learned from other regions can be adapted to local communities even when only a few data points are available. Specifically, our approach will creatively draw information from the US Census?s American Community Survey data, COVID-19 related data from other regions at home and abroad, as well as other related kinds of epidemics under the clinical guidance of our collaborators from the Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

The principal investigator aims to develop a topical method that will enhance protection against virus attachment onto the nasal and oral as well as conjunctival epithelial cells, while preserving normal physiology and biochemistry. The project team will use computer models to engineer delivery devices to produce the optimal particle characteristics to maximally prevent microbial infection. If successful, this project can lead to paradigm changing alternatives to reducing public health risk to air borne infections like COVID-19 and seasonal flu which may be associated with devastating effects on the United States and World economy. The proposed approach will be swiftly conducted to present realistic solutions that may be useable in the face of this COVID-19 pandemic as well as future flu viruses of similar magnitude.<br/><br/>This research will fundamentally contribute to modeling the interactions between viral membranes and nanoscale barriers. The production of an innovative nanoscale biodegradable barrier may reduce the socioeconomic and public health burden significantly by lowering the risk of viral infection during the flu season or pandemics. The project team comprise of an interdisciplinary team that include engineers, ophthalmologists, molecular biologist, virologist and pharmacologist to explore a problem that could have a tremendous impact on the way we respond to seasonal flu or pandemics. Besides the potential benefits to reduce COVID-19 and influenza related deaths in the US and worldwide, the proposed work will afford us the opportunity to train engineering and biomedical students in a highly interdisciplinary research activity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

771	Zheng O'Neill	Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Smart Ventilation Control May Reduce Infection Risk for COVID-19 in Public Buildings	Engineering - During the current COVID-19 pandemic, airborne transmission of the virus through exhaled aerosols is a likely explanation for the rapid rate of new infections. The risk of infection with COVID-19 could be reduced by employing feasible measures in public buildings, such as smart and enhanced Heating, Ventilation, and Air- conditioning (HVAC) design and operations, higher humidity levels, surface cleaning and hygiene protocols, revised spatial configuration, etc. This project aims to investigate a novel smart ventilation control strategy using a CO2-based indicator to operate under a normal mode and a pandemic mode as appropriate for common public buildings (e.g., office buildings, classroom buildings, retail stores). These buildings are designed and operated in normal conditions by default. The question to be studied is that, with the current HVAC equipment and systems already installed in existing public buildings, can operations be modified via smart ventilation control by diluting the air in a space with cleaner air from outdoors to reduce infection risk for occupants. <br/><br/>Ventilation controls in public buildings under a pandemic represent significant challenges. In this project, the research team will look into the problem of potentially reducing infection risk with coronavirus through three objectives: 1) Obtain a minimum ventilation rate for different HVAC systems in most common public buildings to potentially reduce infection risk through a risk analysis with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations; 2) Establish a scientific correlation between CO2 concentration with the potential infection risk in spaces in public buildings to better monitor the infection risk with numerical studies and limited field experiments; and 3) Evaluate a novel smart ventilation control strategy that can switch between normal operation and operation under a pandemic through a co-simulation of energy performance and CFD simulations. COVID-19 has generated immense social-economic impact, which may be mitigated by the proposed smart ventilation control in public buildings to reduce the risk of being infected with COVID-19 during occupation of public buildings<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Yet humans alone cannot grasp the vast data generated by social media, so computers are used to assist. Very little is currently known about how to leverage the skills of humans and machines when they work together (human-machine teaming) to identify meaningful patterns in social media data. Therefore, the fundamental issues this Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project seeks to address are 1) understanding the process of real-time decisions that human digital volunteers make when they rapidly convert social media data into structured codes the machine (Artificial Intelligence algorithms) can understand, and 2) using this knowledge to improve human-machine teaming. This project advances the field by revealing the unique abilities that both humans and machines bring when working together to comprehend social media patterns during an evolving disaster. It supports education and diversity by providing research experiences to diverse students, as well as generating data useful for interdisciplinary courses teaching teamwork, social media analysis, and human-machine teaming. Finally, the findings can help emergency managers better train their volunteers who comb through social media using their understanding of the local knowledge and built environment to help machines see new patterns in data. Hence, this project supports NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance the nation's health, prosperity, and welfare by articulating the unique value that both humans and computers bring that can lead to better decisions during disasters. The goal of this research is to better understand the real-time decisions that human annotators make under different environmental constraints, and how those contribute to the learning of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. Under time constraints and information overload, human decision-making capabilities are limited; yet, humans still have a unique ability to understand the contextual references to the structures in the built environment that machines cannot recognize. For example, the meaning of the tweet, ?Memorial is overloaded,? -- which means the hospital, called Memorial, is out of beds for patients ?- can be lost on AI systems that lack the knowledge of the built environment. This example demonstrates the value that humans in the loop offer in a human-AI teaming context. <br/><br/>This research focuses on capturing the ephemeral data from a variety of social media sources and our two research thrusts include: 1) online observations of Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) volunteers and a manager (a collaborator on this project) using think-aloud and cognitive interviewing strategies to reveal the real-time mental models used to make coding decisions for annotation tasks; and 2) an empirical analysis of different sampling algorithms for active (machine) learning paradigms to develop a typology of machine errors under diverse contexts that affect the quality of human decision making for annotation. This research will generate design guidelines that bridge the gap between the mechanisms used for real-time data processing with AI models and the understanding of context contributed by a human user teaming with the AI models. Using theories of human decision-making combined with knowledge of how AI functions, this project provides a real-time, mid-disaster examination of 1) how humans understand, process, and interpret social media messages, and 2) how to refine AI algorithms to optimize active learning paradigm. This understanding will provide a theoretical framework enabling future research to develop protocols to optimize human-AI teaming by using concepts such as motivation and information theory. This work can help emergency managers conduct better training of their CERT volunteers and other annotators and provide clearer guidelines for how to communicate the unique value that humans bring to the annotation process for AI systems. Both our protocols and developed understanding of how humans interact with AI systems will be helpful for global health organizations, local and state-level disaster decision-makers, as well as provide direction for the vast CERT network in the United States.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

The model focuses on compliance with mitigation strategies and public health guidelines, thus enabling the selection of policies that are most effective in promoting both the progress of science and advancing national health and prosperity. Various pandemic models are currently being used to predict the spread of a virus and establish which mitigation strategies are the most effective. These models are heavily based on assumptions and may include an oversimplified reality of how populations react and behave. This research will provide needed knowledge and methods for the development of a model of how individuals in the U.S. react to certain mitigation strategies, such as social-distancing, stay-at-home orders, quarantines, and travel advisories, by mining and analyzing social media data during the COVID-19 crisis. This enhanced modeling approach and its resultant model will be of great value to disaster response managers and policy/decision makers to understand human social behavior. This work allows assessment of the effectiveness of mitigation strategies and public health guidelines during pandemics (and other crises). This project will also form the basis of a publicly available case study suitable for university level students that can be widely incorporated in courses. <br/><br/>Although individual-based and homogeneous mixing pandemic models provide useful insights and predictive capabilities within a range of possibilities, they are highly sensitive to people?s actions. This research aims to provide an enhanced approach to model social behavior and community activity during a pandemic in terms of compliance with mitigation strategies and public health guidelines. Social media data present a brief window of opportunity for research on how, and to what extent, the public does or does not comply with the recommended mitigation strategies and public health guidelines. The research team will collect real-time data from social media related to COVID19-exposed regional populations in the U.S. The data will be analyzed using machine learning techniques to identify non-mutually exclusive clusters of people based on similarity of their demographic, geographic, and time information, and establish relationships among clusters. The analyzed data will form the basis of a data-driven multi-paradigm simulation model that captures changes in public sentiment over time, quantifies the resistance/compliance with mitigation strategies and health guidelines, and gauges overall effectiveness of various mitigation strategies and advice over time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

It is equally important for social scientists to understand how the threat of coronavirus infection affects human behavior, so that public health strategies to predict and contain the spread can be improved. The COVID-19 threat has been eliciting dramatically varying psychological and behavioral responses throughout the country. Some people comply with medical experts? protective action recommendations (PARs) to limit their exposure through actions such as social distancing (maintaining a six-foot distance), others exceed those PARs by self-imposing more extreme isolation, and still others disregard PARs, continuing their normal activities or congregating in close proximity without respiratory protection. The objective of this Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project is to identify determinants of varying behavioral responses to COVID-19 threat, including compliance with official PARs (e.g., social distancing, frequent hand washing) and stockpiling of household supplies (e.g., nonperishable food, cleaning supplies). With a better understanding of the determinants of COVID PAR compliance and stockpiling, public health authorities can develop more effective messages to help reduce the threat of COVID and other pandemic diseases. In addition, for factors that public health authorities cannot change (e.g., people?s demographic characteristics), the project will examine audience segmentation strategies that can be used to guide the tailoring of communication to specific population groups.<br/><br/>This research project builds on data gathered during a 2019 survey of Portland (Oregon) Metro area residents? seismic preparedness intentions and actual preparedness in anticipation of a future earthquake, as well as on a 2020 survey of Boise State University students, staff, and faculty emergency preparedness and response for a variety of hazards, including COVID. It also builds upon a set of 2013 studies of risk perceptions and preparedness related to H7N9 influenza in China and seasonal influenza in Texas. This new project will involve a mail survey of 1000 Portland Metro area regarding their perceptions of, and responses to, the COVID threat. The questionnaire will repeat some of the same items about seismic emergency preparedness as in the 2019 survey, adding new items specific to COVID and to household stockpiling in the face of the pandemic. Also as part of this project, Boise State students, faculty, and staff will be surveyed with a number of the new, COVID-specific survey items. With the new survey data, the research team will be able to draw meaningful conclusions about how perceptions and preparedness behaviors vary across different types of anticipated disasters and across disease threats with different profiles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Due to the current complexity of the tests and thus capacity limits, testing is typically limited to those meeting certain threshold criteria. In addition, test results may take up to 48 hours to be returned to parts of New Zealand by the time samples reach the lab, the work is completed, and the results returned. Therefore, the danger exists that a disease will spread faster than the testing can help isolate positive cases. This work aims to develop rapid (15minute) molecular diagnostics that can be performed anywhere without the need for DNA instrumentation. Results will be collected and reported centrally via a smart phone app for further follow-up and confirmation. Such a method will be amenable to any new virus to ensure rapid and consistent diagnostics can be performed anywhere in New Zealand within a short time-frame.

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project. During public health emergencies policymakers are under incredible pressures from many sides, including the media, public, healthcare workers, and politicians. The decisions made have wide impacts on many sectors of society, especially healthcare workers at the front line of the outbreak response. This proposal responds to the theme of “understanding and influencing behaviour of institutions and individuals.” We aim to understand better how UK policymakers arrive at decisions during the Covid-19 outbreak, and the impact of those decisions on UK healthcare workers. Making sense of policy decisions usually occurs after an outbreak, and thus can only impact on future events. Here we propose a novel prospective evaluation, monitoring conventional and social media data, and gathering information from key policy stakeholders (e.g. Jeremy Farrar and David Heymann) about their activities, and the drivers of policy choices (Work Package 1). In parallel we will purposively select key informants from primary care and hospital settings to gain insight into healthworker concerns and perceptions regarding the response to Covid-19, including views on service level adaptations following policy changes (Work Package 2). This work requires rapid activation to capture timely, valid information about attitudes during the outbreak, and deliver prompt results to policymakers. We are already piloting the research, with pump-prime funding from the NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Emerging and Zoonotic Infections, and will scale it with MRC support. Our team has extensive experience evaluating the impacts of policy in healthcare systems in the UK and internationally, leading to change in practice.	Medical Research Council	P&Cs	294488.0 GBP

During public health emergencies policymakers are under incredible pressures from many sides, including the media, public, healthcare workers, and politicians.

A Public Health Emergency was declared for COVID-19 to galvanize global collaboration to support less resources nations; this must include research to address the unknowns and ensure equity in who benefits from findings and interventions. We propose to further develop a proven mechanism for supporting locally-led evidence generation by facilitating knowledge sharing between all the networks and getting information and support to where research capacity is low. During the Ebola and Zika outbreak The Global Health Network served an important role in delivering and sharing trusted research tools, guidance and training which facilitated faster, standardised quality data capture. Beyond these outbreaks we have been working with our partners to create lasting research networks to support evidence generation in challenging settings. Here we will take our experience and add new innovative technology to make highly targeted information, tools and resources discoverable and support rapid implementation of new knowledge as this outbreak evolves. Our global partners are asking for such a mechanism, and here we can use the platform, our community, technolology and expertise to address the immediate need for global sharing and research support at this crucial point. What we learn here can then be applied to future outbreaks.	Medical Research Council	P&Cs	299860.0 GBP

Customisation of FFP3 standard facemasks, whether generic or those being developed through alternative manufacturing routes to address the global supply shortage, is urgently required to (i) provide an effective seal protecting workers against viral transmission and (ii) enhance wearability to prevent skin trauma that is associated with prolonged use. In this project we will firstly assess the suitability of using smart phone based 3D imaging technologies to capture facial form and compare this data with clinically used photogrammetry. Simultaneously we will develop and assess a range of custom silicone interface prototypes that can be applied to existing FFP3 masks and newly developed designs. To achieve this we will use our existing expertise of 3D printing silicone to systematically optimise compositions tailored for this application exploring rheological and deposition variables. Our aim is to rapidly progress to mask 'fit' checking according to standard clinical procedures, evaluating for superiority in seal, comfort and reduced fitting time. Efficacy of viral disinfection of the additively manufactured silicone interfaces will also be assessed to facilitate translation. End-users will take an active part in the project, which itself will be supported by institutional research and development / commercialisation teams to maximise the chance of scale-up at the earliest timepoint.

The proposed research program is broadly concerned with Chinese Canadians' experiences of discrimination and stigmatization in the current context of the COVID-19 epidemic. Central to these experiences, we suggest, is non-Chinese Canadians' understanding of risk and the cultural dimensions of preventative health practices. The research program has three interrelated components that, together, will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of how Chinese and non-Chinese Canadians understand, experience, and react to the COVID-19, and have implications for developing strategies to combat stigma and fear associated with Chinese people and COVID-19. The first study involves a longitudinal study of Chinese Canadians' experiences of discrimination during the COVID-19 epidemic will help determine what kinds of support Chinese Canadians would like to receive now and in the near future. The second study focuses on non-Chinese Canadians' perceptions of risk associated with virus transmission. This study will test the idea that one way to allay fears aroused by viral outbreaks is to provide people with accurate numerical information about the mortality rate produced by the virus, and its main implication that reducing fear may decrease discrimination against Chinese Canadians. Risk perceptions also predict preventative behaviour. Thus, the third study focuses on wearing a face mask in public as a preventative health practice that is particularly enmeshed in cultural beliefs that differ across the two communities Together, these three interrelated components represent significant social countermeasure research to combat the intergroup threat driven by misinformation, stigma, and cultural misunderstanding associated with COVID-19.

People who travel back to their countries of origin to visit friends and relatives (VFR) (including the children of immigrants and international students) are often at a higher risk of getting the disease and then spreading it to others. A better understanding of VFR traveler knowledge, risk perceptions, information needs, barriers to pre-travel care and advice, and access to protective measures will help us better develop strategies to keep travelers healthy. This will prevent the spread of COVID- 19 and its potential negative consequences. Our research will take place in the Fraser Valley and lower mainland of British Columbia as an area with a high number of immigrants. We are seeking information from Chinese and Punjabi VFR travelers, international students at the University of the Fraser Valley, and family physicians. We will use a combination of focus groups, surveys and interviews to get this information. The researchers for this study have a lot of experience in working with immigrant populations on infectious diseases to determine their risk communication needs. This includes research with VFR travelers. The University of the Fraser Valley has partnerships with organizations (such as the Divisions of Family Practice and Community Services) that enable us to easily access research participants. They will also help us access their large and diverse international student body. Including researchers from other countries, like Australia and New Zealand, will help us make sure our research and recommendations can be part of a coordinated international response.

We will undertake this research with a view to meeting two objectives. First, we seek to investigate how the pre and in-crisis trust context has shaped the response to COVID-19 in China and Canada (Objective 1). Second, we seek to understand how the COVID-19 outbreak response and experience then shaped the post-crisis context of trust in in China and Canada (Objective 2). The inclusion of both countries is vital not only for the possible control that Canada provides to the Chinese case, but also because it will allow for a more global picture of the impacts that the crisis had on individuals who are ethnically Chinese living outside of China. We will make these contributions by analyzing existing trust data collected prior to the outbreak (pre-crisis); by adding questions about the outbreak to current surveys being conducted on trust in China by team members (in-crisis rapid response conducted immediately); by conducting a new rapidly developed online survey to be administered in China and Canada (in-crisis rapid response conducted immediately; repeated post crisis), and by conducting focus groups with citizens in Chinese and Canadian cities (in crisis Canada only rapid response; repeated post crisis both countries). We anticipate that our team, which brings together experts in trust and health from the center of the outbreak in China, including in Wuhan city, as well as leading scholars on trust and public health in Canada and Sweden, is ideally positioned to conduct this research. As a result of team members' ongoing and previous collaborations we are well-poised for the rapid engagement that is urgently needed in order to meet the global challenge posed by the COVID-19 outbreak.

An innovative device to manage patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. COVID study (Closed-Loop Oxygen to Verify that healthcare workers Interventions Decrease during pneumonia)	Automated oxygen titration, weaning and monitoring (FreeO2 device) may be a solution to reduce the number of interventions of healthcare workers (which is directly related to the risk of transmission of COVID-19. There is a high risk of transmission of COVID-19 to healthcare workers. in a recent cohort, 29% of the patients hospitalized were healthcare workers. Among the main WHO's strategic objectives for the response to COVID-19, the first was to limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers. Every measures that potentially reduce the number of interventions during the management of patients infected by COVID-19 should be evaluated. Oxygen therapy is the first line respiratory support in all patients hospitalized for COVID-19 during initial management. Recent recommendations are to accurately titrate oxygen to avoid hypoxemia and complications-related to hyperoxia (local and systemic inflammation, vasoconstriction through reactive oxygen species production, acute myocardial infarction). In addition, around 1/3 of the patients will deteriorate their clinical condition and require admission to intensive care units; consequently, a close monitoring is required during initial management. We will conduct a randomized controlled study comparing Automated oxygen titration and monitoring (FreeO2) vs. Manual oxygen titration and weaning in patients hospitalized for infectious pneumonia requiring oxygen therapy. The patients will be included in Canadian sites within the first 3 days of admission and will be evaluated during 24 consecutive hours, including 4 hours at bedside. Two hundreds and sixteen patients will be included in the study. The primary endpoint will be the number of interventions for oxygen management Secondary endpoints will include the oxygenation parameters and the oxygen consumption.

However, China has been particularly hit with over 70 000 confirmed cases, of which about 80% are in Hubei province. Wuhan, capital city of Hubei, is considered ground zero of the outbreak. Testing is typically performed at centralized facilities with highly qualified personnel operating specialized equipment, RT-qPCR being the current method of choice and DNA sequencing a second choice. The response time between sampling patients and obtaining clinically relevant information usually depends on sample shipping time and clinical lab capacity. In this current outbreak containment situation in China, large portions of the population are quarantined, travel is restricted, and clinical labs are operating well over capacity. We propose to develop a rapid point-of-care test to help mitigate the outbreak of COVID-19. The RNA-based test will be performed with a high sensitivity, label-free sensing method. RNA purification and amplification will not be required. The instrumentation needed will be portable and lightweight to enable frontline workers to rapidly test for SARS-CoV-2. The assay will be developed with an easy-to-use platform that can be operated by untrained personnel. It can thereby be deployed locally, within regions of quarantine at a temporary health centers and neighbourhood clinics, reducing flow of people in urban centers; it can be shipped and used in remote or isolated areas including cruise ships	Canadian Institutes of Health Research	Research Grant	1000000.0 CAD

At University Health Network, our team represents a deeply experienced group of critical care doctors and infectious disease researchers who can immediately respond to the global need to provide an accurate diagnosis of respiratory illness-the main feature of COVID-19-at the front lines of patient care. We have recently developed a 40 minute diagnostic test to determine lung quality for transplantation. Recent scientific studies from China clearly show that the body's development of respiratory distress as a response to potential COVID-19 infection produces an identical injury profile that would be detected by our diagnostic test. We will work alongside SQI Diagnostics, our Canadian partner committed to developing diagnostics for lung health, to adapt our test towards the development of RALI-Dx (Rapid Acute Lung Injury Diagnostic). This diagnostic can be used by hospital emergency departments to screen for lung sickness and the likelihood of COVID-19 infection. An important part of our CIHR-supported research study is a commitment from our Chinese collaborators to safely test our diagnostic first on COVID-19+ blood samples to make sure the test is highly accurate before hospital use. With our 40 minute RALI-Dx test, we will: -Quickly identify the highest risk patients in need of immediate care -Identify lower risk patients who require at-home monitoring -Reduce the current major stress on health care facilities Additionally, new COVID-19 therapies are being rapidly developed around the world, and the first step will be to identify which patients will benefit the most from these treatments.

The recent outbreak of the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic clearly demonstrates how in today's age infectious agents can spread rapidly. Given the ability of individuals to travel across the globe infectious agents can reach pandemic/epidemic proportions quickly, as seen with SARS and MERS outbreaks. Such viral agents become infectious because of genetic alterations many times occurring in other animals and eventually can infect humans. There are no effective anti-viral agents nor have vaccines been developed. Thus during these outbreaks we can only rely on infection control measures. Such measures help control the spread of the disease but is dependent on verifying individuals who are infected and those who are not infected. Presently diagnosing COVID-19 infections is inadequate as the laboratory tests may take 24-48 hrs to be completed. Such time periods make infection control very difficult. In this proposal we discuss how a rapid testing and diagnosis be made in the order of minutes. We have developed a revolutionary methodology that would construct a diagnostic device which is small and portable, and even be battery operated. Our device would be a true point of care platform that would be used at the "first contact" between patient and health professional. Our point of care testing platform would give rapid result in minutes and would help enormously in infection control management of not only the current COVID-19 outbreaks but also future pathogenic viral outbreaks which are surely to happen.

First, we do not know what the disease is yet; we are still learning a great deal about what it causes in humans. We do not know what treatments to give, what risk factors are present for severe disease, and how long people are sick. We are proposing a national observational study of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, with an embedded randomized clinical trial of an antiviral agent. The observational study will build on work that we have been doing for the past four years, with pre-established protocols and data collection infrastructure just for this purpose. The randomized clinical trial will be with global collaborators to make sure that Canadian patients inform the world, and vice versa, about how to best treat this new disease. Alongside this, we will conduct surveys of clinicians, researchers, and the public about how they understand this new outbreak, how they feel about participating in research during a major outbreak, and what should be done differently; all of which will inform our clinical studies. Finally, we have been asked by the WHO to conduct a formal guideline for the management of COVID-19, which we will perform as data begins to emerge from the clinical trials that are ongoing. All of these proposals, put together, create a suite of approaches to better understanding and managing a new infection.

The collaborative research is conducted by a multi-disciplinary team of virologists, chemists, infectious disease specialists, front-line practitioners, and public health researchers from the University of Alberta, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, and Wuhan Institute of Virology (China). The immediate priority focuses on developing two complementary techniques to be performed on-site and in resource-limited settings, in support of rapid diagnosis of COVID-19. The diagnostic innovation takes advantage of the most recent advances in chemistry, molecular biology, genome technology, and nanotechnology. Chemical reactions required for efficient amplification and sensitive detection of the viral RNA take place in a single tube at a moderate temperature, simplifying the operation procedures. The specific reaction products are visible to the naked eyes, thus eliminating the need for any elaborate equipment. The first test reads color changes, with red color indicating negative and blue color indicating positive. Readout for the second test is color band on paper strips, similar to those of pregnancy tests, with two red bands indicating positive whereas a single control band indicating negative. The mid-term priority focuses on validating and evaluating the new diagnostic tests for field applications in the epidemic center of COVID-19. Our team members in Wuhan who currently perform the standard diagnostic tests will lead this effort. Once validated and approved, the new diagnostic tools will be used to support screening and diagnosis of COVID-19 at the community level. The mid-term objective also includes adapting the point-of-care diagnostics at other collaborating sites, e.g., Karachi (Pakistan) and Nairobi (Kenya). A longer-term priority of this research includes refining the new diagnostic tools to enable monitoring of mutational changes of the virus as it continues to evolve.

The strategies need to be as vast as possible since we do not yet know if vaccines or other antiviral drugs will be efficacious. Our group had previously shown in the context of influenza infection that the human host has cell-surface proteases (called type II transmembrane serine proteases or TTSPs) that the virus requires in order to cleave a viral surface protein called hemagglutinin, itself essential for the virus to gain entry into the cell and further replicate using the host cell machinery. We had shown that small molecules inhibiting the activity of lung epithelial cell proteases were efficacious at significantly reducing influenza virulence demonstrating novel anti-viral properties of the compounds. The situation is similar with the SARS-CoV-2 virus but the protein found on the surface of the virus is different. This protein is called the spike glycoprotein (or S protein) and it requires cleavage by human host cell proteases of the TTSP family for its virulence. Our proposal will test protease inhibitors in models where cells are expressing the S protein and the most potent molecules will then be validated in lung organoids to verify their efficacy at reducing viral propagation. We have put together a team of molecular pharmacologists, chemists and virologist with access to containment level 3 facilities to rapidly assess the potential anti-viral properties of the compounds that we already have on hand. In addition, our team will be supported by Dr. Gary Whittaker, Cornell University, one of the world's experts in coronavirus biology. We believe that these conditions are very favorable for us to have a quick impact in the field and to deliver novel antiviral compounds for patients with COVID-19.

First, we will collect clinical and epidemiologic information about COVID-19 in Toronto and Peel region to share with ISARIC studies of the risk factors for, clinical features and outcomes of this infection in Canada and around the world. Second, we will collect data about how long patients with this infection shed virus, and whether this virus can be found on surfaces and in the air around patients with this infection, in order to help guide infection prevention practice. Third, we will systematically collect samples containing the virus, serum and cells of the immune system, in order to create a biobank that can be shared with investigators developing vaccines and treatment for this disease.

811	Gary P Kobinger	Université Laval	None	None	None	Development of vaccine candidates and monoclonal antibodies to interrupt the spread of the novel coronavirus, COVID- 19	The novel coronavirus (Covid19) that emerged in Wuhan, China is a threat to global health. Infection causes respiratory disease that can progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress and even death. Often patients require hospitalization and intensive care, which increases the chance of viral spread within health care settings. Since it was first identified there have been over 69000 cases, and 1600 deaths, and the virus has spread to multiple countries. Currently, there are no vaccines or therapeutics, but these are urgently needed to bring the epidemic under control. Our proposal seeks to address these areas of need by a multifaceted approach. Specifically, the objectives of this proposal include: 1) Isolation of virus and generation of an in vitro reverse-genetics COVID-19 system 2) Identification of neutralizing antibodies 3) Development and evaluation of candidate vaccines Additionally, the project will generate data on the safety of candidate vaccines in humans through a phase I trial. This will help determine which vaccines can be advance for further study. This will be accomplished through synergistic research between the biotechnology companies Medicago and Inovio in conjunction with several academic research laboratories. Dr. Kobinger's group has an established track record of translational research, and has successfully brought a DNA-vaccine against MERS-CoV to phase I clinical trials 24 months after commencing the project and in less than 7 months for Zika virus. He has led multinational collaborations in the past, and has a history of promoting collaborative and transparent consortium-based research programs. This proposal will develop tools that can be shared with the world scientific community that will help further our understanding of viral pathogenesis, transmission as well as screen potential small-molecule inhibitors and antibodies. Collectively, the findings from this project have potential to contribute to global response against COVID19.	Canadian Institutes of Health Research	Research Grant	999356.0 CAD

Yet, the existing COVID-19 research roadmap and WHO R&D Blueprint are largely silent on the global ethical pathways required to guide and oversee rapid therapeutics and vaccine R&D in this context (including whether and how such pathways ought to be modified, or precisely what solidarity and equity require for these activities). To identify and successfully navigate these ethical and regulatory pathways for COVID-19 R&D, we can look to the unprecedented R&D response to the 2013-16 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak for guidance. Only five months following the development of the first study protocols for EVD, the first patients were enrolled in clinical trials. Only four years later, the first vaccine was licensed in the United States. The atypical expediency of these R&D efforts was, in part, a product of significant modifications and adaptations to the usual ethical and regulatory pathways for health product development-pathways that involve ethical inputs into study protocols, independent ethics review of studies, global consultation and governance, data sharing agreements, and the approval, licensure, and dissemination of resulting products. This project will for the first time (1) analyze and describe the ethical pathways for R&D that existed or were established for EVD in order to aid the global research community in navigating these pathways for COVID-19 R&D; (2) analyze and describe the ethical pathways as they are established and navigated for COVID-19 R&D in order to rapidly support ongoing and future COVID-19 R&D; and (3) compare and conduct an ethical analysis of the ethical pathways for EVD and COVID-19 R&D to inform future R&D during epidemics.

Building on the expertise, research instruments, and networks developed through the SSHRC-funded Hungry Cities Partnership, our objectives are to: 1) Investigate the immediate food security challenges resulting from China's quarantine measures, unstable food supply, and fear of food shopping in two COVID-19 affected cities (Wuhan and Nanjing); 2) Compare food security status in Nanjing following the COVID-19 outbreak with baseline data collected through Hungry Cities in 2015; and 3) Synthesize and assess policies established to address food security challenges and promote effective measures by engaging local stakeholders. Our Canadian-Chinese research team has strong multidisciplinary expertise in food security evaluation, food policy analysis and the social and food security impacts of infectious diseases. Using a mixed-methods approach, we will generate rapid answers to Objective 1 through an online household survey and follow-up telephone interviews with residents of Wuhan and Nanjing, and a complementary inventory of immediate policy measures. Building on the survey instruments and established connections developed through the Hungry Cities Partnership, we will address Objective 2 through a longitudinal analysis to evaluate changes in household food security before and after the COVID-19 epidemic. Objective 3 will be addressed through a policy analysis and in-depth interviews with diverse local stakeholders. Outcomes will be relevant to academics, international organizations, and policymakers involved in efforts to strengthen food provisioning amid the epidemic in China. Results will also be useful to policymakers in other countries at risk of food security during infection disease outbreaks.	Canadian Institutes of Health Research	Research Grant	438241.0 CAD

As of February 18 2020, 73,439 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in 29 countries around the world with an attributed 1,875 deaths. The World Health Organization recently declared COVID-19 as a global health emergency. Studies on H1N1 and other pandemics show that Indigenous communities in Canada suffered most from these diseases. Responses to H1N1 were often inadequate and at worst created more harm than good. Communities had poor access to medical experts and supplies. Indigenous organizations were mostly excluded from decision-making. And misinformation generated much fear that still persists today. Yet, many Indigenous communities and organizations also responded effectively and, with others, eventually found ways to reduce the impacts of H1N1. The outbreak of COVID-19 thus represents a critical moment. On one hand the same mistakes could be made, with similar impacts. On the other hand, there is an opportunity to do things differently in ways that are grounded in the priorities of Indigenous communities and organizations. The goal of this project is to evaluate the implications of past and existing responses to pandemics with respect to Indigenous communities across Canada and to address any gaps in understanding and support related to COVID-19 and future pandemics. This collaborative project will focus on the past by documenting experiences with other pandemics and explore changes in response over time. It will focus on the present by assessing current state of community emergency planning and risk communication. Finally, it will focus on the future by assessing community responses to different possible scenario and ideas for moving forward. We will share our outcomes with Indigenous communities and organizations across Canada, all levels of governments, and the general public so that the health interests of Indigenous people are best served now and into the future.

As a global city, Toronto is home to one of the most highly-travelled populations in the world. It has been a significant receiving geography of a number of global infectious diseases. The project aims to understand the relationships among health risk perception, community prevention behaviour and individual activity space during the on-going global COVID-19 outbreak. Disease transmission in an urban centre is directly influenced by individual activity space and the effectiveness of preventive measures taken in a community, which is largely shaped by perception of the disease and its risk. The project will (1) explore the perception of COVID-19 and its risks among groups with different immigration status, socio-economic-demographic characteristics within Toronto's Chinese community; (2) examine how risk perception shapes prevention behaviour and individual activity space; and (3) assess how activity space is influenced by risk perception, prevention practices, and other factors through spatial-quantitative, mapping and qualitative analysis. Data will be collected from a community survey on risk perception, prevention behaviour and daily mobility, and focus groups on coping strategies. The project will contribute to the global response to the COVID-19 outbreak by providing evidence- based findings on community prevention behaviour in a large urban hub. It will reveal local perspectives, citizen approaches and community practices as outbreak response effort, and enhance our understanding of the cultural dimensions of the epidemic. It will yield implications for public health response in setting policies under time constraints and uncertainty, allocating resources, identifying high-risk groups and setting vaccine priority.

816	S. Michelle Driedger	University of Manitoba	None	None	None	The Paradox of Precaution: Examining Public Health COVID- 19 Outbreak Management Strategies	In any outbreak, public health focuses on surveillance, containment, and providing recommendations for how the public can stay safe: wash hands, cover coughs, stay home when sick, and get vaccinated if one is available. While this is similar messaging to what is heard in cold/flu season, what separates these events apart is the inherent uncertainty involved during the emergence of a novel virus. However, when public health best practice (e.g. quarantining returning nationals from Wuhan) is attacked as putting people in "medical jails", or when the WHO implores governments for emergency resources to manage the outbreak by declaring the novel virus as "public enemy number one" akin to a "global threat potentially worse than terrorism", it creates a paradox around the concept of precaution. There is an urgent need to examine the cultural, social and political responses to the management of the current outbreak in real time. The objectives of this research are: 1) to evaluate how cautionary public health messages for the outbreak are presented by the news media; 2) to evaluate whether public health agencies are using social media and how well these tools, if used, increase public understanding of these outbreaks; 3) to assess how members of the general public, including special targeted groups, understand the outbreak, both the risks of disease and the risks of contraction; 4) to evaluate how effectively members of the public feel they can protect themselves given public health outbreak communication, and how they make sense of this relative to seasonal influenza risk messaging; and 5) to assess public response to a novel vaccine if one becomes available. We will meet these objectives through a content analysis of news media stories / social media, and interviews with public health communication leads (objs 1&2) and focus groups/surveys with members of the general public and targeted communities (e.g. Indigenous peoples, Asians) in select Canadian cities (objs 3-5).

817	Anita R Kothari	University of Western Ontario	None	None	None	What is the public health risk communication response to COVID-19 in the context of social media?	Keeping Canadians safe requires a robust public health system. This is especially true when there is a public health emergency, like the novel Coronavirus outbreak. Social media, like twitter and Facebook, is an important information channel because most people use the internet for their health information. The public health sector can use social media during emergency events for: 1) public health messaging, 2) monitoring misinformation, and 3) responding to questions and concerns raised by the public. In this study we ask: What is the public health risk communication response to an emergency infectious disease in the context of social media? We examine how provinces and provincial public health leaders, and the Public Health Agency of Canada and national public heath leaders engage with the public using social media during the Coronavirus event. We compare findings to provincial and national public heath social media activity before the emergency. We also compare findings to the gold standard - WHO social media activity during the emergency. Using our study findings, we will work with public health stakeholders to collaboratively develop a much- needed Canadian social media emergency response set of guideline recommendations for public health and other health system organizations.

WHO and others are launching clinical trials of novel anti-virals. We have a unique opportunity to complement trials of anti-virals with investigation of modulation of the human host response to improve outcomes of COVID-19. We are proposing to "repurpose" a class of drugs (ARBs) for hypertension (high blood pressure) that have been shown to prevent lung injury in influenza and could work on corona because influenza and coronavirus bind to the same cell receptor in the lung. ARBs are commonly prescribed for high blood pressure (50-70% of patients). To date, there have been no clinical studies of ARBs in COVID-19. We call our study ARBs CORONA. We believe that ARBs can decrease the severity of COVID-19 and mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 infected adults. We will evaluate safety and effectiveness of available ARBs in COVID-19 in a multicentre study of 497 hospitalized adult patients who are or are not already on ARBs. Key personnel are in place to expedite this study. If this study is successful, ARBs can potentially limit complications and mortality of COVID-19. Potential results: ARBs are inexpensive clinically available cardiovascular drugs. If this study is successful, ARBs can potentially be used globally to limit complications and death due to COVID-19.

Since the symptoms of the COVID-19 disease are similar to many other illnesses, accurate detection and correct identification of the virus in a patient is important to know whether or not the patient is suffering from COVID-19 versus another disease. The current gold-standard detection uses sophisticated molecular biology that must be done in a laboratory by trained technicians. Our research team has developed LabAnywhere, a system intended for rugged use in agriculture. Its called LabAnywhere because it is designed for use in a barn or farm field where there may not be any clean enclosed space to do complex sample handling. The viruses are different in veterinary medicine, but with some modifications, the technology can be applied to human diseases in remote settings. The proposed research will piggyback upon existing projects. The research team; a design engineer, along with experts in medical biophysics, protein chemistry, and veterinary diseases have been testing a pen-side system for the livestock industries. The design is a simple, easy to deploy handheld system for a molecular biologic assay where there is no laboratory available, such as on a ship at sea or in a remote community many days travel from a laboratory. The project will use easily handled, safe viruses from the animal world for initial testing to validate the methods, then move to tests using human viruses once initial trials are complete.

820	Marceline Côté	University of Ottawa	None	None	None	Drug repurposing for the rapid development and evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 antivirals	The initial symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, shortness of breath and a dry cough. For some patients, the disease progresses to pneumonia as the infection spreads to the lung and leads severe inflammation. These severe symptoms can cause difficulties for the lungs to oxygenate the blood and can lead to death. There are currently no antivirals against SARS-CoV2, the causative agent of COVID-19, and development of new molecules can take years to reach patients. As the COVID-19 epidemic is progressing rapidly, the need for antiviral therapy is urgent. Therefore, our goal is to use our current arsenal of approved drugs already tested for their safety and used in the clinic for various conditions and repurpose them to treat COVID-19. In this rapid response grant, we propose to identify drugs with activity against SARS-CoV2 in vitro and in vivo and contribute to the global COVID-19 response and provide a therapeutic option for patients developing life-threatening disease.

Coronaviruses are associated with a variety of human diseases ranging from the common cold to new and serious conditions such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which emerged in 2002, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), first reported in 2012, and a recent and still growing outbreak of COVID-19, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. MERS and SARS together claimed over 1600 lives, and the death toll of COVID-19 recently passed 1300 and is growing rapidly. It is currently unclear if the COVID-19 outbreak can be contained, with some estimates of potential fatalities reaching as high as 50 million. There is currently no approved treatment for any coronavirus, although clinical trials of the Gilead compound Remdesivir are currently underway and there is some optimism that it may be effective against SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, there is an urgent need for additional potential SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics, as the success of Remdesivir is far from assured. We are proposing to use a combination of computer calculations and laboratory testing to rapidly identify and validate molecules that block an enzyme that is essential to the virus. The targeted enzyme, known as 3CLpro, is responsible for processing viral proteins into their active forms. A detailed 3D structure of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro enzyme was recently solved, and this provides enough information to identify chemical structures of molecules that are likely to block its action, through a procedure known as virtual screening. We will synthesize promising compounds and test them against the purified enzyme using a technique known as Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC). Our team has a proven track record of using virtual screening and ITC to generate potent inhibitors of enzymes similar to 3CLpro. Molecules we identify are likely to prevent the virus from replicating and would have high value as new potential treatments for COVID-19 that could be used alone or in combination with other therapies	Canadian Institutes of Health Research	Research Grant	203000.0 CAD
822	Chen Liang	Institute for Medical Research (Mtl)	None	None	None	Understand the high pathogenicity and zoonotic transmission of the COVID-19 virus: evasion of host innate immune responses	Coronaviruses are not new to humans. The human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E were discovered as early as in the 1960s. Both viruses cause common cold, a mild infection of our upper respiratory tract. However, the story started to change in 2002 when SARS broke out in China and other countries. This outbreak was caused by a new coronavirus which originally came from bats. Most importantly, this SARS coronavirus is highly pathogenic, with a fatality as high as 10%. Ten years later, a more deadly coronavirus caused the MERS outbreak. Now, a new coronavirus came back, is raging in China, may cause a global pandemic if not controlled. This new virus, COVID-19 (or SARS-CoV-2), has infected more and killed more than the total number by both SARS and MERS. Two urgent questions need to be addressed. How did these coronaviruses transmit from animals into humans? What have made them so pathogenic and lethal? Humans are protected from viral diseases by the immune system. These pathogenic coronaviruses must have found ways to evade the immune responses so that they can spread in humans and cause fatal illness. We thus propose this research to elucidate how this COVID-19 virus does this. The findings will identify the key viral genes that suppress immune responses by blocking essential signaling pathways. Our results will open new avenues for the development of effective interventions to halt the COVID-19 break.	Canadian Institutes of Health Research	Research Grant	480000.0 CAD

Research to evaluate intervention strategies can help decision-makers to identify the type and intensity of control measures needed for containment. We propose to investigate the severity and healthcare resource utilization during potential outbreaks, estimate the transmissibility and the percentage of the population that could be affected, and predict clinical outcomes and critical care demand. We will use modelling and simulation for nearly real-time estimates of public health and healthcare interventions in Canada, the US and India. Our specific research objectives are to: 1) Predict the scope of disease transmission, potential outbreaks, and clinical attack rates. 2) Project what hospitals will require for isolation, ambulatory services, emergency and hospital admissions, and critical care of symptomatic patients. 3) Assess the potential effects of various non-pharmacologic interventions, including quarantine, self-reporting and isolation, and school closure. 4) Evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine and determine best scenarios to distribute a vaccine based on population age and risk of disease severity. To achieve these objectives, we will develop new and adapt existing mathematical models to simulate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in outbreak scenarios. Our team has access to a number of databases including daily reports on incidence of confirmed and suspected cases, hospitalization, and deaths attributed to COVID-19 in China. Using demographics of the Canadian, US, and Indian populations, we will evaluate the effectiveness of vaccination strategies, hospital surge capacity, and social policies such as quarantine and closing schools.

As numerous urban and social activities involve logistics, it means that effective epidemic logistical response and planning is key to secure social security and prosperity, now and the future. Hitherto, however, there is a serious scarcity of knowledge on how the logistical system can adapt to epidemic outbreak. There is an urgency to investigate whether epidemic logistical planning approach is appropriate. Hence, by focusing on Covid-19, the goal of this project is to develop effective logistical strategies and solutions to tackle the social impacts caused by sudden, large-scale epidemic outbreak so as to enhance the resilience of cities, countries, and societies. It strives to achieve five key objectives: 1) to investigate how individuals and societies with difference characteristics (e.g., age, jobs) perceive and react to the social impacts of and logistical strategy in tackling Covid-19, 2) to identify attributes that can catalyze information sharing and coordination between cities and countries in epidemic logistical planning, 3) to identify ways that can facilitate the transfer of strategies and solutions to cities and countries under diversified geographical and cultural contexts, especially those with relatively weak health systems, 4) to investigate how governments plan and respond to the different logistical needs of society in the outburst of a sudden, large-scale epidemic at different stages; and 5) to develop strategies, solutions, and a supporting framework to governments and societies to mitigate the rapid spread of Covid-19 in terms of logistical service control, especially for vulnerable groups and areas. By improving the logistical response and planning, we strongly believe that this project will secure healthier and more secure societies in Canada, China, and around the world in the long term.

Experience from overseas demonstrates the profound impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on populations. The pandemic has potential to worsen health inequalities because people with existing health conditions (common in Māori and Pasifika) are more likely to become severely ill. However, large-scale measures to control the spread of the virus are likely to have the worst impact on those who can least afford it. To avoid these harms, our team of experts will provide ongoing analysis of information from multiple sources about pandemic impact and the lived experience of those with the infection and their whānau. We will rapidly communicate these insights to decision-makers at the Ministry of Health, service providers, communities, other Pacific nations, and the public in the form of practical recommendations to guide current and future pandemic responses.

COVID-19 is placing unprecedented pressure on the global healthcare workforce and many healthcare workers have been infected. In Italy, for example, almost 1 in 10 infections have occurred in healthcare workers. Preventing infections in healthcare workers has been identified as a key strategic objective by the WHO and is vital for health services that are likely to be faced with unprecedented demand. Hydroxychloroquine is active against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. It has an established role in malaria prophylaxis with weekly dosing and costs 8 cents per tablet. We plan a randomised clinical trial that will evaluate the role of hydroxychloroquine for SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis in front-line healthcare workers. The primary end point will be laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2. The trial will start if the number of cases of COVID-19 increases in New Zealand from the current levels, and will involve a range of frontline healthcare workers.

The main goal is that of reverse-engineering the manipulation of information providing citizens with the means to act as fact checkers. We believe that fostering global digital activism constitutes a necessary means to fight the current info-pandemic. The majority of fact-checking and myth-busting sites (e.g. EUvsDisinfo, https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters) counter false narratives and news that have already become viral, unable to prevent their spread. Furthermore, AI techniques (http://www.fakenewschallenge.org) are currently not accurate enough to replace humans in generalised fact-checking. This is especially the case when the news does not contain fabricated information (disinformation), but it is framed in such a way that true evidence is used to draw false generalizations and evaluations (Wardle 2019), resulting in semi-fake news. Leveraging NLP techniques for topic modelling and frame analysis (Das et al. 2010) we will trace the topics and frames which characterize semi-fake COVID-19 news using FullFact (https://fullfact.org/) and the Coronavirus debunking archive built by First Draft (https://firstdraftnews.org/long-form-article/coronavirus-resources-for-reporters/) as benchmarks. We will identify the fallacious reasonings in the sample and use the results to compile a set of guidelines about how to detect semi-fake COVID-19 news. These principles will be operationalised in a digital platform with a chatbot for training citizens to spot misinformation. Citizens who have been trained will have access to the Fake News Immunity platform, working together with experts in the common effort of flagging semi-fake news.

829	Andrea Baronchelli	City, University of London	None	None	None	COVID-19: Monitoring the effects of the pandemic on illicit online trade.	The pandemic has reshaped the demand for goods and services worldwide. Economic stress, the public health emergency and disinformation-driven panic have pushed customers, and vendors, towards the shadow economy. In particular, Dark web marketplaces (DWMs), commercial websites easily accessible via free software like Tor, have acquired significant popularity. They accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to broker transactions often involving drugs, weapons, and other illicit goods. UK presence on DWMs is strong: As of April 6, 86% of COVID-19 related listings on DWMs would ship to UK and 45% were shipped from UK. This project will build an infrastructure to monitor dark web trading in COVID-19-related goods and services. First, we will monitor listings on DWMs to detect changes in types and prices of COVID-19-related goods and services (e.g., facemasks, prescription drugs, scams). Second, we will analyse patterns of Bitcoin (or other cryptocurrency) transactions involving DWMs and their users to quantify policy-relevant changes in trading activity patterns and customer behaviour. The rapid evolution of the pandemic requires gathering and analysing critical data quickly, and a strong research effort to improve the current understanding of DWMs. Our interdisciplinary research team is perfectly equipped for this challenge. Live results shared in reports and a dedicate website will (i) uncover market demand and supply of critical goods and services, (ii) support policymakers’ plans for their provision and (iii) assist and complement the UK’s effort to combat disinformation about coronavirus, scams, and to counter panic-buying of counterfeit goods that could threat public health.

830	Thomas Kirchmaier	London School of Economics	None	None	None	COVID-19: Outreach to Domestic Abuse Victims in Times of Quarantine	Domestic abuse (DA) is an extensive social problem, marked by high levels of repeat victimization and underreporting. Domestic violence reported to the police has risen since the beginning of quarantine, yet there is concern that actual incidents have risen even more, since underreporting may have increased. When the victim and abuser are quarantined together, calling the police may pose great risk to the victim’s safety. We will consider whether it is possible to reach isolated DA victims by non-traditional means, and if by providing them a safer means of contacting police, DA reporting increases. We also seek to determine whether contacting police during quarantine will influence recidivism in the future. We propose to work with two police forces to reach potential high-risk DA victims by means of a targeted two-month social media campaign. The goal of the campaign is to inform potential victims about the Silent Solution, a safer means of reporting to police. Potential high-risk victims will be identified from police administrative records using machine learning methods. We will take two different approaches to targeting. In each case, half of the high-risk group will be randomly assigned to treatment status (receiving targeted social media messages) and half to control (only ambient messaging). We will compare the treatment and control groups to measure how the media campaigns affect current reporting and future recidivism. If the approach proves effective, it has the potential to increase reporting, and inform the allocation of protective resources, both during and after quarantine.

Several environmental factors likely to be affected by quarantine measures (such as sleep (9–17), parenting style and social interactions (18–22), screen use (23–27), and outdoor activities/exercise (28)) are known predictors of language and executive function development. The proposed study will follow up a UK-wide cohort of 600 children aged 8 to 36 months of age, enrolled in an online study at the onset of social distancing measures, to capture changes in key environmental variables and measure their impact on children’s vocabulary size and executive function. Using sophisticated analyses on a large and diverse sample, we will examine the role of each factor on children’s cognitive abilities. At this time of unforeseen and ongoing change, it is imperative to understand the impacts of the lockdown on cognition during a critical period for development (0 to 3 years of age), and then find strategies to minimise disruption to this cohort. Our findings will identify approaches that mitigate the temporary loss of formal early years’ education, identify those groups most at risk of adverse consequences, and inform policy on how to remediate the negative impacts of lockdown post-COVID-19.

Viral evolution is a major characteristic of all RNA viruses leading to accelerated evolution and adaptability to new environments. Our working hypothesis is that specific SARS-CoV-2 variants will be selected, as the virus is passing through a vast set of individuals with diverse HLA alleles and co-infections. The mutations fixed in this process can affect viral properties such as transmission or replication rates, that finally may modulate coronavirus disease (COVID-19) progression. The overall goal of this interdisciplinary consortium is to elucidate whether the HLA background and respiratory viral co-infections play a role in SARS-CoV-2 evolution and adaptation to different Human populations as well as in the severity of COVID-19. The specific scientific questions of the consortium are: 1) to characterise the genetic variability of SARS-CoV-2 in NRW over time of the current outbreak and from possible future infections, and in comparison to other geographic regions; 2) to define the role of HLA as driving force for SARS-CoV-2 evolution and as a determinant for disease severity, using data from our patients as well as prevalence data from other countries; and 3) to define the role of respiratory viral co-infections and their implications for the severity of COVID-19 outcome and SARS-CoV-2 evolution. This will enable to optimise medical and quarantine measures.

Disease behavior is variable, with the majority of patients experiencing only mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. Some patients develop severe pulmonary affection, with aggressive and extensive inflammatory destruction of lung parenchyma and associated systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and superinfections, driving large fractions of the COVID-19 related mortality. What exactly drives this development of severe lung disease remains unknown, but old age, smoking, obesity, diabetes and other co-morbidities increase the risk. Variation in virus genetics and patient immunology are also likely involved. As to the latter, we hypothesize that host genetics may play a role in determining development of severe lung disease in COVID-19 infection. We here aim to address the following research questions: (1) Are there genetic signatures suggesting which biological mechanisms are involved that may suggest relevant therapeutic approaches? (2) Can we predict those at risk (or those with very low risk)? (3) Are specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles/haplotypes associated with COVID19 disease? (4) Are blood groups of relevance in (a) the infection process and (b) in disease severity? Until today, no well-powered genetic analysis has been performed. To this end, we have collected 5,000 blood samples from some of the most strongest affected regions in Europe, including a significant fraction of severe COVID19 patients from intensive care units.

It offers high sensitivity, short turnaround times and wide availability, and may thus complement RT-PCR tests, especially in situations of unclear clinical presentation, such as a negative RT-PCR despite strong anamnestic evidence for COVID-19. More importantly, it may offer opportunities to directly assess the stage of progression of the disease as observed directly from the affected lung tissue, and may thus be a method of choice for therapy response assessment in upcoming trials of new therapeutic agents. However, in order to develop it into a suitable tool for these purposes, a reproducible, standardized, and quantitative approach to image diagnostics is required. This proposal aims to develop such a standardized diagnostic and staging procedure for COVID-19 cases, using an AI-supported approach to select clinical attributes that serve as optimal predictors of the presence and stage of the disease.

Our mixed-methods approach includes (1) a national, representative, repeated measures survey of up to 1,050 German households (3.5% of 30,000 households contacted), (2) follow-up interviews across Germany (n = 90 over 3 intervals), (3) a diary method to understand the nuances of everyday life under dramatically new conditions, (4) an online ethnography on Twitter to understand how a range of public health & affective content is received/communicated by diverse audiences (5) content analysis of mainstream media/public health releases. This approach will help us to understand a range of research questions covering the ethical, legal & socio-economic dimensions of the COVID-19 outbreak, including how individuals & communities perceive risks and protective behaviours related to COVID-19 with regards to individual human rights, pro-social ethical duties & their own socio-economic situations; how public understandings of the disease evolve as a result of information production, reception and internalisation processes; how these vary across diverse populations and demographics; how German citizens are experiencing stigmatization and negative outcomes. The results will inform discussions pertaining to what local knowledge can be mobilized to help, & how pro-social behaviours can be fostered.

However, the lockdown implies a societal, economic, and psychological cost that is not sustainable for too long. Shifting the focus onto the 'exit strategy' will be an urgent matter within a few months, if not weeks. From the way talk about exit strategy is currently framed, it might appear that it will be a matter of technical decisions or, as the Government put it, a matter 'of taking the right steps at the right time, informed by the best science'. But this is only partly true. Policy makers will need to show commitment to ethical principles and be able to justify decisions to sacrifice certain values and principles for the sake of others, which will be unavoidable. The exit strategy cannot be designed and implemented unless certain ethical decisions about trade-offs between different values are made. For example, decisions will need to be made about if and when to increase risk of illness or even death for certain individuals for the sake the psychological or financial interest of those who are being most heavily affected by the lockdown. Or to sacrifice to a certain degree privacy for the sake of public health in the use of contact-tracing technologies. Or again to use some level of coercion to enforce vaccination policies, when a vaccine becomes available. These decisions ar not merely about "the best science". These are ethical decisions. It will not be possible to make these decisions without having a plausible story about which values will at some point have to be prioritized, and why. This is not only because policy decisions need to be ethically acceptable (which is always a requirement, even in 'normal' times), but also because without appealing to certain ethical values, that go beyond merely technical considerations, it will be difficult to gain people's trust. This research will result in a set of recommendations, in the form of policy papers addressed to the relevant Government departments as well as academic papers, about how to make these necessary trade-offs between values in a way that can inform both public health policy and public health communication strategy. This project addresses, in chronological order, three core steps of the exit strategies that require close ethical scrutiny: 1) at what point, and through which steps, will it be acceptable to start the path back to some form of normality? 2) what kind of contact-tracing technologies (e.g mobile apps) can be used during the transition, and how? 3) when we have a vaccine, which vaccination policy should be adopted? There is also more general question about the level of coercion a Government may ethically enforce. This is an ethics project intended to inform policy making. As such, the methodological approach will be the standard one adopted in applied ethics projects, which include strategy to ensure the outcomes have practical relevance and provide feasible and easily implementable advice. I will test ethical intuitions against ethical theories and vice versa, in search for maximal coherence ("reflective equilibrium"), so that the conclusions will be as much as possible in line with shared values; use thought experiments - i.e. fictitious examples - to test future scenarios against hypothetical ones, in order to ensure the advice provided is consistent with people intuitions across various scenarios; survey different ethical points of view to identify strengths and weaknesses of each, to ensure ethical advice is informed by a pluralistic perspective.

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted on the UK’s food systems, and disruptions are likely to continue. There is emerging evidence that the local food sector (local food producers and their supply chains) can significantly contribute to the resilience of the UK’s food system at this time. However, robust data is needed to better understand the impact this sector can make on food security during and after the pandemic, and to help maximise its contribution. By working closely with key businesses and organisations in the local food sector, this 5-stage project will use surveys, interviews, citizen science, and backcasting to provide timely evidence on1. the sectors’ robustness, capturing the impact of and response to the pandemic (deliverable 1);2. its adaptability, gathering information on adaptation by local producers, short chains andintermediate actors (deliverables 2 & 3);3. its route to transformation in the post-pandemic context, assessing longer-term changes atsupply chain and policy levels (deliverables 4 & 5).The project will collect and feeding back robust data, and by providing structured space for sectorwide collaboration and long-term planning. It will thu enable the business and policy actors on local and national levels to maximise the local food system's contribution to UK’s food security, and to ensure its sustainability and resilience. This project has significant buy-in from key businesses and organisations in this sector, as well as policymakers, as evidenced by letters of support. It is therefore highly likely to ensure high participation rates and deliver significant impact.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	158867.0 GBP
868	Julia Jones	Bangor University	None	None	2021-07-16	The impact of Covid-19 restrictions on recreation and use of green space in Wales	The use of green spaces for recreation has acknowledged benefits for physical and mental health, to the extent of reducing mortality rates [1]. Green spaces include parks and gardens in urban areas, and the wider countryside in more rural settings. There is, however, great inequality in access to green spaces for different sections of society. People from more deprived backgrounds suffer from a lack of quality local green space, but also the means to travel to more distant green space, and use of green spaces tends to decrease with age. A key policy aim is to increase use of green spaces by all sectors of society.Variation in people’s use of green spaces remains poorly understand. The social distancing regulations implemented during the Covid-19 pandemic both restrict travel, but also emphasise the importance of exercising locally. This provides a fascinating ‘natural experiment’ into how the use of green spaces is affected by these regulations. In particular, do we find that different sections of society are affected differently as distant travel is discouraged, but permitted exercise increases use of local green spaces?In January 2020, we surveyed >1000 people, obtaining a representative sample from across Wales. Data showed where, why and how people access green spaces, and the benefits they derive. Repeating this survey during the period of restricted travel and as the UK recovers from the coronavirus crisis will provide unique insight on how people benefit from natural spaces and how this was impacted by Covid-19.1. http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/POST-PN-0538/POST-PN-0538.pdf	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	9058.0 GBP

These events are exposing the major inequalities that underpin British society across class, ethnic, national, migrant, generational and geographical identities. They are also both high profile public events and processes that generate media and government information. The proposed research sets out to examine the resonances and contrasts in the ways in which the inequalities of COVID-19 and Brexit have been framed by the media and everyday experiences. Understanding these inequalities and their potential effects on social and political polarisation is crucial to answering how and in what shape British democracy emerges from Brexit and COVID -19. To do this, we will conduct new research on individual experiences and media narratives that builds on existing data collection about Brexit Britain. By building on this previous research, we can provide a unique longitudinal understanding of the social and political impact of COVID19 in Brexit Britain. The research will begin in May 2020 with the first wave of a panel survey and initial media content analysis collected during the lockdown period, with a second wave of the panel survey taking place in September 2020 when it is expected that some restrictions will have been lifted, and a third wave in January 2021, which will provide the context for and coincide with the beginning of six months of ethnographic research with participants we previously interviewed as part of a Brexit project.

This will use confidential information from firm-level surveys conducted by the Confederation of Business Industry (CBI), made available to us through a special agreement between CBI and the Centre for Economic Performance. The data are unique in providing rich, real-time, firm-level information on current trends and expectations. The surveyed firms have a broad coverage of sectors and regions and our previous work shows that they can deliver nationally representative economic analysis. Supplementing CBI survey data with firm and industry characteristics from ONS and company accounts, a second key output of the project will examine the channels through which businesses are being affected by Covid, such as demand, supply chains, and finance, and the interaction (if any) between these impacts and the effects of Brexit. The project will identify the heterogeneity of impacts by firm-size, sector, and region, and the evolution of business activity as the economy recovers and the UK leaves the EU. The granular findings will help design detailed policy responses.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	158951.0 GBP

Coronaviruses are transmitted person-to-person, however COVID-19 also persists on surfaces for several days (van Doremalen et al. 2020). Consequently, this pandemic is severely impacting the waste management sector; causing disposal and recycling service disruptions, and putting waste workers at risk. Before the emergence of COVID-19 this heavily marketised and deregulated sector – comprising over 3,000 companies – was already associated with elevated rates of death and injury compared to other sectors in the UK (HSE 2019). This project asks to what extent the UK waste management sector is equipped to meet the unprecedented challenges generated by this pandemic. The interdisciplinary project works in partnership with national industry associations and local authorities to investigate how this critical sector is responding to, and affected by, COVID-19 – particularly in terms of the safety of its workers. It aims to mitigate hazards related to waste management during the outbreak through three interrelated approaches: 1) the project generates urgent data on the sector’s rapidly changing waste management practices. It employs social research methods to examine pivotal processes, including collections, disposal, and administration; 2) the project collaborates with key workers to map the sector and design a pandemic toolkit that can amplify workers’ voices in decision-making; and 3) in collaboration with the Waste Industry Safety and Health Forum, this project creates guidelines and an industry report to enable greater co-ordination between authorities. This research addresses both the immediate crisis and contributes to future preparedness plans.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	247572.0 GBP
874	Konstantinos Angelopoulos	University of Glasgow	None	None	2021-07-16	Assessing policy to address the medium-run impact of COVID-19 on income and health inequality with models informed by the history of disease outbreaks	This research aims to inform policy by assessing interventions to mitigate the medium-run implications of COVID-19 on income and health inequality. The uniqueness of our work is that we will develop models to predict inequalities that are consistent with medium-run historical postoutbreak dynamics in a large city, Glasgow, demonstrating similar inequalities to those seen across the UK today. The medium run is important because impacts of COVID-19 for inequalities are expected to persist for many years. Assessing mitigation policies requires models that can correctly predict the evolution of income and health distributions many years after an outbreak. To achieve this, we need to combine models typically applied to modern datasets with quantitative data from historical periods that, unlike contemporary data, cover sufficiently extended post-outbreak periods. Records have been especially high quality in Glasgow since the last quarter of the 19th century, covering a period of intense and volatile economic activity, and multiple disease outbreaks. Building on team expertise, we will: (1) construct mathematical models that predict income and health inequality after disease outbreaks; (2) compile quantitative historical data alongside contemporary datasets that capture the pre-COVID-19 situation for calibration and validation; and (3) assess the effects of policies relating to e.g. tax and benefits, upskilling subsidies, and diseasespecific or general health service provision. Our framework will allow us to assess policy interventions conditional on socioeconomic and health characteristics such as health status, professional class and income position, thus providing fine-grained results for economic and public health policy advisers nationally and locally.

The current pandemic situation will inevitably lead to an increased demand for hygienically packaged products and the continued drive toward a reduction in carbon and plastic waste. We aim to develop anti-microbial, biodegradable (ABD) wrapping film designed for packing cold or chilled food products in takeaways, bakeries and bread-makers (e.g. sandwiches, artisan bread and shortcrust pastry) with improved anti-microbial properties. This film will not increase the burden on the environment, unlike contemporary conventional plastic wrapping films when left behind it will degrade. It will be produced regionally reducing its carbon footprint and creating local employment opportunities. It will be capable of being produced internationally adding to UK exports, and competitiveness of the British economy.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	49880.0 GBP
876	HYDRUS PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED	HYDRUS PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED	None	None	None	Virus Safe Textiles	Hydrus Purification Technologies are the team behind Hydrus-75, a sodium hypochlorite sanitiser used by the NHS as a surface disinfectant and in hygienic wipes. It delivers exceptional results at low concentration levels. Our novel coating for hard or flexible surfaces and textiles meets the urgent need for Personal Protective Equipment and clothing for clinical and medical settings. This project will demonstrate coated textiles and garments which are intrinsically safe and re-useable. They will also be capable of production in the UK, using readily available textile machinery and industrial or domestic sewing machines. Much of the Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) currently used in clinical-medical environments is made from paper and plastic microfibres, blown or felted into tight meshes designed to block particles. Even the best FFP3 masks (costing <£4-each) do not block individual particles of viruses like Covid-19, they must be disposed of between patients and when moist (in FFP3 masks, about 2 hours).High tech fabric and graphene coatings are now coming to market, Graphene coated textiles can block virus particles and last longer, however production processes are costly and coatings degrade quickly. Even the best new masks can only be washed and safely re-used 3 to 6 times. Clearly the ideal for surgical clothing is a highly protective, safe, washable, re-useable solution which offers mask level protection, yet making gowns and surgical clothing with such textiles is currently prohibitively costly.Graphene coated textiles are extremely durable - earlier versions of our coating are found in expensive sportswear for extreme environments. Our coating can block virus particles 10x smaller than the best existing PPE. By preventing liquid penetration to its base layer, our textile remains useable for longer periods during sessional-use. Between patients, masks using our textile can be sprayed with Hydrus75 (a highly effective, low cost disinfectant product we already supply to the NHS) for immediate re-use, or washed and dried for re-use later the same day. It can even be zapped with electricity to disinfect it. Our re-useable PPE also has a positive environmental impact, greatly reduce the quantities required, whilst at and relieving supply issues.; In China alone 192k-tonnes of used surgical masks are disposed of annually, from clinical settings alone. This toxic waste is either incinerated, or inappropriately landfilled.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	49933.0 GBP
877	FUTURE HEALTH WORKS LTD	FUTURE HEALTH WORKS LTD	None	None	None	Leveraging Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision to Deliver Surgery at Scale in a Post-COVID-19 World	COVID-19 has placed our healthcare services under extraordinary pressure. The decision to prioritise hospital capacity for COVID-19 and cancel planned surgery, to free up crucial resources, is the only option under these circumstances. However, this decision will have lasting consequences for both our society and healthcare system; 2.1+ million patients have had their surgery canceled, ([The Independent, 2020][0]), 33% of which are orthopaedic surgery (Royal College of Surgeons). With waiting lists already long (British Orthopaedic Association, 2020), these new, added cancellations will create an unprecedented burden, lasting years beyond the outbreak of COVID-19, with Patients potentially waiting years for treatment, with limited access to the support they need. When surgery returns, healthcare providers will need to continue to protect the "at risk age group" from COVID 19, avoiding unnecessary hospital appointments, and keeping inpatient admissions to a minimum. Technology can support the increased scale at which hospitals deliver orthopaedic surgery, freeing up healthcare professionals' time and reducing the cost of care. The introduction of remote monitoring can keep vulnerable patients safe, facilitate day case surgery and reduce complications and in-person appointments. Accurate clinical assessment of joint function (range of motion) is a key component to monitoring orthopaedic patients. This assessment supports decisions from rehabilitation to progress with recovery. Traditionally this assessment is delivered in-person by either a surgeon or physical therapist using a goniometer. We have developed technology using computer vision AI that can be remotely accessed through a smartphone camera. This independently-validated technology can provide clinical teams with the information they need to carry out assessments of joint function remotely. We propose to productise this technology through our mature, established digital orthopaedic patient engagement platform, that is already deployed within leading orthopaedic centres in the UK (NHS & Private), to deliver an end-to-end solution to remotely manage patients and enable widespread adoption. This proprietary, first-of-a-kind technology will provide immediate benefits to patients who are currently awaiting surgery without an operation date, whilst supporting healthcare providers deliver orthopaedic surgery at greater scale and protecting at-risk patients from COVID-19 . This technology will contribute to potential productivity gains of £120+ million per annum in the NHS by reducing the length of in-patient stay from 3 nights to 1 night for 40% of annual joint replacement procedures (200,000) and a further £12.5+ million by moving 10% of the 7.8 million of NHS trauma and orthopaedic outpatient clinics to virtual.

880	OCASTA STUDIOS LIMITED	OCASTA STUDIOS LIMITED	None	None	None	Remote clinical teaching technology for all UK medical schools	The Covid-19 pandemic has interrupted undergraduate medical teaching dramatically, by stopping classroom sessions and the ability of students to work in hospitals to gain clinical experience. **This has the potential to stop new doctors completing their training and so depriving the NHS of valuable staff at a time of unprecedented healthcare need.** To help answer this urgent issue the UK medical schools under coordination by the Medical Schools Council have come together to adopt the CAPSULE clinical learning platform to support remote learning (https://info.capsule.ac.uk). CAPSULE has been developed by the Brighton & Sussex Medical School and Ocasta, a leading eLearning solutions provider. CAPSULE is unique as it contains over 650 clinical cases with 3,500 questions, including medicine, surgery, paediatrics, psychiatry, therapeutics, obstetrics and gynaecology, general practice and professional studies. All content is supported by an editorial board of senior clinicians from all specialities, there is a rolling process of core review, case editing and selective case additions - maintaining active and relevant content. CAPSULE has been in use since 2016 in a small number of UK medical schools, however, the pandemic has spurred collaboration across the sector has allowed the educational content on CAPSULE to be updated and enhanced to support a faster, wider deployment. The project funded by the innovation grant will allow the platform to be further established as a learning tool, with capabilities to advance remote teaching facilities, to support better student progress tracking with tailored teach and to promote research into the effectiveness of remote teaching practices. Through this funding, CAPSULE will become an industry-proven platform to support an increasing industry move to remote, self-paced learning, supported by teaching sessions to cement understanding. This will lead to opportunities across other overseas territories for CAPSULE and a technology platform better able to be adapted for other market sectors and industry verticals.

881	LIGHTRICITY LIMITED	LIGHTRICITY LIMITED	None	None	None	Self-powered (mantenance-free) wireless asset-tracking and monitoring system for hospitals, healthcare and logistics	As evidenced in the Covid-19 pandemic, it is crucial that nurses and doctors' time is productively spent on patient care rather than wasted on finding missing equipment such as pumps, ventilators, beds, wheelchairs, blood pressure and ECG monitors. Studies have shown that medical staff can spend up to two hours-per-work shift searching for equipment. Multiple industry sources estimate that between 10% and 20% of hospital inventory is stolen or lost each year. Current solutions for tracking of assets in hospitals are based on battery-operated RFID or Bluetooth technologies. Such Real-Time Location System (RTLS) can show equipment location data. However, they suffer a large total Cost-of-Ownership (due to limited device lifetime and significant maintenance required), a lack of device interoperability and modularity (no possibility to easily upgrade the system). There is thus still reluctance within healthcare to deploy asset tracking solutions, despite the potential to save both money and lives. Installation expenses can indeed be high if the solution is not compatible with the hospital's already-existing network infrastructure and regulations. Operational costs will be also prohibitive if medical staff have to replace batteries in thousands of IoT devices. In this project, Lightricity (Oxford-based SME, spun-out from SHARP Labs) will focus on reducing overall cost-of-ownership by developing a completely autonomous (self-powered with indoor Photovoltaic cells) and modular wireless hardware solution for asset tracking and monitoring. Lightricity will demonstrate a standards-based systems which can support interoperability features with existing IoT cloud software and network infrastructures. The objectives of this project will be focussed on the development of 2 key demonstrators: * A prototype of self-powered indoor asset tracking device with general purpose real-time tracking capability. * An advanced self-powered indoor wireless monitoring device for detection of asset movements and monitoring of sensitive equipment. In the future, the developed technology will also find applicability in patient monitoring and tracing for the fight of spreading infections in hospitals and care-homes, transportation, and supply-chain management (logistics and retail).

882	GAME DR LIMITED	GAME DR LIMITED	None	None	None	Use of proven gaming technology to educate young people on COVID-19, promoting adherence to social distancing and providing a platform for trusted information dissemination	Multiple waves of infection transmission are anticipated for COVID-19 before a vaccine is developed. To flatten the curve and reduce deaths, governments have released guidance for general public focused on social distancing and hygiene behaviours. However, a standardised strategy to educate young people has not been established. Our pilot research has indicated that young people feel invincible against coronavirus, with only 17% of participants believing they will catch coronavirus and 35% believing they would catch it, but it would not make them ill. However, 10% reported concerns over "when it would be over". To this end, there is an urgent need to develop accessible resources for young people to ensure that government guidance is followed, and anxiety is alleviated. To meet this need, the project team aim to develop a mobile game to educate young people on COVID-19 . The video game will be developed on Unity game engine for mobile devices, allowing widespread uptake and dissemination. Backend game analytics will be used to map player knowledge gaps and attitudes towards COVID-19 . These data will be used to assess effectiveness of game and in combination with government data, to better understand barriers to government guidance, and social impacts of COVID-19 .

883	VIVACITY LABS LIMITED	VIVACITY LABS LIMITED	None	None	None	Improving automated collection of Social Distancing data from camera feeds	The Covid-19 Pandemic has brought about an unprecedented lockdown to global society. Data on the impact and effectiveness of the lockdown is critically important for the following reasons: * Epidemiology modelling needs to know the number of interactions that there are in society, and the change in these interactions following each intervention. * The lockdown rules are new, unprecedented and hard to enforce. As a result, there is a lot of uncertainty around compliance, and the effectiveness of government messaging and enforcement strategies. Data is critical in determining what the next move should be. * The police are under significant pressure, with many of their ranks in isolation. Being able to target lockdown enforcement to areas where there is a higher number of social interactions (<2m) is important. Vivacity currently provides anonymous road usage data from our smart sensors. This is the only available multi-modal data source which provides accurate data on the volume of pedestrians, cyclists, cars and commercial vehicles across the UK. Our data is already forming a key part of the Governments analysis on the effectiveness of the lockdown. In the first few weeks following the lockdown, we developed a new data output from the sensors, which measured the distance between pedestrians, and provided statistics on the number of <2m interactions. This current method does not give sufficient information to enable more detailed decisions to be made on the exact rules and enforcement of the lockdown. In this project we will: * Measurement of the duration of interactions - the longer people interact, the increased risk of infection * Provide social distancing measurement for cyclists, and between cyclists and pedestrians, so that the government can understand which outdoor exercise modes are more effective for social distancing * Look to classify the difference between "household groups" and interactions between "strangers", so that the data gathered is not used to discourage "household groups" who are currently allowed to go outside together from spending time together We will apply these new analysis methods to our existing network of sensors to provide over 450 data feeds across 16 cities in the UK. This data will help the Government plan the removal of the lockdown measures, and monitor that social interactions do not grow too quickly as restrictions are lifted.

Inspired by seeing patients struggling to breathe due to Covid-19, I am proposing the design and manufacture of (an economic) breathing resistance device which through use will increase lung strength/capacity in a well subject (to make them better prepared to fight the virus' effects on the lungs). After treatment for Covid-19 the same device can then be used to help train the lungs back up to full or improved health. I will deliver one 'standard device' for patients to use, with an accompanying website which has standardised training exercises and methodology for recording progress. As all elements of the design and training are standardised it will provide an easy and consistent vehicle for medical staff to remotely monitor patients improvement. By creating a standard device which is used nationally/globally anonymous patient data can be shared to give a broader sample base for researchers.

886	INTERCEDE VENTURES LTD	INTERCEDE VENTURES LTD	None	None	None	Aircraft Sanitisation Verification Service (ASVS)	The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the grounding of the majority of the world's fleet of aircraft. As the pandemic is brought under control and travel is again possible, maximising safety will be paramount. Virus particles, e.g. CORVID-19, can remain infectious in the air for hours and on surfaces up to days depending on the type of surface and the environmental conditions. In this context, in the future, airlines will place much greater importance on maintaining high standards of disinfection to prevent further dissemination and giving necessary reassurance to passengers. To keep travel costs at a reasonable level, it will be important to ensure that a disinfection process has been effective without increasing the "down time" of the aircraft. For rapidly disinfecting the whole of an aircraft interior, a technique known as "fogging" (i.e. spaying a thin mist of disinfectant in to the air, which then coats surfaces) is seen as critical for the future. The big issue with this is ensuring that the coverage is comprehensive. This project addresses this challenge. This five-month project will produce two key outputs. Novel, inexpensive, paper-based (biodegradable) patch sensors that can be distributed on a range of surfaces inside an aircraft before disinfection and that will change colour to show that the correct level of disinfection has been achieved. The patch sensors will use dyes that will change colour when they come in contact with the disinfectant used to clean the plane. The second aspect of the project will be the development of a reader, initially based on a smart phone platform, that can measure the colour and consequently determine the amount of disinfection. This can be displayed on the screen and sent to a central location that will record the results from all the sensors placed on that plane. The project will be delivered by Intercede Ventures Ltd, which comprises a team of former senior managers with the airline industry. Working with a UK-based sensor manufacture, a university, an international chemical distributor and partner airlines they will launch the product by the end of 2020 . The impact of the project will be huge in terms of passenger safety. In addition, it will help the airline and tourism industries recover from the COVID-19 crisis by giving airline passengers much needed confidence in the safety of air travel, as the world economy slowly starts to recover.

887	HUMANISING AUTONOMY LTD	HUMANISING AUTONOMY LTD	None	None	None	Measuring Impact of Social Distancing on Transportation (MISDT)	Social distancing policies have been imposed in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Citizens are being advised to keep a two-metre distance on streets, at stations, within shops, and on public transportation. These recommendations are impacting public transport organisations in many ways. Organisations are becoming heavily reliant on their staff at stations and transport interchanges to maintain the health and safety of passengers and other users, this includes encouraging social distancing. Due to the current lack of appropriate monitoring measures to understand and analyse passengers' behaviours and movements, staff are encountering difficulties in ensuring the safe use of public facilities, both in real-time and to proactively deliver effective interventions at high-risk locations. Humanising Autonomy (HA) and Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) are proposing a collaboration to improve the safety for all users of public transport interchanges. By deploying HA's behaviour video analysis software, staff will be able to easily detect the following: adherence to social distancing, number of people and those in groups, directional movement, use of infrastructure and behaviour analysis (seated/standing/walking/exercising, etc.). This could help inform TfGM's response and recovery strategies (e.g. the reallocation of departure stands & loading bays, the laying out of social distancing information). Data can also be used to better understand capacity for walking and cycling, in order to complement other data streams (Smart Junctions, Counts, surveys, etc.).

888	TOUCH FANTASTIC LIMITED	TOUCH FANTASTIC LIMITED	None	None	None	Live interactive online classes for schools	Schools are facing unprecedented challenges in education provision during Covid-19 lockdown. Our vision is to provide them with a cutting-edge, easy-to-use, technical solution to deliver excellent remote teaching which will enhance continuity of education during the current lockdown and future restrictions on face-to-face contact. It will also permanently provide valuable new methods of education delivery beyond Covid-19 conditions. Specifically, this project is for the creation of a video and audio system for delivering live interactive online educational classes which are safe, secure, and appropriate for a classroom context. Many schools are currently experimenting with existing video conferencing software. There are numerous reasons why no existing software is fit-for-purpose for delivering online lessons in a school context, including potential for: * malicious attacks/access to lessons (as in recent press reports e.g. BBC 10/04/20, Sky News 10/04/20, TES 02/04/20 & 03/04/20, Guardian 02/04/20) * unsupervised video communication between children and teachers/malicious actors * lack of data security including out-of-EU transfers breaching GDPR * accidental/intentional user broadcast of inappropriate images (e.g. inappropriate attire or background) * amplification of socio-economic/home-life inequalities in students' video backgrounds * conference management controls not appropriate for school lessons context Providing a genuinely context-appropriate solution designed specifically for schools will revolutionise delivery of remote education in this country. We are already delivering a partial solution -- Sparkjar -- our world-leading, teacher-student communication and workflow platform, providing ground-breaking, timesaving and communication-enhancing tools. It is fully implemented in testbed schools and we have pre-existing, exciting and realistic plans to roll-out at scale. Sparkjar was designed for standard teaching conditions, but is already adding great value for testbed schools during lockdown, improving communication with students, resource sharing, and setting and marking assignments. What it cannot currently provide is a platform for full delivery of live interactive online lessons. This project is to add that functionality in the form of a new Sparkjar Smart Classes system which will take Sparkjar from being a world-leading solution for face-to-face education, to also being so for the delivery of fully online lessons.

889	EDGE DIGITAL MANUFACTURING LIMITED	EDGE DIGITAL MANUFACTURING LIMITED	None	None	None	Online tools for targeted and rapid digital upskilling	Covid-19 is impacting the manufacturing sector in a number of ways: * Health and Safety requirements to comply with social distancing measures * Increased remote working * Requirement to access core data remotely * Changes in customer demand and disruption to supply chains * Staffing pressures due to illness and self-isolation Manufacturers can benefit from digital technologies helping them access and optimise core data and production data remotely. Processes can be improved to facilitate remote working and team collaboration. However, many manufacturers have previously been reluctant to implement digital technologies and a key barrier has been the level of digital skills and confidence within an older workforce. Many employees are also impacted by shielding measures and use of furloughing and there will be a need to help them prepare to use digital technologies in the future. This project will develop an affordable and scalable solution to help manufacturers overcome employee driven barriers to digitisation and adopt new technologies quickly and effectively through targeted upskilling, on-demand support to achieve rapid cultural change and employee feedback monitoring to address concerns and improve confidence. The project aligns with the priorities of the Manufacturing Made Smarter Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund Wave 3 Challenge. Key elements within this project will include:  * Validating an end-to-end process for improving digital confidence for employees in the manufacturing sector  * Developing interactive wire-frames and a prototype application to support this process  * Testing this process and the prototype application with a cohort of manufacturing employees  * Analysing data captured to further develop our understanding of employee barriers to digital adoption Employees will receive a personalised digital readiness assessment and ongoing training and mentoring support to improve their digital confidence. We will capture employee feedback throughout the project and use this to tailor the training provided. EDGE Digital has provided digital strategy and planning support to hundreds of manufacturers through events, seminars, workshops, webinars, coaching and mentoring.

We propose to develop realtime 3D simulation-based eTraining apps for ICU Ventilation and Temporary Cardiac Pacing accessible on mobile devices. The UK Health Secretary has recently confirmed that 4,500 retired healthcare workers have signed up to help battle the outbreak. The NHS will soon have access to nearly 10,000 new Intensive Care Units. As a result large numbers of doctors and nurses of all specialties are currently being diverted to ICU management. At the same time young and inexperienced staff are being deployed in the newly added ICU's in existing and new hospitals, such as the NHS Nightingale in London, Manchester, Harrogate, etc. Mechanical ventilation and temporary cardiac pacing are the two procedures with the most critical interventions in ICU for COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Evidently there is a sharp increase in demand for rapid clinical training for these ICU procedures.

However, the ability of Iodine to inhibit viral and associated opportunistic infections may prevent or reduce some of the debilitating symptoms of COVID-19 and other viral infections. Until now, oral use of Iodine has been limited as iodine in alcohol-based preparations taste very unpleasant and can cause pain, skin irritation & staining and are often religiously unacceptable. At the heart of this proposal is an opportunity to facilitate oral cavity application of iodine to treat infections quickly and cheaply using a novel and effective water based suspension technology.

Our primary concern at this time of great uncertainty is the health and well being of those in our most vulnerable communities. Prisoners can no longer receive visitors, support from outside organisations have been curtailed, prisoner movements have been severely reduced and prison officer numbers are reduced due to self-isolation. This has an adverse impact on prisoner education, mental health and wellbeing and put the prison system under increased stress. Coracle is delighted to have been awarded a grant from Innovate UK to help tackle the issues of isolation that are acutely seen within the prison estate and are grateful for the opportunity to be able to support HMPPS with the roll out of our innovative, patent pending "Coracle Inside" technology that allows prisoners access to in-cell digital education, without breaching security or allowing access to the internet. Coracle has been working over the last three years with HMPPS and the Ministry of Justice to get approval for the technology. The system was developed, working closely with Learning Together -- the network of 31 universities, led by the University of Cambridge's criminology department, that enables prison residents to study alongside university students. James Tweed, founder of Coracle Inside said. "It's a well-researched fact that prisoners who engage in education are less likely to reoffend. Covid-19 has impacted prisoners access to education. One problem is any form of internet access is forbidden in prison. This severely restricts access to course materials and the digital tools that most of us take for granted, especially for those that are vulnerable or self-isolating. Coracle Inside laptops are issued to prisoners for use in their cells whilst ensuring 100% separation from the internet or any other devices. We allow syncing through patent pending Coracle Inside Hub, installed in a location with supervised access. The system has passed rigorous Ministry of Justice security testing and can be used to assist learners with any kind of course whether academic, vocational or self-improvement. We also support health, mental health and wellbeing programs. Our focus is now twofold -- firstly to demonstrate the system to prison governors, prison education managers and heads of reoffending and rehabilitation and secondly to work with organisations that support prisons in improving learning, skills development, mental health and wellbeing so their materials can be delivered digitally in cell."

Applications include: (i) a portable personal achievement record, to be used as a point in the cloud from which a learner can interact (and communicate) with learning providers and transition between them, and into employment, sharing trustworthy qualification data at each step; (ii) sharing of proof of identity held by one bank to another to open a new account, or to DWP when claiming Universal Credit; (iii) sharing of a 'key-worker' credential, to be used to claim priority in the booking of a slot for home delivery of groceries; and (iv) the sharing of a covid-19 immunity certificate from a test lab to an employer (should society decided to follow that route). Note there are quicker ways to achieve (iii) and (iv): this is an infrastructure project to address a broad class of applications, not a quick fix.

As organisations served predominantly by volunteers, these organisations are understaffed and are unable to meet this demand. This not only impinges on staff fatigue but also results in increased waiting times resulting in inefficiencies. This is representative of many non-profit organisations across the UK and beyond. It is this problem that we wish to solve by using Conversational AI Chatbots. Large volumes of information which is dynamic in nature due to constant changes in law and guidance, means that standard rule based Chatbots won't be a practical solution. Our Chatbot will use a hybrid approach of configured rules for forms or slot filling, combined with machine learnt stories from content. Our solution will evolve with training and be more effective in answering complex user queries.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	48632.0 GBP

Dedicated to medical education, Oslr, having already built a digital health platform for student doctor training, being piloted at leading UK teaching hospitals and are primed to rapidly innovate a training platform to accelerate the training of Social Care workers. Unlike current methods used to arrange training such as emails, rotas, calendars and _Whatsapp_, an Accelerated Social Care Worker Training Platform would be dedicated to to meet Social Care sector training requirements, filtering and backing up online training with essential on the ground instruction. Designed for both web and mobile, the platform would allow for Social Care training requirements to be quickly gathered and arranged, specific to staffing level, location and training categories for example assisting and moving people during isolation for care and support workers at individual care homes. Training sessions plus feedback and attendance would be automatically logged to allow training gaps at specific Social Care staffing levels, locations and training categories to be quickly identified, alongside promoting best practice and group engaged learning, benefiting dedicated care workers, their cared for and ultimately all of us during this national and global time of challenge.

It's become clear to us immediately in the wake of the Covid-19 lockdown that there is a potential to innovate something in this area as none of the existing well known platforms offer this combination of sevices. Opportunities for musicians to rehearse, develop ideas and stream performances when colleagues are in multiple locations are currently limited by latency, audio quality issues and access to specialist knowledge. We will develop a web platform and prototype a raspberry pi (Single Board Computer) based system with built in microphone, sound-card and web connectivity to allow instant access to our communication infrastructure. Not having access to a quality home recording setup or relevant technical knowledge is a barrier for many. We believe this project will enable amateur and professional musicians alike to be able to collaborate remotely in real time and create studio quality recordings.

898	TRIBOSONICS LTD	TRIBOSONICS LTD	None	None	None	Novel Measurement Technology to Transform the Plastics Industry	Tribosonics is an innovation-led company located and forged in Sheffield, United Kingdom. It drives transformation by using its unique ultrasonic sensing technologies to address challenges in tribological contacts (wear, friction and lubrication). Using its unique Technology Stack, it provides data of unmatched information density at an embedded component level with core measurement competencies in stress, lubricant film thickness, wear, fluid properties, contact pressure and non-destructive testing. Tribosonics have developed a polymer equipment monitoring system using their ultrasonic measurement technology for measuring wear in polymer processing equipment. The polymer industry faced significant disruption during 2019 due to concerns about plastics pollution. This disruption, however, has been dwarfed by the widespread disruption brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. Every point in the supply chain has felt the impact. Production via labour intensive and poorly digitised processes for some polymer-based products has come to a halt (e.g. plastic equipment and automotive parts). On the other hand, production of plastic packaging and medical plastics has been booming in these times of intense pressure on supply chains, but not in a way that is sustainable or environmentally acceptable. This project is to develop novel embedded, real-time sensor technology for the polymer processing industry to promote sustainable plastic packaging and the circular economy, to improve productivity through automation and remote monitoring by digitising the industry and accelerating the adoption of the "Industrial Internet of Things." Our vision will manifest itself in a more productive and responsible polymer processing industry that is sustainable both in times of crisis and post-crisis when normality returns.

The virus is like a spy in the body, being silent for weeks and then suddenly triggering an air raid alarm. Such overreaction leads to lung damage and death. We believe that managing immune system response is critical for tackling the disease, particularly in elderly patients. There are a variety of pharmaceutical and natural/alternative solutions for the immune system, but the medicines give you very little control and can have severe side effects, while natural remedies are modestly effective at best. Wouldn't it be great if we could control the immune system at a touch of a button and save lives by careful personalised monitoring and management of the immune response as the disease progresses? At BrainPatch we are a team of scientists and experienced entrepreneurs backed by world-class expert advisors. Our aim is to develop a platform technology of safe and effective brain stimulation for a range of applications. We know that the immune system can be driven by the nervous system and that we believe we can deliver a tool to stimulate specific parts of the nervous system system to help regulate the immune response of COVID-19 patients at a touch of a button. This project aims to bring the company closer to putting this solution in the hands of doctors on the front lines and in intensive care units and that it would help prevent deterioration of lungs and death saving hundreds of lives each day.

904	Hannah Lambie-Mumford	University of Sheffield	None	None	None	Meeting food vulnerability needs during COVID-19: applying a systems approach to evidence based policy and practice	Working with national governments across the UK – including Defra’s Food Vulnerability Directorate, the Scottish and Welsh governments and the Food Standards Agency, this project will apply a systems approach to enable understanding and monitoring of the array of activities to enhance or provide food access to vulnerable people during the COVID-19 outbreak, including both financial and direct access. Reflecting Defra’s Food Vulnerability focus, target groups include people with low incomes, shielded individuals, and the ‘nonshielded vulnerable’. The aims of this project are to: • Undertake comprehensive mapping of the food access systems, highlighting key areas of vulnerability within them and identifying links to other support systems. • Using a case study approach, develop and apply methods for monitoring and evaluating the food access for vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 outbreak and through the easement of lockdown restrictions. • Develop ‘exit strategies’ for managing the transition out of systems that will not be provided after the crisis. • Establish ‘best practice’ protocols for resiliency planning for the future. The project methods include collaborative systems mapping, local area case studies (collating qualitative and quantitative data) and in-depth interviews with system users and other key actors. The project will provide policymakers with a comprehensive overview of food access activities for vulnerable groups and identification of key gaps and weaknesses within this system, informed by stakeholders who use these systems and those contributing to them. Civil society and business communities benefit by directly informing this work, but also from its evaluative and monitoring components, enabling them to identify and refine their efforts in the wider context.

By combining this with baseline data collected from previous waves of the UKHLS we will be able to identify who has felt the deepest and the longest-lasting impact on their financial situation and their mental health from the Covid-19 pandemic, and how these two impacts are related. Data collected in April 2020 – when the pandemic was at its initial height in the UK – will allow us to identify the groups that were particularly badly hit by the initial shock to the UK economy and social distancing measures intrdouced. Multilevel models will be used to identify the significant factors in explaining poor mental health and poor economic circumstances at the height of the pandemic in the UK as well as to identify groups at particular high risk. Subsequent monthly data will allow us to identify the rate and extent of the recovery of high risk groups. By modelling individuals’ personal characteristics and socioeconomic situation (including their exposure to schemes aimed at mitigating economic shocks) as well as their mental health and economic situation at each time point, we will be able to identify what personal factors and external interventions are associated with a fuller or quicker recovery, and which individuals remain vulnerable and require additional help to recover.

907	Kevin Wyche	University of Brighton	None	None	None	The Hidden Rise in Toxic Air Pollution during the COVID-19 Pandemic: is our response worsening the respiratory burden of particulate matter in the UK?	Recent research has highlighted the concerning paradigm that reducing ambient concentrations of legislated air pollution, in the form of PM2.5, may lead to a decline in air quality by increasing the concentration of more harmful ultrafine particles (UFP; diameter less than 100nm). It has been shown that PM2.5 plays a crucial role in suppression of UFP numbers, with larger PM2.5 particles acting to scavenge the more toxic UFP from the air. Consequently, removal of PM2.5 as a UFP sink may result in enhanced ambient UFP numbers, particularly if UFP emissions and gaseous precursor concentrations remain unchecked. With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, anthropogenic activity around the globe has decreased in a vast and unprecedented manner, to such an extent that concentrations of commonly measured primary air pollutants have decreased dramatically. However, levels of secondary pollutants (which often correlate with finest UFP fractions) have already begun to rise. It follows that this sudden, global drop in anthropogenic activity and ambient PM2.5 has the potential to drive an unexpected and potentially significant increase in UFP concentrations and associated detrimental health effects. If we are now inadvertently adding an unlooked-for cardio-respiratory pollutant into the air at a time when many are vulnerable to a virus that impacts the respiratory system, we risk widening the COVID-19 'window of vulnerability', where increased UFP exposure acts to exacerbate underlying conditions for individuals with pre-existing co-morbidities, who may otherwise be considered 'lower risk', and worsen the impact of the virus for those already considered as 'at risk'.

908	Simon Proud	University of Oxford	None	None	None	COVID 19 - Reduced Air Traffic due to Coronavirus, Environmental Impacts	The aviation industry is responsible for at least 5% human climate impact, despite producing only 2.5% of CO2 emissions. A key driver of this is contrails, which have a particularly large effect by trapping heat in the troposphere. However, their impact is poorly understood due to difficulties in studying contrails, especially for situations where contrails spread out into large, long-lived, cirrus clouds. The unprecedented reduction in aviation due to the pandemic allows us to isolate and track individual contrails using satellite data, which is usually very challenging. The relatively clear skies during the pandemic also enable us to much better estimate the impact of aviation by comparing airspace and contrail formation during the shutdown against normal conditions. Furthermore, as the pandemic subsides there is a unique and urgent opportunity for the UK government to support aviation in an economically and environmentally friendly manner - especially in the context of controversial decisions such as Heathrow's third runway. This project will use unique data sources to conduct cutting-edge research into aviation's environmental impact, contrails in particular, to allow the government to make evidence-based decisions on financial and regulatory support to the industry as it returns to flight operations in the future.

909	Matthew Rigby	University of Bristol	None	None	None	COVID-19: Rapid detection of the impact of COVID-19 on UK greenhouse gas emissions	The nationwide restrictions on social interaction brought about by the COVID-19 outbreak have the potential to dramatically change the UK's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, given the lack of precedent, it is difficult to predict the sign, magnitude, or spatial and temporal change that may occur. Atmospheric GHG observations are sensitive to emissions changes over very short timescales (hours to days), and therefore "top-down" (atmospheric data-based) inference of GHG emissions has the potential to provide rapid updates to climate researchers, the public and stakeholders (e.g. BEIS and the UK's GHG inventory compilers). There have already been reports of reductions in atmospheric concentrations of GHGs and air pollutants in the media from across the world. However, these reports have sometimes lacked scientific rigour, ignoring the critical influence of meteorology and seasonality. Here, we aim to use data from the UK's unique GHG measurement network (the UK DECC network) and adapt our atmospheric modelling and statistical inference frameworks to provide robust information on any rapid changes in UK GHG emissions that occur during the period of COVID-19-related restrictions. Conversely, the change in anthropogenic activity provides an unprecedented opportunity to test top-down (atmospheric data-based) emissions inference frameworks, such as those used to report UK GHG emissions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project. It seems highly likely that SARS-CoV-2 will cause disease and mortality unprecedented in modern times. Despite rapid publication of data from China, many unanswered questions remain that have immediate bearing on control and treatment of COVID-19: • Pathogen: how does transmission occur and over what period? What features of the virus drive transmission and severity? • Host: How can diagnosis be improved? How can severity be predicted? Does prior immunity to other viruses worsen disease severity? How does (non)pulmonary organ injury occur? Can therapy be tailored according to disease mechanisms? Which bacterial or fungal co-infections contribute to critical illness? This is a new disease. There is a high chance that clinical trials will fail to detect therapeutic effects, by enrolling at the wrong time, or missing key subgroups or endpoints. Deep biological phenotyping can mitigate these risks, providing rapid, efficient clinical evidence. Our response has been planned and tested over the past 8 years within the International Severe Acute Respiratory Infection Consortium (ISARIC). We will recruit at least the first 1300 consenting UK patients, and 1000 suspected cases, as the base of a coordinated national response, using our established, internationally-harmonized protocol (ISARIC Clinical Characterisation Protocol) to: • Provide a unified foundation for clinical trials, enriching design and interpretation • Provide an open-access platform for evaluation of diagnostics and therapeutics • Establish a sample repository with independently-managed availability to researchers and to industry. • Use real-time data to inform the response by funders, public health and hospitals ISARIC-4C is a consortium of experts with a proven track record of high-quality outbreak research.

916	ASEPTIKA LIMITED	ASEPTIKA LIMITED	None	None	None	Deployment of Active+me for remote patient support and cardiac rehabilitation for vulnerable patients in isolation, following heart surgery.	Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, recovery after heart surgery was optimised by engaging the patient in a rehabilitation process, arranged in stages: * Phase I at the bedside after the procedure. * Phase II as an out-patient * Phase III as a series of exercise workouts and lifestyle education classes over 6-8 weeks (conducted by nurses and/or physiotherapists). Some Phase III classes were in hospitals, others in leisure centres. * Patients were then referred to Phase IV classes, usually in leisure centres. These are supervised by Personal Health Coaches (PHCs) trained to high standards by the British Association for Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation (BACPR). Completing a Phase III programme has proven health benefits and is mandated by NICE. Even though the Phase III classes were free, only 50% of eligible patients enrolled. The National Audit of Cardiac Rehabilitation found that women, people from low-income backgrounds and those from ethnic groups were less likely to join these life-changing programmes. Due to the pandemic, all face-to-face rehabilitation processes have ceased. Front-line care-staff have been diverted to support the treatment of patients with Covid-19 and there is no spare capacity for patients recovering from heart surgery or a heart procedure. Active+me can significantly enhance recovery of these vulnerable patients, who will otherwise have minimal support during their self-isolation. Active+me will provide remote and self-monitoring, remote education delivery, remote exercise classes and virtual chat rooms. Following a heart procedure, Active+me will support patients who are vulnerable, currently self-isolated and often have multiple medical conditions. While the risk of a second heart attack is only 10%, the risks from other conditions affecting the health of the patient is high (50%). Active+me addresses the major challenge of replacing face-to-face rehabilitation programmes with a novel "activation" service which is delivered remotely, includes a remote monitoring service, delivers a sense of community and achieves this whilst releasing NHS staff to front-line duties. 121,500 patients in the UK each year are eligible for Cardiac Rehabilitation. Women, ethnic groups, patients on low-incomes and those in rural settings have not been fully engaged. Active+me can now be delivered remotely, applying "the six pillars of self-care" developed by Aseptika: 1. Education; 2. Physical exercise (cardiovascular/muscle strengthening/balance); 3. Tools to self-monitor symptoms/physiological signs with "light-touch" remote monitoring; 4. Medication adherence; 5. Learning triggers, and 6. Long-term behaviour change supported by family, peers and non-medical mentors ("light touch" Behaviour Change Theory). Funding from Innovate UK is required to support roll-out of Active+me.

It delivers exceptional results at low concentration levels. Our novel coating for hard or flexible surfaces and textiles meets the urgent need for Personal Protective Equipment and clothing for clinical and medical settings. This project will demonstrate coated textiles and garments which are intrinsically safe and re-useable. They will also be capable of production in the UK, using readily available textile machinery and industrial or domestic sewing machines. Much of the Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) currently used in clinical-medical environments is made from paper and plastic microfibres, blown or felted into tight meshes designed to block particles. Even the best FFP3 masks (costing <£4-each) do not block individual particles of viruses like Covid-19, they must be disposed of between patients and when moist (in FFP3 masks, about 2 hours).High tech fabric and graphene coatings are now coming to market, Graphene coated textiles can block virus particles and last longer, however production processes are costly and coatings degrade quickly. Even the best new masks can only be washed and safely re-used 3 to 6 times. Clearly the ideal for surgical clothing is a highly protective, safe, washable, re-useable solution which offers mask level protection, yet making gowns and surgical clothing with such textiles is currently prohibitively costly.Graphene coated textiles are extremely durable - earlier versions of our coating are found in expensive sportswear for extreme environments. Our coating can block virus particles 10x smaller than the best existing PPE. By preventing liquid penetration to its base layer, our textile remains useable for longer periods during sessional-use. Between patients, masks using our textile can be sprayed with Hydrus75 (a highly effective, low cost disinfectant product we already supply to the NHS) for immediate re-use, or washed and dried for re-use later the same day. It can even be zapped with electricity to disinfect it. Our re-useable PPE also has a positive environmental impact, greatly reduce the quantities required, whilst at and relieving supply issues.; In China alone 192k-tonnes of used surgical masks are disposed of annually, from clinical settings alone. This toxic waste is either incinerated, or inappropriately landfilled.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	49933.0 GBP
919	FUTURE HEALTH WORKS LTD	FUTURE HEALTH WORKS LTD	None	None	None	Leveraging Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision to Deliver Surgery at Scale in a Post-COVID-19 World	COVID-19 has placed our healthcare services under extraordinary pressure. The decision to prioritise hospital capacity for COVID-19 and cancel planned surgery, to free up crucial resources, is the only option under these circumstances. However, this decision will have lasting consequences for both our society and healthcare system; 2.1+ million patients have had their surgery canceled, ([The Independent, 2020][0]), 33% of which are orthopaedic surgery (Royal College of Surgeons). With waiting lists already long (British Orthopaedic Association, 2020), these new, added cancellations will create an unprecedented burden, lasting years beyond the outbreak of COVID-19, with Patients potentially waiting years for treatment, with limited access to the support they need. When surgery returns, healthcare providers will need to continue to protect the "at risk age group" from COVID 19, avoiding unnecessary hospital appointments, and keeping inpatient admissions to a minimum. Technology can support the increased scale at which hospitals deliver orthopaedic surgery, freeing up healthcare professionals' time and reducing the cost of care. The introduction of remote monitoring can keep vulnerable patients safe, facilitate day case surgery and reduce complications and in-person appointments. Accurate clinical assessment of joint function (range of motion) is a key component to monitoring orthopaedic patients. This assessment supports decisions from rehabilitation to progress with recovery. Traditionally this assessment is delivered in-person by either a surgeon or physical therapist using a goniometer. We have developed technology using computer vision AI that can be remotely accessed through a smartphone camera. This independently-validated technology can provide clinical teams with the information they need to carry out assessments of joint function remotely. We propose to productise this technology through our mature, established digital orthopaedic patient engagement platform, that is already deployed within leading orthopaedic centres in the UK (NHS & Private), to deliver an end-to-end solution to remotely manage patients and enable widespread adoption. This proprietary, first-of-a-kind technology will provide immediate benefits to patients who are currently awaiting surgery without an operation date, whilst supporting healthcare providers deliver orthopaedic surgery at greater scale and protecting at-risk patients from COVID-19 .

This is also true for COVID-19, where early detection would result in a significantly improved patient prognosis. AINOSTICS' technology represents a breakthrough that would provide an automated, extensible, and personalised healthcare platform for assisting the clinical diagnosis and management of patients suffering from COVID-19, using multi-modal clinical imaging and non-imaging data; useful for both the treatment of patients, and importantly, in the development of novel therapeutics. We intend for AINOSTICS' software to become a routine part of clinical practice and drug development as the results of our intelligent analysis will provide clinicians, researchers, and imaging centres a convenient and cost-effective means to get reliable, quantitative and objective diagnostic data. For serious global diseases, AINOSTICS' technology has the potential to save time during patient assessments, accelerate clinical pathways, standardise the quality of care and improve patient outcomes, in addition to making important contributions to the development of disease modifying therapeutics.

922	OCASTA STUDIOS LIMITED	OCASTA STUDIOS LIMITED	None	None	None	Remote clinical teaching technology for all UK medical schools	The Covid-19 pandemic has interrupted undergraduate medical teaching dramatically, by stopping classroom sessions and the ability of students to work in hospitals to gain clinical experience. **This has the potential to stop new doctors completing their training and so depriving the NHS of valuable staff at a time of unprecedented healthcare need.** To help answer this urgent issue the UK medical schools under coordination by the Medical Schools Council have come together to adopt the CAPSULE clinical learning platform to support remote learning (https://info.capsule.ac.uk). CAPSULE has been developed by the Brighton & Sussex Medical School and Ocasta, a leading eLearning solutions provider. CAPSULE is unique as it contains over 650 clinical cases with 3,500 questions, including medicine, surgery, paediatrics, psychiatry, therapeutics, obstetrics and gynaecology, general practice and professional studies. All content is supported by an editorial board of senior clinicians from all specialities, there is a rolling process of core review, case editing and selective case additions - maintaining active and relevant content. CAPSULE has been in use since 2016 in a small number of UK medical schools, however, the pandemic has spurred collaboration across the sector has allowed the educational content on CAPSULE to be updated and enhanced to support a faster, wider deployment. The project funded by the innovation grant will allow the platform to be further established as a learning tool, with capabilities to advance remote teaching facilities, to support better student progress tracking with tailored teach and to promote research into the effectiveness of remote teaching practices. Through this funding, CAPSULE will become an industry-proven platform to support an increasing industry move to remote, self-paced learning, supported by teaching sessions to cement understanding. This will lead to opportunities across other overseas territories for CAPSULE and a technology platform better able to be adapted for other market sectors and industry verticals.

923	LIGHTRICITY LIMITED	LIGHTRICITY LIMITED	None	None	None	Self-powered (mantenance-free) wireless asset-tracking and monitoring system for hospitals, healthcare and logistics	As evidenced in the Covid-19 pandemic, it is crucial that nurses and doctors' time is productively spent on patient care rather than wasted on finding missing equipment such as pumps, ventilators, beds, wheelchairs, blood pressure and ECG monitors. Studies have shown that medical staff can spend up to two hours-per-work shift searching for equipment. Multiple industry sources estimate that between 10% and 20% of hospital inventory is stolen or lost each year. Current solutions for tracking of assets in hospitals are based on battery-operated RFID or Bluetooth technologies. Such Real-Time Location System (RTLS) can show equipment location data. However, they suffer a large total Cost-of-Ownership (due to limited device lifetime and significant maintenance required), a lack of device interoperability and modularity (no possibility to easily upgrade the system). There is thus still reluctance within healthcare to deploy asset tracking solutions, despite the potential to save both money and lives. Installation expenses can indeed be high if the solution is not compatible with the hospital's already-existing network infrastructure and regulations. Operational costs will be also prohibitive if medical staff have to replace batteries in thousands of IoT devices. In this project, Lightricity (Oxford-based SME, spun-out from SHARP Labs) will focus on reducing overall cost-of-ownership by developing a completely autonomous (self-powered with indoor Photovoltaic cells) and modular wireless hardware solution for asset tracking and monitoring. Lightricity will demonstrate a standards-based systems which can support interoperability features with existing IoT cloud software and network infrastructures. The objectives of this project will be focussed on the development of 2 key demonstrators: * A prototype of self-powered indoor asset tracking device with general purpose real-time tracking capability. * An advanced self-powered indoor wireless monitoring device for detection of asset movements and monitoring of sensitive equipment. In the future, the developed technology will also find applicability in patient monitoring and tracing for the fight of spreading infections in hospitals and care-homes, transportation, and supply-chain management (logistics and retail).

To flatten the curve and reduce deaths, governments have released guidance for general public focused on social distancing and hygiene behaviours. However, a standardised strategy to educate young people has not been established. Our pilot research has indicated that young people feel invincible against coronavirus, with only 17% of participants believing they will catch coronavirus and 35% believing they would catch it, but it would not make them ill. However, 10% reported concerns over "when it would be over". To this end, there is an urgent need to develop accessible resources for young people to ensure that government guidance is followed, and anxiety is alleviated. To meet this need, the project team aim to develop a mobile game to educate young people on COVID-19 . The video game will be developed on Unity game engine for mobile devices, allowing widespread uptake and dissemination. Backend game analytics will be used to map player knowledge gaps and attitudes towards COVID-19 . These data will be used to assess effectiveness of game and in combination with government data, to better understand barriers to government guidance, and social impacts of COVID-19 .

Severe pneumonia is the most common cause of death from COVID-19, but there are currently no known effective treatments for COVID-19. In conjunction with our international collaborators, we will add the assessment of some drugs with potential antiviral activity (lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine) and treatments that modulate the body’s immune response (anakinra and interferon beta 1a), which in severe cases is thought to further damage the lungs. This study has a special adaptive design which allows the results from around the world to be analysed as frequently as every week, which are then used to immediately increase the proportion of participants who are allocated the treatments more likely to be effective. Assessment of other potential treatments can also be added quickly in the future.	Health Research Council of New Zealand	Research Grant	169571.0 NZD

928	Paul Johnson	IFS	None	None	None	Supporting fiscal policy decisions in the crisis	We are going through an economic crisis. The government has responded with an unprecedented policy package, costing many tens of billions of pounds over just a few months – paying for employees to be furloughed, making payments to the self-employed, forgiving business rates, increasing public service spending and making the benefit system much more generous. Over the coming year, the government will have to decide whether to do more to insure households’ incomes and prevent business failure, whether to use fiscal policy to kickstart the economy as the health crisis subsides and, ultimately, how to unwind these measures or whether to make some of them permanent. To guide these momentous decisions we propose targeted new analysis of new data sources, including a soon-to-be-available covid-19 module in a large-scale longitudinal household survey and real-time bank account data from a budgeting app. Combined with IFS’ world-leading expertise on tax and benefit policy design and unrivalled familiarity with the institutional and policy context around the UK’s labour market, taxes and benefits and the public finances, will inform how fiscal policies should be adjusted in the coming 12 months. We are having regular discussions and seminars with civil servants and policy advisors at the top of government through this crisis. The new work proposed here would feed in to this engagement directly, allowing us to help policy-makers take difficult decisions in this highly unusual and fastmoving economic environment, including through taking advantage of novel and timely data sources to produce the best possible empirical evidence.

929	Thomas Kirchmaier	London School of Economics & Pol Sci	None	None	None	COVID-19: Outreach to Domestic Abuse Victims in Times of Quarantine	Police reports suggest that domestic abuse (DA) has risen as a result of the pandemic, yet there is concern that the share of DA incidents reported may have fallen. When a victim and abuser are quarantined together, calling the police may jeopardize the victim's safety. As a result, greater numbers of victims are increasingly isolated and at risk. So how can victims get help? How can authorities let them know what options are available? Direct messaging can be dangerous, since texts from the police may provoke a controlling abuser. We propose a targeted social media campaign to inform potential high-risk victims about the Silent Solution, a safer option for contacting police. Our approach leverages the wide use of social media, which also poses less risk than direct messaging. Whereas text messages are actively sent, social media adverts are passively received. The study will identify potential high-risk victims and randomly select half for the media campaign. Analysis of DA calls will show whether the approach is effective. If so, it will provide an approach for reaching isolated DA victims, and for giving them options to get help, that will be of value both during quarantine and beyond.

930	Nayeli Gonzalez-Gomez	Oxford Brookes University	None	None	None	The effects of social distancing policies on children’s language development, sleep and executive functions.	The environments children grow up in heavily influence key elements of cognitive development such as language and executive functions, which in turn associate with later educational and occupational attainment as well as health and wellbeing (1–8). The COVID-19 pandemic is a unique, once-in-a-lifetime situation that has dramatically changed the daily lives of millions of families. Several environmental factors likely to be affected by quarantine measures (such as sleep (9–17), parenting style and social interactions (18–22), screen use (23–27), and outdoor activities/exercise (28)) are known predictors of language and executive function development. The proposed study will follow up a UK-wide cohort of 600 children aged 8 to 36 months of age, enrolled in an online study at the onset of social distancing measures, to capture changes in key environmental variables and measure their impact on children’s vocabulary size and executive function. Using sophisticated analyses on a large and diverse sample, we will examine the role of each factor on children’s cognitive abilities. At this time of unforeseen and ongoing change, it is imperative to understand the impacts of the lockdown on cognition during a critical period for development (0 to 3 years of age), and then find strategies to minimise disruption to this cohort. Our findings will identify approaches that mitigate the temporary loss of formal early years’ education, identify those groups most at risk of adverse consequences, and inform policy on how to remediate the negative impacts of lockdown post-COVID-19.

931	Jon Burchell	University of Sheffield	None	None	None	How to understand, scale and maximise the effectiveness of volunteer responses to COVID-19.	COVID-19 necessitates ‘self-isolation and social distancing’ to ‘keep people safe’. This requires radically different ways of meeting essential needs in food supply, healthcare and wellbeing. At the same time, existing needs such as food poverty, homelessness and unemployment have been exacerbated. The UK government has mobilised a new army of volunteers on an unprecedented scale to meet these needs (Gov.UK, 2020). This offers a potentially huge resource to the Voluntary and Community Sector (VCS) and to Local Authorities (LAs), however, it also presents significant challenges around how to deploy and optimize volunteer support. This proposed project will address the knowledge gap around what community resource mobilisation, infrastructural support and capacity building is required to organise the scale and pace of volunteering needed in a restricted environment, and share good practice to maximise responses to COVID-19. It will do so by enabling the nationwide sharing of innovations and good practices between LAs and VCS organisations charged with managing volunteer responses. It will collate, distil and disseminate the learning from organisations (national, local and micro), creating a national picture of what strategies are being utilised and corresponding stress points. The research team draws on its significant experience of volunteering and of working in partnership with LAs and VCS organisations through the Enabling Social Action Programme (ESA) (2018-2020), which we run for the department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). The trusted cross-sectoral relationships and experiences of sharing practices and learning embedded in ESA provides a framework for this project.

Despite more than 1 Mio. documented infections worldwide, a profound lack of knowledge impedes clinical management and the development of therapies. COVID-19-associated pneumonia and lung injury differ in relevant details from any of the known types of pneumonia that cause respiratory failure, including viral infections like influenza or MERS-CoV. It is unclear whether specific decision guidelines established for pneumonia are applicable or whether these need to be refined for COVID-19. The PROVID consortium thus aims to characterize the host- and virus-dependent mechanisms associated with clinical appearance of COVID-19 to improve patient care through advances in risk stratification and clinical management. We will test the hypotheses that i) host factors (transcriptional response, proteins, antibodies) determine the severity and/or course of COVID-19, ii) molecular and clinical determinants of COVID-19 differ from those previously deciphered in other types of pneumonia and they can be used as molecular predictors for disease progression, iii) specific molecular markers of disease severity can be tested as therapeutic targets for COVID-19, iv) stabilization of barrier function - in addition to antivirals and immunomodulators - may present a third pillar for effective therapy.

It offers high sensitivity, short turnaround times and wide availability, and may thus complement RT-PCR tests, especially in situations of unclear clinical presentation, such as a negative RT-PCR despite strong anamnestic evidence for COVID-19. More importantly, it may offer opportunities to directly assess the stage of progression of the disease as observed directly from the affected lung tissue, and may thus be a method of choice for therapy response assessment in upcoming trials of new therapeutic agents. However, in order to develop it into a suitable tool for these purposes, a reproducible, standardized, and quantitative approach to image diagnostics is required. This proposal aims to develop such a standardized diagnostic and staging procedure for COVID-19 cases, using an AI-supported approach to select clinical attributes that serve as optimal predictors of the presence and stage of the disease.

This is not restricted to the phase of insufficient availability of resources during the pandemic, but has to be considered during all phases of the pandemic progression: 0) regular treatment before the pandemic; 1) prevention of the spread and preparation for infected individuals; 2) resource scarcity, and 3) of re-establishment of regular treatment routines. The complexity of cancer care requires specific considerations of ethical and medico-legal aspects during the pandemic, but currently such guidelines are only available for intensive/ emergency care. The proposed project aims to develop data-based decisional guidelines for oncology care under the context of pandemics. Stakeholder perspectives will be assessed by specific questionnaires. Clinical data from various sources (clinical cancer registry, claims data), data regarding oncology-specific critical resource availability during pandemic and selected economic data will be used for modelling consequences in terms of morbidity development, and disease-related outcomes. Based on our findings, a comprehensive evaluation of ethical and medico-legal aspects will lead to the development of a checklist for the management of oncology care during the pandemic and to the development of guidelines for this type of decision making under these critical conditions.

Our approach includes editing an anthology of 30 poets (15 UK / 15 other countries) responding to COVID-19, and an accompanying interactive website enabling collective public participation/engagement with poetry. CI and PI will situate poetry as a mode of response to COVID-19 in a multi-format essay speaking to our contemporary moment and within the context of other historical poetries of crisis (published in a peer-review journal, and also the anthology/website). The website (edited by PI/CI) will mitigate distancing and isolating effects of lockdown, inviting people to engage in forum discussions of COVID-19-related poetic performances and Q&A sessions. It will also provide a curated platform for public-submitted poetry responding to COVID-19. Target audiences include those suffering bereavement, physical or mental health issues, and those in need of 'wellbeing' (in line with the long-published research regarding the therapeutic value of reading and/or 'reflexive' writing of poetry). The print book (published 01/2021) formulates an immediate, static artistic response to COVID-19. The website will be edited for 12 months from the contract's proposed start (06/2020), enabling dynamic ongoing responses, exploring the impact of the virus as it requires ever-changing modes of engagement. The website further proposes value in its legacy-archiving and its exemplary use of digital technologies, enabling discourse (in this case, poetry) to be freely accessible during this crisis and future lockdowns.

The benefits system therefore faces two significant challenges: (1) Urgently, to provide timely income and support to claimants. The wave of new applications places stresses on DWP processes (e.g. ID verification), exacerbating pre-existing concerns over the five-week wait for payment and the shift to a digitalised benefits system. Navigating this 'virtual' system often depends on in-person help (from e.g. advice agencies) and the extent to which claimants can access support remotely is unknown. (2) Later, helping claimants quickly return-to-work, whilst maintaining security for those out-of-work. Not only do 'new' claimants differ from existing claimants, but they are entering an altered system, with higher payments and reductions in conditionality/employment support. However, there is little knowledge about these new claimants, the operation of the 'new' system or the 'exit strategy' that follows. There is no time to waste; initial payments to the cohort of new applications are due late-April and major changes in the operation of the benefits system are likely to occur shortly after social distancing ends/relaxes. As such, this 18 month project will provide large-scale evidence on how well we are meeting these challenges and where the system is struggling in order to help policy makers and practitioners to develop rapid solutions. To provide this vital evidence, we will use the following methods: (1) Surveying claimants We will conduct an online survey of 8,000 new and existing claimants. We will start this within three weeks of commencing the project and go back to these people twice over the during of the project. (2) Case studies of claimant support We will also speak to the people who provide support to claimants. Using case studies of Leeds, Newham, Salford and Thanet, we will conduct 8-12 interviews (48 in total) with people providing this support (e.g. local authority, voluntary organisations, Jobcentres). (3) Interviewing claimants We will also carry out in-depth interviews with 80 claimants. These individuals will be interviewed twice (160 interviews in total) starting our first interviews in May. Participants will be recruited from both our survey and case study areas to ensure we include a diverse range of experiences.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	524782.0 GBP

It offers high sensitivity, short turnaround times and wide availability, and may thus complement RT-PCR tests, especially in situations of unclear clinical presentation, such as a negative RT-PCR despite strong anamnestic evidence for COVID-19. More importantly, it may offer opportunities to directly assess the stage of progression of the disease as observed directly from the affected lung tissue, and may thus be a method of choice for therapy response assessment in upcoming trials of new therapeutic agents. However, in order to develop it into a suitable tool for these purposes, a reproducible, standardized, and quantitative approach to image diagnostics is required. This proposal aims to develop such a standardized diagnostic and staging procedure for COVID-19 cases, using an AI-supported approach to select clinical attributes that serve as optimal predictors of the presence and stage of the disease.

This is not restricted to the phase of insufficient availability of resources during the pandemic, but has to be considered during all phases of the pandemic progression: 0) regular treatment before the pandemic; 1) prevention of the spread and preparation for infected individuals; 2) resource scarcity, and 3) of re-establishment of regular treatment routines. The complexity of cancer care requires specific considerations of ethical and medico-legal aspects during the pandemic, but currently such guidelines are only available for intensive/ emergency care. The proposed project aims to develop data-based decisional guidelines for oncology care under the context of pandemics. Stakeholder perspectives will be assessed by specific questionnaires. Clinical data from various sources (clinical cancer registry, claims data), data regarding oncology-specific critical resource availability during pandemic and selected economic data will be used for modelling consequences in terms of morbidity development, and disease-related outcomes. Based on our findings, a comprehensive evaluation of ethical and medico-legal aspects will lead to the development of a checklist for the management of oncology care during the pandemic and to the development of guidelines for this type of decision making under these critical conditions.

Our approach includes editing an anthology of 30 poets (15 UK / 15 other countries) responding to COVID-19, and an accompanying interactive website enabling collective public participation/engagement with poetry. CI and PI will situate poetry as a mode of response to COVID-19 in a multi-format essay speaking to our contemporary moment and within the context of other historical poetries of crisis (published in a peer-review journal, and also the anthology/website). The website (edited by PI/CI) will mitigate distancing and isolating effects of lockdown, inviting people to engage in forum discussions of COVID-19-related poetic performances and Q&A sessions. It will also provide a curated platform for public-submitted poetry responding to COVID-19. Target audiences include those suffering bereavement, physical or mental health issues, and those in need of 'wellbeing' (in line with the long-published research regarding the therapeutic value of reading and/or 'reflexive' writing of poetry). The print book (published 01/2021) formulates an immediate, static artistic response to COVID-19. The website will be edited for 12 months from the contract's proposed start (06/2020), enabling dynamic ongoing responses, exploring the impact of the virus as it requires ever-changing modes of engagement. The website further proposes value in its legacy-archiving and its exemplary use of digital technologies, enabling discourse (in this case, poetry) to be freely accessible during this crisis and future lockdowns.

The benefits system therefore faces two significant challenges: (1) Urgently, to provide timely income and support to claimants. The wave of new applications places stresses on DWP processes (e.g. ID verification), exacerbating pre-existing concerns over the five-week wait for payment and the shift to a digitalised benefits system. Navigating this 'virtual' system often depends on in-person help (from e.g. advice agencies) and the extent to which claimants can access support remotely is unknown. (2) Later, helping claimants quickly return-to-work, whilst maintaining security for those out-of-work. Not only do 'new' claimants differ from existing claimants, but they are entering an altered system, with higher payments and reductions in conditionality/employment support. However, there is little knowledge about these new claimants, the operation of the 'new' system or the 'exit strategy' that follows. There is no time to waste; initial payments to the cohort of new applications are due late-April and major changes in the operation of the benefits system are likely to occur shortly after social distancing ends/relaxes. As such, this 18 month project will provide large-scale evidence on how well we are meeting these challenges and where the system is struggling in order to help policy makers and practitioners to develop rapid solutions. To provide this vital evidence, we will use the following methods: (1) Surveying claimants We will conduct an online survey of 8,000 new and existing claimants. We will start this within three weeks of commencing the project and go back to these people twice over the during of the project. (2) Case studies of claimant support We will also speak to the people who provide support to claimants. Using case studies of Leeds, Newham, Salford and Thanet, we will conduct 8-12 interviews (48 in total) with people providing this support (e.g. local authority, voluntary organisations, Jobcentres). (3) Interviewing claimants We will also carry out in-depth interviews with 80 claimants. These individuals will be interviewed twice (160 interviews in total) starting our first interviews in May. Participants will be recruited from both our survey and case study areas to ensure we include a diverse range of experiences.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	524782.0 GBP

Police case file data from seven diverse police forces are pooled to track the impact of the pandemic on DA, analysing changes in the risk factors, frequency, nature and profile of DA reported to police. These changes are mapped closely to shifts in the restrictions imposed during lockdown, transitional phases and post lockdown, when DA calls to police are expected to spike. The proposed study is the largest and most rigorous analysis of police DA case file data conducted anywhere in the world to date. The statistical analysis is complemented by regular focused semi-structured phone interviews with police officers, to identify emerging challenges and best practice in the frontline response to DA. The mixed-methods study addresses urgent questions on the impact of Covid-19 on DA, which may have significant implications for the complex task of accurate police risk assessment, victim safeguarding, and criminal prosecution as the Covid-19 pandemic evolves. The Home Office, the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC), and College of Policing (CoP) are project partners and constitute direct links to critical decision-makers and provide direct routes to impact. A timely and evidence-based development of a police strategy is urgently needed to address the emerging DA crisis and its devastating, longlasting consequences for victims and their children.

As the report states: “Social distancing is making delivering services harder and more costly. Reserves are running out. Smaller charities, in particular, are at risk of imminent closure”. The core ideas for this project emerged through dialogue with DCMS, who are leading the government’s response on how COVID-19 is impacting the sector, and co-designed with NCVO, the sector’s leading infrastructure organisation. The project has three purposes. First, to provide realtime data and learning on how COVID-19 is impacting the whole sector and, significantly, varies across different organisations by size, structure and services offered. Second, to provide lessonslearned reports about how organisations on the impacts and responses to COVID-19, particularly focusing on the new working-practices and innovations which can be scaled across the UK. Third, to provide insights to aid long-term the VCSE sector’s resilience. The project team brings a unique alignment of researchers specialising in the VCSE sector, HR and innovation, NCVO, who provide sector knowledge, guidance and access, through their research and policy team and 15,000 members. The outputs are a VCSE vulnerability barometer, providing real-time data of the impact COVID-19 on the sector, lessons-learned reports, enabling innovations to be scaled, a final project report and toolkit for resilience.

Added family stresses, including income loss, excessive confinement, social isolation and anxieties about health and education heighten pressure and volatility within the home. Children are among the most vulnerable in society. Changes to the home environment, where families are now spending virtually all of their time, are unprecedented. Children are increasingly reliant on digital devices, opportunities for physical activity have greatly diminished and the home-food environment has been impacted by disruptions to availability and accessibility. Collecting information on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the home environment, and the consequences for children's physical and mental health is an immediate priority. The Gemini study is an established nationally representative twin birth cohort which has been collecting detailed information about the twins and their families for the past 13 years. Gemini offers a unique opportunity because in the five months prior to U.K. 'lockdown', the study collected detailed information on the food, physical activity and media environments within the home, along with measures of health behaviours and psychological wellbeing. This timely and comprehensive baseline data can be combined with extensive information collected during the COVID-19 crisis and its aftermath, enabling rapid characterisation of the impact of the pandemic on the family environment and child health. The immediate insights gained from this study will inform evidence-based guidance for how best to respond to the current pandemic to mitigate negative impacts for families, while simultaneously shaping policies to promote child health and wellbeing should future waves of infection emerge.

975	IS-INSTRUMENTS LIMITED	IS-INSTRUMENTS LIMITED	None	None	None	FLuorescent Imaging of Critical Cleanliness Areas – FLICCA	A major issue occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic is a global shortage in Personal Protection Equipment (PPE). This has mostly been due to the sudden nature of the onset and rapid progression to pandemic status, coupled with a supply chain prepared to accommodate the requirements for industry and healthcare, rather than mass public panic buying. There are several solutions to this global shortage going forwards; increase the supply chain, but this must be sustainable, produce different products for the mass market or make better use of the available PPE, either through re-use or better understanding of how often PPE needs replacing. The latter also helps combat another global threat, climate change, by reducing waste and encouraging increased re-use. Whilst front line healthcare professionals obviously require appropriate PPE to ensure their own and their patient's safety, accurately assessing the state of certain PPE could make a substantial difference to the availability as a whole. Whilst close contact PPE, such as gloves, must obviously be changed with extreme regularity, the guidance is less proscribed for other forms of PPE, such as face shields or reusable respirators. Here the advice is clear, but only qualitative (e.g. damaged, soiled, difficult to use). If the state of in-use PPE could be assessed quickly and reliably, waste could be reduced and contamination further minimised. Current CDC guidelines state it is preferable to use PPE beyond its lifetime rather than go without. Similarly, simple cleaning procedures may be sufficient to allow continued use of PPE that would previously have been discarded. We propose to assess the feasibility of producing a simple device based on fluorescent imaging to measure the state of in-use PPE and PPE after simple cleaning processes that could be carried out in a healthcare setting. We further propose that the same technology could be used to assess the cleanliness of in-situ equipment/facilities after decontamination (e.g. monitors, beds). This device could also have applications in the food production industry to ensure that food preparation areas and packaging produces no onward contamination through the food supply chain.

976	GREENSPUR RENEWABLES LIMITED	GREENSPUR RENEWABLES LIMITED	None	None	None	Feasibility Study for a Multi-MW Ferrite Based Permanent Magnet Generator for Wind Turbines	Covid-19 has shown that global wind supply chains are vulnerable to significant disruption. This is particularly relevant to the supply of critical raw materials, such as rare-earth magnets, which are used in multi-MW wind turbines. The current crisis has highlighted the need for the UK to develop its own wind energy supply chain and UK-based key component production. In addition, the UK government has made its low carbon ambitions very clear. It plans to deploy 40GW of offshore wind by 2030 and to be carbon-zero by 2050 . These goals have certainly become much harder to achieve as a result of the international disruption caused by Covid-19 . GreenSpur Wind, a 100% subsidiary of Time To Act Limited, has invented and patented a new and highly innovative Permanent Magnet Generator (PMG), which can form part of the UK's response to the problems caused by Covid-19 . The Company's PMG substitutes scarce and expensive rare earth magnets (£45/kg) for cheap and highly abundant ferrite magnets (£1/kg). The global wind turbine market requires large rare-earth magnet volumes, which are sourced almost exclusively from China ( >80%). In addition, supply chain shortages are forecast from the mid-2020s onwards (Roskill). GreenSpur's innovation will enable its UK based engineering and manufacturing partners to help the UK wind sector reduce and very possibly eliminate it heightened exposure to a risky and volatile global supply chain. GreenSpur's long-term vision is to stimulate the development of the UK's wind energy supply chain and manufacturing network so that new multi-MW generators can be built in the UK to meet the country's future needs. This project will build on the three successful machines built by GreenSpur, with the most recent a 250kW generator tested at the Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult in Blyth (August 2019). This testing proved the accuracy of the Company's computer models, giving strong confidence they can be used to design, rare-earth free, multi-MW generator configurations. This project will focus on improving GreenSpur's modelling tools and feed into a feasibility study for the design of a multi-MW generator for the UK onshore wind turbine market. This will support commercial conversations with potential co-development partners enabling GreenSpur to submit a strong grant application into the future Driving the Electric Revolution challenge funding call.

The critical shortage of such Face Filtering Respirators (FFR) is likely to worsen until a vaccine for Covid-19 is found. Vending machines for face masks are starting to be deployed in China, Poland, Thailand and Turkey to name a few. The Mundus-UV project will provide the capacity to disinfect face masks in a few minutes, and more importantly to safely re-use the up to 10 times, enabling huge savings for citizens looking for optimal protection in every day life. The positive impacts for its users will be: - Peace of mind: Better individual protection and at affordable prices. - No counterfeits: Vending machines will deliver only certified N95 respirators for initial purchase. - Reduced reliance on imports from other countries (e.g. China, US). - Scalability: Our 'decontamination as a service' business model approach will ensure that organisations implementing it will only incur operational expenses (Opex) rather than capital expenditures (Capex) - reduced pressure on local government procurement services in times of budget strain, as our approach will lead to dramatically reduced up front cost. - Environmental impact: Bringing confidence back for re-usable cups: in March 2020 Starbucks banned the use of re-usable cups because of Covid-19 pandemic. The accompanying mobile app will: - Enable users to order/buy certified N95 respirators for delivery and pick-up at lockers. - Keep track of the frequency and number of times the masks have been disinfected. - Provide advice wrt mask fitting to reduce leaking and minimize droplet/particle penetration.

978	HANGER19 LTD	HANGER19 LTD	None	None	None	Guaranteed Reliability and Availability of Chargers in Emergencies (GRACE)	The electric vehicle (EV) revolution is gathering pace with more fleets, especially public sector, transitioning to EVs. Transport was highlighted as an essential pillar of the Covid19 response, with vehicles essential for providing healthcare and delivery services. While petrol stations are established, the EV charging sector is still immature and challenges remain. There is still insufficient charging infrastructure for the growing need and reliability of charging infrastructure still remains an issue. During the Covid-19 issues, there were multiple times when chargepoints failed to operate for essential service sites and required intervention to resolve the issue. To support these essential services, it was necessary to send a person to site in order to fix the chargepoint. This further highlights an issue known throughout the industry - the time taken to resolve charging point faults is too long. This is largely because a disproportionate number of faults require an engineer visit, even if it is an internal chargepoint software issue or hard reboot required. A better solution is required to reduce this need and fix more faults remotely. GRACE will develop an innovative hardware module that can be installed into existing chargepoints that allows remote access to resolve issues and the same level of access that is achieved through a site visit. This will reduce the number of engineer visits and increase the speed of issue resolution. This will significantly increase the uptime of chargers and provide a more reliable service for key worker sites. This will be backed by a software and service layer to enable a higher level of support 24/7 .	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	46066.0 GBP
979	SATAVIA LTD	SATAVIA LTD	None	None	None	Aviation Industry COVID-19 Recovery	The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is estimating that the COVID-19 pandemic will cost the airline industry more than $314 billion, reducing revenues by 48% in 2020, as a result of travel restrictions and their aftermath (IATA COVID?19 Updated Impact Assessment, 14 April 2020). In April 2020, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) reported that scheduled flights in the UK were down by 89% and the cost of lost airline revenue in the second half of 2020 may be close to $16 billion. Overall GDP in the UK will be reduced as a result of COVID-19 by 6.5% in 2020, at a cost close to $200 billion. The total impact on European airline revenue will be a 55% reduction in Revenue Passenger Kilometres (both international and domestic) for the full year 2020, at a cost of $89 billion (ICAO document: Effects of Novel Coronavirus (COVID?19) on Civil Aviation: Economic Impact Analysis, 15 April 2020). The vision of the project is to analyse the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic and predict the recovery of the aviation industry. The project initially involves modelling the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic and then will develop a 'return to service' model for the commercial aircraft fleet, region by region. SATAVIA has supported the Ventilator Challenge UK project (www.ventilatorchallengeuk.com) to provide data analytics on estimated ventilator numbers. The SATAVIA data science team has developed capability to predict ventilator number requirements based on modelling of the progression of the pandemic. Several of the data science team previously have epidemiological backgrounds which enabled us to quickly develop an analytical grade model. We intend to extend SATAVIA's current 'envirotech' software platform to include epidemiological analysis capability. Key objectives will be to: (1) Integrate COVID-19 forecasting methodology with confidence intervals, test using historic data, and validate the predictions; model how the progression of COVID-19 cases correlate with climatic conditions and policy interventions, and the use this to understand options for air travel to resume. The main focus of the enhanced capability will offer a near-real-time analysis of industry recovery as travel restrictions are released to predict commercial flight activity into 2021 . The project is highly innovative as it brings together a diverse and highly capable data science team, and extends SATAVIA's software technology to aggregate a diverse range of data sources spanning epidemiological to atmosphere and climate analysis, for an industry that is a critical part of the global economy.

981	EMTEQ LIMITED	EMTEQ LIMITED	None	None	None	Front Line Access to Multi-sensory E-PTSD (FLAME) Digital Therapies to improve mental health	There is a high emotional cost of treating multiple severely ill patients, triaging those to save, whilst working under severe resource constraints. Health care workers are engaged in a prolonged battle against a deadly, highly contagious illness with no known cure. Following the 2003 SARS outbreak, many health care workers reported high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms, which had long-term psychological implications. Similarly, frontline healthcare workers directly involved in care of patients with COVID-19 are at risk of developing mental health symptoms including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).? PTSD is caused by witnessing or experiencing actual or threatened death, serious injury or violence. It causes tremendous suffering, is difficult to treat under normal circumstances, and is even more difficult to treat under pandemic situations. A cross-sectional research study published in March 2020 found that of 1257 health care workers managing Covid-19 in 34 hospitals, 50.4% reported symptoms of depression, 44.6% symptoms of anxiety, 34% insomnia, and 71.5% reported distress.? Past research shows that over a **third** of front line responders experience symptoms of PTSD. It affects the individual (depression), their family (strained relationships), their colleagues (loss of effectiveness), the hospital (reduced resources) and has an economic cost. Employers have an obligation to protect their employees from known threats to their physical and mental well being. Sadly, diagnostic practices for mental illnesses are poorly implemented and patient stratification is almost non- existent in the NHS. NHS-approved therapies for PTSD include cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), and more recently Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR). These are difficult to deliver and suboptimal via telemedicine, which reinforces the importance of prevention Studies have supported the use of virtual reality for anxiety disorders including PTSD as it allows both the assessment of fear responses, and resilience training. However, traditionally-delivered VR therapy needs a therapist in the room to monitor the patient and ensure that there do not become overwhelmed.? As pandemic circumstances preclude therapists from travelling to hospitals, our EmteqVR solution provides the best of both worlds: real-time sensing of emotional responses to negate the need for a therapist to be in the same room, and a range of graded life-like exposures without the need to travel. For this project, our app will allow earlier warning of when users are experiencing stress. Later this will be integrated into our VR therapy platform.

Food banks offer invaluable local community services: providing food aid; acting as a conduit to other local community services; advising on possible benefit entitlement and crucially offering the human touch -- the ability to sit and have a cup of tea, to talk and be heard. All of these services social and mental health of those in the community who need the help of food banks. Yet when they are needed most, social distancing and shocks to the economy places a huge strain on food banks. Many local donation points, such as those at places of worship or in shops have been closed. Donation points at supermarkets are unavailable or used by those in desperation. Monetary donations have limited utility when the purchasing of tinned food is limited to ensure fair access. The uncertainty in the volume of donations received in turn limits a food bank's ability to assess how many food aid packages they will be able to provide in any given week, at a time when the need is increasing. This project will use data science forecasting and predictive modelling techniques, to enable food banks to more accurately assess predicted demand from the local community alongside expected supply of donations. Using this, the food banks will be able to make informed requests to their supporters for specific shortage items before stock becomes critical; work with other food aid organisations in their area to ensure breadth of supplies. The overall result will be to: reduce the volatility in donations received; increase capacity for the food banks to support local families; raise awareness of the food banks in the local community and crucially reduce the planning time for volunteers at food banks so they have more time for the critical human aspects of food banks -- a listening ear by someone who understands and wants to help	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	36000.0 GBP

As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, even those fortunate enough to have secured placements will never see those placements fulfilled. For all of these students, this represents a major setback in their career development and it has the potential to widen an already significant gap for those young people from more disadvantaged backgrounds. Our proposal to create a Digital Work Experience Platform ("DWEP") will help address this issue, providing large numbers of students from all backgrounds with access to a structured programme, co-created with and supported by employers. Different to online employer encounters, the DWEP will focus more on replicating crucial outcomes typically achieved through on-site placements. Key features of the DWEP will therefore include simulated work-based tasks, independent research, reflective learning and assessment, pastoral input from academic tutors and employer feedback. By building the DWEP on the existing Start platform ([www.startprofile.com)][0] - already used by thousands of schools, colleges and employers in the UK and internationally - it will be accessible, sustainable and scalable, benefitting hundreds of thousands of students for years to come in addition to those impacted now by Covid-19 . The DWEP will blend the existing Start technology with an industry-leading Learning Management System including secure video-conferencing and collaboration tools, ensuring that a stable and secure platform can be built and deployed quickly to meet this urgent need. To achieve our goal, we will collaborate with our extensive school, college and employer network to design and curate high quality digital work experience programmes for students. The result will be a flexible solution -- one which can be used by any school or college at a time to suit their timetable and students. It will also enable a wide range of employers - large and small - to engage with the programme, in both its design and delivery.

984	OUTFIELD TECHNOLOGIES LTD	OUTFIELD TECHNOLOGIES LTD	None	None	None	Securing the Apple Supply Chain – Using Aerial Imagery for Apple Count and Sizing for Managing Production, Labour and Logistics	COVID 19 has severely stressed orchard fruit supply chains as demand has risen, supply chains have faltered and international imports become uncertain. Growers this season are expecting labour shortfalls, or to use inexperienced local labour, and fruit is now of increasing importance. Growers currently manually collect limited data in a time consuming and inaccurate manner. To ensure food security in the UK, all of these issues must be addressed with better data and improved understanding of orchard conditions. This project, building on existing technology, will develop a system to provide accurate counts of the fruit in the orchard with a high degree of geospatial accuracy. This data is needed by growers to manage their orchards and to plan labour storage and logistics; and throughout the supply chain for managing supply, ensuring sufficient fruit is available and planning international trade. We have existing surveying and data systems operating in Kent orchards, and will be using existing techniques for identifying blossoms in tree fruit orchards. The approach proposed is unique in the global market -- using oblique (side on) imagery gathered above orchards with commercially available drones to count apples and forecast outputs. Several growers in Kent have expressed their support for this project, and we have permission from them use their datasets for this project. Moreover, growers have offered to provide thousands of trees' of hand counted ground truth data for this season to ensure the accuracy of the system developed. This innovation will help the UK tree fruit industry to supply the market and thrive in the disruption from COVID 19 . It can rapidly provide a readily implementable solution to support an industry that is critical in the UK. This will mitigate the pressure it has been put under by the COVID 19 virus and improve food security in the UK.

We consider ourselves Sustainability Fashionista and we have strong desire to address sustainability in the fashion industry. Our industry, in its current form, is unsustainable. It is the second biggest polluting industry - it is projected to use 25% of the world's carbon budget by 2050 . We are reaching out to clothing retailers to help them reduce the losses in income they face due to covid-19 . Clothing Retailers are expecting a 20% reduction in annual revenue with 80% considering their future highly uncertain. We also wish to help retailers reduce the costs from the return of clothing. UK Retailers loose £20B annually on returned clothing with more than 50% disposed of. Our project will develop a Hire Service Model to provide a fully managed Clothing Hire Service to Retailers including consultancy support for customisation and implementation. It also includes a Returns Service Model that refurbishes Retailer's returned clothes. The project provides us with a Circular Business Model that will minimise our impact on the environment and also create an Operational Excellence Model to make us the Global Centre of Expertise in Sustainable Clothing Hire. We also seek to develop a Talent Pipeline Model to recruit and develop local disadvantaged job seekers to help resource our expansion. This also includes tasks to improve the quality of working lives of all our staff. Lastly the project provides us with methods to compel our consumers to rent clothes. Our project positive impacts society, the economy and the environment. Our ideas and energy will be channeled into delivering pro-environmentally sustainable changes within our company and to Society as a whole. We will secure the jobs of our existing ACS staff employment and recruit many more from disadvantaged backgrounds. We will improve our staff and their family's health and well-being.

This will support the processors in the UK by reducing waste and assist our drink manufacturing business which has lost 60% of its turnover due to Covid-19 . Key objectives for this project are: 1 . Collaborating with our packaging supplier to develop an innovative shipping packaging solution for small, glass bottles for delivery by courier which is more environmentally sustainable, labour efficient and effective in delivering its contents safely that the current options. 2.Through our packaging supplier, make this innovative solution available to producers of other products in small glass bottles to improve their online delivery proposition. 3 . Launch an online platform to allow customers to purchase our drinks online and have them delivered by courier, diversifying our own route to market. 4 . Work closely with our ingredient suppliers to identify excess or waste produce to maximise their use in our soft drinks, therefore improving returns and efficiencies of UK fruit and herb processors. The main areas of focus for this project are two fold. Firstly, the development and successful launch of our ecommerce platform. Without this there would be no need to develop the second area of focus, a new shipping packaging solution for small glass bottles. Current shipping packaging options for small bottles are either to wrap each bottle individually in plastic bubble wrap or use cardboard dividers within the cardboard box. The first option is not environmentally sustainable and labour intensive and both options still produce breakages in transit, costing time and money. Our concept is to develop a cardboard die cut which holds each bottle within the cardboard shipping outer. It reduces the opportunity for bottles to become loose in transit and smash against each other and keeps bottles away from the edge of the box where they are also at risk of being smashed in transit. Our own research and our packaging supplier have not found anything like this on the market and will require their in house packaging innovation centre to develop the product.

990	BIOSTATUS LTD	BIOSTATUS LTD	None	None	None	Novel Cellular Probe Technologies for Screening Anti-Viral Therapeutic Candidates on Multiple Platforms	COVID-19 has demonstrated that emerging viruses are a major threat to human health. During rapidly spreading epidemics, infected individuals need to be treated urgently with antiviral treatments. The epidemic has further highlighted the need for rapid, effective screening of both novel and repurposed agents. Effective screening requires the utilisation of a variety of instrument platforms, the right cell types as the test system and the right molecular probes to track how a cell responds to a drug when confronted by viral attack. These probes can be antibody-based to identify specific targets or small molecules that can track how a cell responds to a viral attack and whether a new candidate drug can prevent the tissue damage - "cytopathogenic effects" (CPEs) - of viral infections and their linkage to disease progression. For the last 20 years, BioStatus has been inventing, developing and manufacturing innovative reagents for cell-based imaging, cytometry and screening applications. The company manufactures all products in the UK, and supplies customers and distributors worldwide to the ISO 9001:2015 quality standard. Our company is now bringing a focus to the challenge of screening of new drugs to treat emerging viral diseases and thereby contributing to reducing the health impact of infection. Our specific contribution is focused on the development and synthesis of novel small molecule probes and reagents for the drug screening communities in industry and academia, with the immediate goal of improving the quality of the information derived from screening assays. Our ultimate aim is to benefit patients in the health care system, by the provision of appropriately screened drug candidates for regulatory approval and clinical use in dealing with emerging virus threats.

991	SENSEUTICS LIMITED	SENSEUTICS LIMITED	None	None	None	Cytokine Storm Tracker	According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), around 15% of people infected with COVID-19 become seriously unwell and require oxygen therapy and a further 5% must be treated in intensive care. In the UK at present, less than 50% of those patients in Intensive Care Units (ICU) survive. In order to combat this shocking survival rate, we must deliver innovative new prognostic tools to ICU clinicians to enable them to treat patients earlier and with precision. The leading predictor of fatalities in ICUs is a patient's levels of particular pro-inflammatory cytokines. In sufficient levels the release of specific cytokines can cause a "cytokine storm", a fatal hyperinflammation in the body's vital organs as the immune system undergoes a secretory chain reaction. We are building a cytokine tracker to predict when COVID-19 infected ICU patients need life-saving therapies and stratify risk for the most vulnerable. By identifying cytokine levels hours faster and more regularly than any existing methods, we empower clinicians to make treatment decisions much earlier and more precisely based on each patient's immunological profile from the start.

992	SAY IT NOW LTD	SAY IT NOW LTD	None	None	None	Charity Donations Driven Via Voice Assistants	The charity sector is set to lose £4.2bn in funding directly linked to the Covid-19 pandemic. The impetus for individuals to donate needs to be stimulated by developing easily accessible channels. As of March 2020 34% of UK homes have a smart speaker and digital radio listening has increased 12% on these devices since the start of the pandemic. Our project will stimulate charitable donations via highly targeted smart radio adverts that allow the collection of donations using simple voice commands with existing payment methods. By combining in-market technologies we will create a simple flow for charities to use to drive donations. These start with a location and user targeted advert played on smart speakers streaming digital radio that, in turn, invites the listener to say a few words to open a bespoke voice experience that leads to a donation. Example: _"...People who are homeless are especially exposed to the coronavirus outbreak. But together we can get vital care and protection to them. To find out how just say 'Alexa, support crisis'"_ The listener is then guided into a rich and informative, voice led, experience that allows them to find out how they can support the charity and leads to a donation using existing Amazon Pay or Google Pay credentials. We will create specific templates that reduce the entry level cost of this approach, allowing many charities to avail themselves of this funding channel. We will be reporting specifically on return on investment and believe this will become an important fundraising channel both now and in years to come. Donating by Voice Assistant is not new, Driving smart speaker usage via targeted Audio Advertising is not new and reporting on a fundraising channel is not new. Bringing these all together with a focus on a platform that democratises access for all charities is where the innovation lies	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	47586.0 GBP
993	MOTION CONTROL PRODUCTS LIMITED	MOTION CONTROL PRODUCTS LIMITED	None	None	None	Remote motor control, configuration and management of shower pumps to enable IIoT control and in-turn minimise engineer visits.	In response to new social distancing normalities and in consideration of occupational safety, industries must respond by implementing measures to standardise social distancing in working environments. This is achieved by promoting changed practices such as home-working, and in line with this, greater remote systems control to minimise physical interaction and increase occupational safety. Today, the shower pump industry dispatches engineers to respond to unit faults that occur within warranty periods. Across the industry, this is around 12,000 visits per year. However, in over 50% of cases, it is found that the problem is not the responsibility of the pump engineer, rather there is an issue elsewhere in the water system such as trapped air or incorrect setting. A further 20% of cases are software issues that are resolved by an engineer connecting a diagnostics device to complete reprogramming. The final 30% of visits require replacement of parts or whole product which often require a parts order and return to the address at a later date. The 'SmartPump' innovation delivers Internet of Things (IoT) advantages to our existing pump motors by incorporating a GPRS 3G/4G/WIFI controller chip. Should a fault occur, an engineer is able to remotely complete a diagnostics check to identify faults and carry out remote programming if necessary. If further sensors are fitted to the pump, wider system diagnostics are also possible such as for pressure, temperature and flow. It is expected that the SmartPump diagnostics assessment functionality to reduce engineer visits by 50%+ by either: identifying whether the pump is fully operational; if the problem lies elsewhere in the water system; or if the motor requires a software update to resume normal operation. Potential for a reduction of 6,000+ engineer visits per annum across the entire industry is possible with SmartPump meaning a vast reduction in the potential exposure of Covid-19 . Further to this, the decreased downtime of shower pumps benefits the end-user as well as the reduced travel of the engineer lowers CO2 emissions production. In addition to the above engineer visits, there is an 8-10% return rate across the industry as "faulty product". However, with 60-70% of such returns, no faults are found. Diagnostic assessment would both minimise wastage of materials and reduce end-user returns. Having already developed a prototype, during the project we plan to: * Develop the firmware, electrics and software. * Create customer system integration interfaces and apps. * Commercially demonstrate the integrated motor.

These need to be addressed by diversity-sensitive concepts/policies. In the past weeks, providers of nursing, palliative and hospice care by necessity did develop approaches to adjust to a different reality. This study aims to examine these strategies, their perception by patients/relatives and to identify good practice approaches. Based on the findings and using a 6-step process of ethical decision-making, a handbook conceptualizing the determinants of good practice and providing recommendations on how challenges can be addressed will be developed. A mixed-method design is used. It comprises a scoping review of existing guidelines for nursing/palliative/hospice care (A), a document analysis of providers’ websites (B), qualitative telephone/video interviews with patients and their relatives (n=10-12) (C), an online survey of in-patient nursing, palliative and hospice facilities in Germany (N=15.677+653) (D), and 8-10 focus group discussions with staff of selected facilities (n=5-7 per group= 40-70) (E).

Disease behavior is variable, with the majority of patients experiencing only mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. Some patients develop severe pulmonary affection, with aggressive and extensive inflammatory destruction of lung parenchyma and associated systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and superinfections, driving large fractions of the COVID-19 related mortality. What exactly drives this development of severe lung disease remains unknown, but old age, smoking, obesity, diabetes and other co-morbidities increase the risk. Variation in virus genetics and patient immunology are also likely involved. As to the latter, we hypothesize that host genetics may play a role in determining development of severe lung disease in COVID-19 infection. We here aim to address the following research questions: (1) Are there genetic signatures suggesting which biological mechanisms are involved that may suggest relevant therapeutic approaches? (2) Can we predict those at risk (or those with very low risk)? (3) Are specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles/haplotypes associated with COVID19 disease? (4) Are blood groups of relevance in (a) the infection process and (b) in disease severity? Until today, no well-powered genetic analysis has been performed. To this end, we have collected 5,000 blood samples from some of the most strongest affected regions in Europe, including a significant fraction of severe COVID19 patients from intensive care units.

It offers high sensitivity, short turnaround times and wide availability, and may thus complement RT-PCR tests, especially in situations of unclear clinical presentation, such as a negative RT-PCR despite strong anamnestic evidence for COVID-19. More importantly, it may offer opportunities to directly assess the stage of progression of the disease as observed directly from the affected lung tissue, and may thus be a method of choice for therapy response assessment in upcoming trials of new therapeutic agents. However, in order to develop it into a suitable tool for these purposes, a reproducible, standardized, and quantitative approach to image diagnostics is required. This proposal aims to develop such a standardized diagnostic and staging procedure for COVID-19 cases, using an AI-supported approach to select clinical attributes that serve as optimal predictors of the presence and stage of the disease.

By building the DWEP on the existing Start platform ([www.startprofile.com)][0] - already used by thousands of schools, colleges and employers in the UK and internationally - it will be accessible, sustainable and scalable, benefitting hundreds of thousands of students for years to come in addition to those impacted now by Covid-19 . The DWEP will blend the existing Start technology with an industry-leading Learning Management System including secure video-conferencing and collaboration tools, ensuring that a stable and secure platform can be built and deployed quickly to meet this urgent need. To achieve our goal, we will collaborate with our extensive school, college and employer network to design and curate high quality digital work experience programmes for students. The result will be a flexible solution -- one which can be used by any school or college at a time to suit their timetable and students. It will also enable a wide range of employers - large and small - to engage with the programme, in both its design and delivery.

1001	OUTFIELD TECHNOLOGIES LTD	OUTFIELD TECHNOLOGIES LTD	None	None	None	Securing the Apple Supply Chain – Using Aerial Imagery for Apple Count and Sizing for Managing Production, Labour and Logistics	COVID 19 has severely stressed orchard fruit supply chains as demand has risen, supply chains have faltered and international imports become uncertain. Growers this season are expecting labour shortfalls, or to use inexperienced local labour, and fruit is now of increasing importance. Growers currently manually collect limited data in a time consuming and inaccurate manner. To ensure food security in the UK, all of these issues must be addressed with better data and improved understanding of orchard conditions. This project, building on existing technology, will develop a system to provide accurate counts of the fruit in the orchard with a high degree of geospatial accuracy. This data is needed by growers to manage their orchards and to plan labour storage and logistics; and throughout the supply chain for managing supply, ensuring sufficient fruit is available and planning international trade. We have existing surveying and data systems operating in Kent orchards, and will be using existing techniques for identifying blossoms in tree fruit orchards. The approach proposed is unique in the global market -- using oblique (side on) imagery gathered above orchards with commercially available drones to count apples and forecast outputs. Several growers in Kent have expressed their support for this project, and we have permission from them use their datasets for this project. Moreover, growers have offered to provide thousands of trees' of hand counted ground truth data for this season to ensure the accuracy of the system developed. This innovation will help the UK tree fruit industry to supply the market and thrive in the disruption from COVID 19 . It can rapidly provide a readily implementable solution to support an industry that is critical in the UK. This will mitigate the pressure it has been put under by the COVID 19 virus and improve food security in the UK.

1006	SUMMERHOUSE DRINKS LIMITED	SUMMERHOUSE DRINKS LIMITED	None	None	None	Increasing efficiency & sustainability in online retail glass packaging delivery	The overriding vision for this project is to develop more environmentally sustainable, more effective and labour efficient packaging for small glass bottles and employ them in a new ecommerce store for our soft drinks which can use lower quality fruit and herb ingredients from UK fruit & herb processors. This will support the processors in the UK by reducing waste and assist our drink manufacturing business which has lost 60% of its turnover due to Covid-19 . Key objectives for this project are: 1 . Collaborating with our packaging supplier to develop an innovative shipping packaging solution for small, glass bottles for delivery by courier which is more environmentally sustainable, labour efficient and effective in delivering its contents safely that the current options. 2.Through our packaging supplier, make this innovative solution available to producers of other products in small glass bottles to improve their online delivery proposition. 3 . Launch an online platform to allow customers to purchase our drinks online and have them delivered by courier, diversifying our own route to market. 4 . Work closely with our ingredient suppliers to identify excess or waste produce to maximise their use in our soft drinks, therefore improving returns and efficiencies of UK fruit and herb processors. The main areas of focus for this project are two fold. Firstly, the development and successful launch of our ecommerce platform. Without this there would be no need to develop the second area of focus, a new shipping packaging solution for small glass bottles. Current shipping packaging options for small bottles are either to wrap each bottle individually in plastic bubble wrap or use cardboard dividers within the cardboard box. The first option is not environmentally sustainable and labour intensive and both options still produce breakages in transit, costing time and money. Our concept is to develop a cardboard die cut which holds each bottle within the cardboard shipping outer. It reduces the opportunity for bottles to become loose in transit and smash against each other and keeps bottles away from the edge of the box where they are also at risk of being smashed in transit. Our own research and our packaging supplier have not found anything like this on the market and will require their in house packaging innovation centre to develop the product.

1007	BIOSTATUS LTD	BIOSTATUS LTD	None	None	None	Novel Cellular Probe Technologies for Screening Anti-Viral Therapeutic Candidates on Multiple Platforms	COVID-19 has demonstrated that emerging viruses are a major threat to human health. During rapidly spreading epidemics, infected individuals need to be treated urgently with antiviral treatments. The epidemic has further highlighted the need for rapid, effective screening of both novel and repurposed agents. Effective screening requires the utilisation of a variety of instrument platforms, the right cell types as the test system and the right molecular probes to track how a cell responds to a drug when confronted by viral attack. These probes can be antibody-based to identify specific targets or small molecules that can track how a cell responds to a viral attack and whether a new candidate drug can prevent the tissue damage - "cytopathogenic effects" (CPEs) - of viral infections and their linkage to disease progression. For the last 20 years, BioStatus has been inventing, developing and manufacturing innovative reagents for cell-based imaging, cytometry and screening applications. The company manufactures all products in the UK, and supplies customers and distributors worldwide to the ISO 9001:2015 quality standard. Our company is now bringing a focus to the challenge of screening of new drugs to treat emerging viral diseases and thereby contributing to reducing the health impact of infection. Our specific contribution is focused on the development and synthesis of novel small molecule probes and reagents for the drug screening communities in industry and academia, with the immediate goal of improving the quality of the information derived from screening assays. Our ultimate aim is to benefit patients in the health care system, by the provision of appropriately screened drug candidates for regulatory approval and clinical use in dealing with emerging virus threats.

1008	SENSEUTICS LIMITED	SENSEUTICS LIMITED	None	None	None	Cytokine Storm Tracker	According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), around 15% of people infected with COVID-19 become seriously unwell and require oxygen therapy and a further 5% must be treated in intensive care. In the UK at present, less than 50% of those patients in Intensive Care Units (ICU) survive. In order to combat this shocking survival rate, we must deliver innovative new prognostic tools to ICU clinicians to enable them to treat patients earlier and with precision. The leading predictor of fatalities in ICUs is a patient's levels of particular pro-inflammatory cytokines. In sufficient levels the release of specific cytokines can cause a "cytokine storm", a fatal hyperinflammation in the body's vital organs as the immune system undergoes a secretory chain reaction. We are building a cytokine tracker to predict when COVID-19 infected ICU patients need life-saving therapies and stratify risk for the most vulnerable. By identifying cytokine levels hours faster and more regularly than any existing methods, we empower clinicians to make treatment decisions much earlier and more precisely based on each patient's immunological profile from the start.

1009	SAY IT NOW LTD	SAY IT NOW LTD	None	None	None	Charity Donations Driven Via Voice Assistants	The charity sector is set to lose £4.2bn in funding directly linked to the Covid-19 pandemic. The impetus for individuals to donate needs to be stimulated by developing easily accessible channels. As of March 2020 34% of UK homes have a smart speaker and digital radio listening has increased 12% on these devices since the start of the pandemic. Our project will stimulate charitable donations via highly targeted smart radio adverts that allow the collection of donations using simple voice commands with existing payment methods. By combining in-market technologies we will create a simple flow for charities to use to drive donations. These start with a location and user targeted advert played on smart speakers streaming digital radio that, in turn, invites the listener to say a few words to open a bespoke voice experience that leads to a donation. Example: _"...People who are homeless are especially exposed to the coronavirus outbreak. But together we can get vital care and protection to them. To find out how just say 'Alexa, support crisis'"_ The listener is then guided into a rich and informative, voice led, experience that allows them to find out how they can support the charity and leads to a donation using existing Amazon Pay or Google Pay credentials. We will create specific templates that reduce the entry level cost of this approach, allowing many charities to avail themselves of this funding channel. We will be reporting specifically on return on investment and believe this will become an important fundraising channel both now and in years to come. Donating by Voice Assistant is not new, Driving smart speaker usage via targeted Audio Advertising is not new and reporting on a fundraising channel is not new. Bringing these all together with a focus on a platform that democratises access for all charities is where the innovation lies	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	47586.0 GBP
1010	MOTION CONTROL PRODUCTS LIMITED	MOTION CONTROL PRODUCTS LIMITED	None	None	None	Remote motor control, configuration and management of shower pumps to enable IIoT control and in-turn minimise engineer visits.	In response to new social distancing normalities and in consideration of occupational safety, industries must respond by implementing measures to standardise social distancing in working environments. This is achieved by promoting changed practices such as home-working, and in line with this, greater remote systems control to minimise physical interaction and increase occupational safety. Today, the shower pump industry dispatches engineers to respond to unit faults that occur within warranty periods. Across the industry, this is around 12,000 visits per year. However, in over 50% of cases, it is found that the problem is not the responsibility of the pump engineer, rather there is an issue elsewhere in the water system such as trapped air or incorrect setting. A further 20% of cases are software issues that are resolved by an engineer connecting a diagnostics device to complete reprogramming. The final 30% of visits require replacement of parts or whole product which often require a parts order and return to the address at a later date. The 'SmartPump' innovation delivers Internet of Things (IoT) advantages to our existing pump motors by incorporating a GPRS 3G/4G/WIFI controller chip. Should a fault occur, an engineer is able to remotely complete a diagnostics check to identify faults and carry out remote programming if necessary. If further sensors are fitted to the pump, wider system diagnostics are also possible such as for pressure, temperature and flow. It is expected that the SmartPump diagnostics assessment functionality to reduce engineer visits by 50%+ by either: identifying whether the pump is fully operational; if the problem lies elsewhere in the water system; or if the motor requires a software update to resume normal operation. Potential for a reduction of 6,000+ engineer visits per annum across the entire industry is possible with SmartPump meaning a vast reduction in the potential exposure of Covid-19 . Further to this, the decreased downtime of shower pumps benefits the end-user as well as the reduced travel of the engineer lowers CO2 emissions production. In addition to the above engineer visits, there is an 8-10% return rate across the industry as "faulty product". However, with 60-70% of such returns, no faults are found. Diagnostic assessment would both minimise wastage of materials and reduce end-user returns. Having already developed a prototype, during the project we plan to: * Develop the firmware, electrics and software. * Create customer system integration interfaces and apps. * Commercially demonstrate the integrated motor.

1012	Professor Owen Addison	King's College London	None	None	None	Enhancing facemask effectiveness during the COVID-19 pandemic through the development of personalised additively manufactured PPE	This project brings together digitial facial profiling with advanced additive manufacturing of medical grade silicones to improve the effectiveness of facemasks for key workers during the COVID-19 crisis. Customisation of FFP3 standard facemasks, whether generic or those being developed through alternative manufacturing routes to address the global supply shortage, is urgently required to (i) provide an effective seal protecting workers against viral transmission and (ii) enhance wearability to prevent skin trauma that is associated with prolonged use. In this project we will firstly assess the suitability of using smart phone based 3D imaging technologies to capture facial form and compare this data with clinically used photogrammetry. Simultaneously we will develop and assess a range of custom silicone interface prototypes that can be applied to existing FFP3 masks and newly developed designs. To achieve this we will use our existing expertise of 3D printing silicone to systematically optimise compositions tailored for this application exploring rheological and deposition variables. Our aim is to rapidly progress to mask 'fit' checking according to standard clinical procedures, evaluating for superiority in seal, comfort and reduced fitting time. Efficacy of viral disinfection of the additively manufactured silicone interfaces will also be assessed to facilitate translation. End-users will take an active part in the project, which itself will be supported by institutional research and development / commercialisation teams to maximise the chance of scale-up at the earliest timepoint.

This class of drugs in combination with a nucleoside analogue backbone (highly active antiretroviral therapy, HAART) had a huge impact on viral suppression and patient outcome. However, an important trade off was that the protease inhibitors were either the perpetrator or victim of multiple drug-drug interactions. The Liverpool University Drug Interactions group recognised the problem and began developing a web-based resource (www.hiv-druginteractions.org) which over the last 20 years has become very much the gold standard and is now recommended in over 30 international guidelines and many national guidelines. The website has an associated App. In 2011, direct acting antivirals were introduced to treat Hepatitis C and the Liverpool team responded with a new website (www.hep-druginteractions.org) and App. In 2019, these websites had over 50,000 unique monthly visitors searching for >4.5 million interactions. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to address the pressing need for prescribing support for studies and clinical situations where experimental COVID-19 therapies are being used, we have developed a static drug interactions website (www.covid19-druginteractions.org) providing information on the likelihood of interactions between the experimental agents and commonly prescribed co-medications. We now have to move to develop a fully interactive and searchable website resource with an associated App. The website will be constantly updated and populated with the latest information on experimental therapies as it emerges with guidance given to clinicians for managing complex patients.

There is limited evidence from population-based cohorts at scale across the UK or internationally that quantify within BAME group differences, or examine these in relation to modifiable risk factors. Aim: To describe the prevalence of confirmed COVID-19 cases by ethnic group in a large and representative sample of UK adults, and to quantify the association between ethnicity and mortality stratified by COVID-19 infection and modifiable clinical and social risk factors (blood pressure, HbA1c level, total cholesterol, Body Mass Index, smoking status, co-morbidities, medication use, domicile and household number). Methods: A cohort study of adults registered across three large national primary care databases in England, representing over 40% of the UK population. Participant sociodemographic, deprivation, clinical and domicile characteristics will be summarised and compared by higher level ethnic group (White, Black, Asian and Mixed Other) and their subgroups. For example, the Asian subgroup includes Pakistani, Indian, Bangladeshi or Chinese while the Black subgroup includes African or Carribean, as per the 2011 census. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for all-cause mortality and COVID-19 mortality, adjusted for potentially confounding factors will be calculated using Cox's proportional hazard regression. Implication: Our findings could provide rapid evidence on patterns of COVID-19 and associated mortality across and within ethnic groups in the UK. This has the potential to inform targeted mitigation public health strategies, and could alter clinical thresholds for at-risk patients presenting with the infection.

Annually, over 1,200,000 UK residents (pregnant women and neonates) need maternity care. All relevant authorities emphasise the critical importance of antenatal, intrapartum, postnatal and neonatal services, birth companionship, keeping mother/baby together, and breastfeeding, even during COVID-19. International disaster reports consistently value community provision. These principles align with NHS England Better Births safety and personalisation policies. UK maternity Trusts have responded differently to COVID-19. Some have reduced tests, contacts, community intrapartum provision, and birth companionship options. These decisions are associated with reports of unattended home births, delays in self-referral for unusual symptoms, and psychological distress. In other Trusts, and in countries such as The Netherlands, increased community care provision, and new innovations (including remote access to tests and contacts) are being trialled. With stakeholders, and using normalisation and behavioural change theories, we will identify which organisational responses have worked best for maternity care organisation during COVID-19. We will undertake policy level UK/Netherlands analyses, using official documents, national level interviews, and a geo-mapped on-line survey of women’s experiences before, during and after COVID-19. We will then undertake in-depth maternity/neonatal case studies in 8 UK Trusts, selected on available staffing levels at the crisis peak, and on case-mix. We will include retrospective and prospective documentary reviews, on-line staff and parent interviews, routine clinical outcomes data (including infections), and modelling of what worked to optimise safety and personalisation for women, parents, and staff. A final stakeholder event will co-develop a practical, theoretically informed organisational model for both routine and crisis-affected maternity and neonatal services.

Schools pose a major challenge due to features of their operation including the likelihood of cases being asymptomatic, the high number of contacts, the presence of vulnerable persons, and the potential for rapid onward transmission to family contacts of children and staff. These challenges must be weighed against the benefits to children including resuming their education, peer interaction and social development. A deeper understanding of infection history and dynamics and enhanced mitigation measures will have widespread benefit for outbreak control and future pandemic resilience. We will undertake a large-scale mapping study of prior and current COVID-19 infection in pupils and staff, including prospective testing over a 6-month period. This will dramatically enhance our understanding of infection patterns in this age group. Results will be mapped to home postcode location and linked to NHS system-wide data to highlight area-based and individual-level risk factors. We will also undertake weekly reactive testing in households with a confirmed, school-linked COVID-19 infection. To mitigate against infection transmission we will adapt evidence-based digital tools and co-create whole school implementation interventions to support positive infection control practices by staff, parents and pupils. We will co-design and develop a system to collate multiple sources of information to augment contact tracing and facilitate outbreak control. We will explore the impact of returning to school for staff and pupils' mental wellbeing, their attitudes towards actions taken to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, and potential interventions to address identified difficulties.

This unprecedented scale is needed for rapid results during Covid-19. OpenSAFELY uses a new model for efficiency and privacy: we have built a secure analytics platform inside the data centres where GP records already reside, and linked to all relevant Covid-19 outcomes data. This is not a proposal for theoretical future delivery. All permissions are signed, all data has flowed, our first analyses are complete. We have achieved this with no external resource. We urgently need funds to sustain, accelerate, and expand our work across diverse collaborative analyses. We can flexibly discuss priorities with UKRI, amend or remove work packages. This application covers the platform, and three workstreams: 1) Observational epidemiology to identify patients at higher risk of admission, ventilation and death from Covid-19, to inform management, seclusion advice, service planning, and underlying mechanisms (e.g. higher risk among BAME groups); to rapidly assess specific hypotheses arising around treatment/prevention including ACEi's, ARBs, ibuprofen, inhaled corticosteroids, anticoagulants, and other treatments. 2) Deliver innovative transmission models that combine disease-dynamics approaches with near-real-time hyperlocal clinical data on prevalence and population at risk, to predict local spread and service need, and (for example) to design and evaluate exit strategies from lockdown. 3) Measure and mitigate the indirect health impacts of Covid-19 on, for example, cancer presentations and referrals, cardiovascular management, vaccinations, etc, using research and observatory approaches to identify urgent necessary actions.

We will identify the key elements of testing systems that have contributed to effective performance, including measures taken that have facilitated preparedness and resilience before the crisis, as well as those rapid innovations that have helped countries to deal with a fast evolving pandemic. We will explain how testing systems have been used, and how challenges related to testing have been overcome. The research will include the four nations of the UK and five further countries. Additionally, the role of transnational organisations such as the WHO, EU and large diagnostics companies will be studied to understand how tensions have been managed between increasing the quantity of new tests for Covid-19 and maintaining their quality. The project will establish a UK research and knowledge exchange hub to will facilitate dialogue between the international research team and policy makers so that relevant questions are rapidly addressed and lessons are disseminated to policy makers and public audiences, in the UK, and beyond. In order to support COVID-19 responses deliverables will be shared from the early stages of this 12 month project. Additionally to inform preparations for future outbreaks, we will contribute to national and international fora seeking to learn lessons from the current crisis.

Digital certificates for verifying immunity, proof of vaccination and COVID-19 test results may contribute to the long-term COVID-19 management strategy, whereby based on their health status, certain individuals would be able to return to work and enjoy their general freedom of movement. Yet, such certificates pose important questions for the protection of data privacy and human rights, given that they would (1) use sensitive personal health information, (2) create a new distinction between individuals based on their health status, and (3) be used to determine the degree of freedoms and rights one may enjoy. The technologies adopted during the current pandemic will have a lasting impact on our societies. They will shape how we respond to the trade-offs between data privacy, human rights, and public health interests. This project will evaluate whether and how digital certificates for health status affect our enjoyment of data privacy and the protection of our human rights, assessing whether there are effective ways to mitigate any potential risks for these rights, thus informing decision-making in this area of crucial national interest.

This research is designed to support economic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, providing timely, actionable insight and recommendations about Working from Home (WfH), and the long-term implications of crisis-driven adaptations for organisational practice and policy responses. This proposal engages with three UKRI Research Questions: (1) how the pandemic has influenced different sectors in the UK; (2) the longer-term implications of WfH; and (3) which new behaviours and working practices will remain and which should be encouraged? A team of cross-institutional experts active in research related to WfH during lockdown, will employ a mixed-methods approach using an online survey, organisational case studies, and secondary analysis of national datasets. The research will explore both employer actions, practices and strategic decision-making, and employee experiences and outcomes of WfH during lockdown and its aftermath. Focusing on Professional Services and Public Administration, where access has been agreed in principle with employers in law and local government, a longitudinal perspective will contour and contextualise the recovery process in these sectors, selected for their contrasting business models, frontline pandemic response, and levels of WfH prior to the crisis-driven mass migration of white-collar workers into roles performed entirely from home. Our impact pathway will promote early engagement with findings: offering regular insight briefings on employee experience and outcomes; an employer summit that shares and shapes our assessment of whether WfH under the pandemic is activating wider changes in work organisation, job design, agility and flexibility; and a policy roundtable informing policy responses around ‘good work’ and flexible working.

1032	Rose Cook	King's College London	None	None	None	Gendering the UK's social policy response to the COVID-19 crisis	The COVID-19 outbreak and resultant economic crisis has led to governments around the world, including the UK, taking extraordinary action to support citizens facing unprecedented shocks to their livelihoods. Bodies such as the International Labour Organisation (ILO) recommend that such measures should include targeted support for the most affected population groups (ILO, 2020). Women form one of these groups, with disproportionate impacts on their employment and economic resources already documented (Adams-Prassl et al., 2020) amid concerns that the crisis will exacerbate underlying gender inequalities (Wenham, Smith and Morgan, 2020). To mitigate this and ensure a gender-sensitive recovery from the crisis, we need to understand the gendered nature and implications of current COVID-19 social policy interventions, which is currently lacking. To fill this gap, this project will gather information on global social policy responses and assess the extent to which they are gender-sensitive. We will produce a Policy Tracker to be made available to policy makers and the broader research and advocacy community to enable learning from other countries’ experiences and broaden the scope of existing trackers that have focused on global public health and fiscal responses. The project will further examine the extent to which different demographic groups and household types have accessed government support, and the relationship between different countries’ policy packages and longer term outcomes, with a focus on gender inequalities. In sum, the project will provide a comprehensive assessment of whether the UK’s social policy response is gender-sensitive, gender-blind or gender-neutral in its design, access and impacts.

National policing bodies have encouraged a compliance not coercion approach based upon the 4 E’s of Engage, Explain, Encourage and Enforce. In an innovative collaboration between the University of Portsmouth and Hampshire Constabulary, this research considers the impact of pandemic policing on the police and the public. It seeks to analyse the experiences of police officers and police leaders in exceptional circumstances and to explore the physical and psychological challenges of pandemic policing. This knowledge will provide evidence of i) organisational resilience, risk identification and effective decision-making, ii) strategies for the maintenance of future service delivery and iii) the impact of pandemic policing on police wellbeing. The research will also consider how the worldviews of individuals influence their perceptions of COVID-19 restrictions, their willingness to comply and key drivers of compliance/non-compliance which will shape the medium-long term police response. This knowledge will provide evidence of iv) effective policing in a crisis, v) public satisfaction/confidence in the police, vi) whether and for how long the public are willing to suspend their civil liberties and vii) factors that underlie any social/spatial variability. The link between perceptions of police legitimacy and willingness to comply means this understanding is crucial. Research findings will be scaled up into evidenced-based policing policies/practices nationally and its impact assessed and practices modified over the period of the crisis and beyond.

On-going improvements in AQ will be offset by planned growth in some regions. More detailed observations during a period of quickly changing pollutant emissions would expand our understanding of the complex interactions between human activities, pollutant emissions and AQ control measures. A focus will be the differing responses of particulate matter (PM) and gaseous pollutants. The COVID-19 period provides an unprecedented opportunity for additional measurement to illuminate factors which influencing UK air quality and health. Cranfield University (CU) is a controlled mixed (urban and rural) site in the ARCs heart. It has a self- contained campus with a unique combination of infrastructure, site types and facilities. The Cranfield Urban Observatory reference station is operating, and multi-species sensor units are available for immediate use. In this project, these units would be deployed as soon as possible at identified sites across the Oxford-Milton Keynes-Cambridge Arc (ARC) in order to provide a detailed observational record during a period of low traffic and industrial activity while COVID-19 restrictions are in place and being eased. Real-time information can be provided on the interaction between air quality and the easing of social distancing measures. These measurements made during a period of known intervention measures will inform infrastructure planning for the ARC and the design of Low Emission Zones and air quality policy more generally. The data will be available for use by researchers looking at before/during/after effects of these measures.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	None

1041	FILAMENT PD LTD	FILAMENT PD LTD	None	None	None	VapourSafe: Protecting front-line healthcare workers	On the 10th of April, the Health Secretary, Mr. Matt Hancock, said his goal was that everyone working in a critical role must get the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) that they need. A cross-government UK-wide plan to ensure that critical PPE is delivered to those on the frontline responding to COVID-19 was published. To help the NHS during this time of unprecedented global demand for PPE, Filament PD are leading the development of VapourSafe. The VapourSafe is a disposable protective device which covers the shoulders and head of the patient as they are being treated. The device surrounds the patient's face and contains vapor and particulate matter produced from the patient. This stops the spread of the virus beyond the enclosed volume. The VapourSafe creates an effective first line of defence against the spread of viral diseases in hospitals. The VapourSafe is an easy-to-use protective barrier which medical staff in hospital wards can utilise while treating patients with COVID-19 . It has been designed as a mass-manufacturable, one component product so no set up of the VapourSafe is required. The design allows for high numbers of the VapourSafe units to be stored vertically over a relatively small surface area; this reduces storage space, shipping costs and improves human usability. Once fitted over the patient, the medical team can gain access to the patient through four access points positioned conveniently around the patient. These access points will produce a partial seal while in use and fully reseal when not in use. Furthermore, the transparent polymer material allows for communication and visual examination of the patient. Advantages of the VapourSafe: * Fast-acting protective barrier which contains the spread of COVID-19 . * One, mass-manufacturable piece so no additional training is required. * Transparent material with multiple access points. * Minimal storage space required for transport and storage in hospital wards Based in Glasgow, Filament PD is a Product Development Agency who has released over 100 products for companies which range from start-ups through to global corporations. The development of the VapourSafe will utilise Filament's Design Process and integrated digital Quality Management System (QMS), which is compliant to ISO 9001:2015 .

1042	EVC POWERTECH LTD	EVC POWERTECH LTD	None	None	None	Temperature controlled and monitored distribution for vaccines and medicines	Working with a major pharmaceutical distribution company and with community nurses, we have identified a significant need for improving temperature-controlled and monitored distribution for medicines, test samples, blood transfusions and vaccines. Most urgently, we have identified four COVID-19 specific issues that will impact the UK that must be addressed right now: 1. When vaccines become available, they will require temperature-controlled environments. The UK's infrastructure to distribute these vaccines in these volumes is stretched. 2. There is insufficient refrigeration capability at surgeries, pharmacies and hospitals to handle the anticipated volumes. Nor is there a central monitoring system for monitoring vaccines and medicines held in these refrigerators. 3. District and community nurses currently have no temperature-controlled facilities for delivering vaccines. Unused vaccines are therefore destroyed at the end of each day. This already costs the NHS an estimated £4M annually and significantly reduces the overall number of vaccines available. 4. To rapidly implement mass immunisation, drive through vaccination sites are likely to be required across the country. These will require refrigeration facilities where there is no guarantee of a reliable power supply. eVc PowerTech are creating a low cost medical supply distribution system comprising of hand-held refrigerated tote boxes that incorporate real time temperature monitoring, and a docking system that will power the totes and act as a communications hub when the totes are in a distribution centre, in a vehicle or at a pharmacy, GP surgery or hospital. Our vision is to create a system that can be used throughout the healthcare industry for the safe transportation and handling of temperature-controlled medicines.

1043	SEETHRU NETWORKS LTD	SEETHRU NETWORKS LTD	None	None	None	Bringing full-service IT support to remote workers and SMEs to fuel the post-crisis recovery	Small companies across all sectors of the economy are adapting to the current environment by deploying on-line alternatives to their core services - whether they are restaurants delivering food and meals, doctors providing on-line consultations, performers and artists delivering streamed content or solicitors delivering legal services. Meanwhile larger companies are dependent on dispersed home-workers to maintain business-critical activities. Regardless of the precise timing or manner of the resolution to the Covid-19 crisis we know that on-line service delivery and dispersed teams will be a persistent feature. In a recent report on the BBC Professor Martin Marshall of the Royal College of GPs described the change from less than 15% of consultations carried out over the phone or online in 2019, compared to 90% during the 2020 lockdown. _"The big question is which elements do we want to embed in our practices in the future?"_ Prof Marshall said. _"I don't see us doing all of our consultations over the phone or online, but certainly up to 50% is possible."_ There were already 4.2m people working from home in 2015 (ONS). This rapidly growing cohort, together with 5.6m micro-SMEs, are poorly served when it comes to obtaining professional connectivity and on-line services. They are reliant on domestic-grade internet connections and ad-hoc IT support services to maintain key business operations. Too often the end user is frustrated by a technology provider service desk who tells them their issue lies with another technology organisation. The service help desk has the expense of dealing with support calls that they can't resolve. Think of the ISP receiving a call because a banking app is slow, a video conferencing platform isn't working or an email service isn't working correctly. None of these services are provide by the ISP, and meanwhile their connectivity provision is working perfectly. Our innovative platform enables the aggregation and communication of IT service data and facilitates easier co-operation between both the IT service providers themselves and their mutual end users. Our open platform will enable the UK's 750 ISP's and 135,000 digital service companies to access this market in a cost-effective manner. Experience from previous economic shocks shows that small businesses will be in the vanguard of economic recovery. Our aim is to enable the £8bn technical services market to underpin the recovery and growth of the crucial pan-sector SME community.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	49258.0 GBP

1045	ICARUUS LIMITED	ICARUUS LIMITED	None	None	None	Redesign of PPE to achieve rapid decentralised manufacturing, reusability and increased savings for the healthcare industry	This project proposes the redesign of the key pieces of PPE currently used by the NHS in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Current levels of demand for PPE are at their highest levels in living memory. A surge in hospitalisations has lead to depletion of national stockpiles and considerable distribution challenges. An additional lack of PPE manufacturers in the U.K. has greatly increased the cost and lead time of supplies arriving from overseas suppliers due to a lack of appropriate materials in the global supply chain and enormous competition from other purchasers. To address these challenges, we shall ambitiously redesign PPE to achieve rapid, localised manufacturing, reusability and significant cost savings to the NHS. Furthermore, this proposal will look to establish a virtual sampling system, a live lead time tracker and PPE manufacturing hubs in areas of the UK which are facing significant logistical obstacles. This will ensure that all healthcare stakeholders have access to rapid, sustainable and effective PPE for the foreseeable future. This project is proposed by Icaruus Limited, a small London based apparel and equipment design and manufacturing business. During this 6 month project, Icaruus shall aim to develop several iterations of CE certified PPE that will be market-tested and manufactured under lockdown conditions. The evidence gathered will enable Icaruus to release cheaper, locally produced PPE alternatives that will be ready for full-scale use by the NHS and other key worker institutions. A successful redesign of PPE requires both official certification and stakeholder approval. As such, Icarus has begun preliminary design and research with various London based NHS hospital trusts. Obtaining grant funding will greatly improve the scale and time frame of the redesign and ensure that the project has the best chance of reaching a successful conclusion.

We are specialists in mass-produced moulded foam components, servicing industries such as; sports, automotive, aerospace, oil and medical. As a result of the impact of Covid-19, we have focused our attention on developing a washable and reusable face mask to help meet the nation's shortfall in supply. The mask will have performance characteristics comparable to those in the market at the moment, can begin production within a month and can be mass-produced. The face mask is made from a moulded polyurethane foam which allows air to flow both ways and is designed to filter airborne droplets from both the wearer and the surrounding area. Because it is washable and reusable it is designed to be used in sub-clinical healthcare areas such as hospital cleaners, porters, ancillary staff, care workers. It is not designed for intimate healthcare contact where single-use, disposable masks destined for incineration would be most appropriate. Current masks are produced using either polyester or wood pulp fibres, each having limitations from a supply chain perspective. Our polyurethane mask sources almost all materials from the UK, with the remainder coming from Germany. As part of the moulding process, we can also incorporate antiviral and antimicrobial compounds which limit the risk of transmission. Our intention is to convert 3 of our 4 volume production lines to produce masks, with an initial output in excess of 20,000 units per week.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	44096.0 GBP

The number of people in debt is likely to increase significantly leaving many in financial distress and placing significant burdens on financial institutions. The resultant social, health, and economic costs threaten to be severe. This work programme provides a conversational interface for people in financial distress to enable them to engage with their financial institutions in a user-friendly way via frictionless, asynchronous, and automated technology. The benefits include providing people in financial distress with a supportive and sympathetic process that they can use in their own time. For the financial institutions, they benefit from greatly reduced costs of service. Commercial-strength Conversational Interfaces are simple to use because users can talk about their requirements and actions in everyday language. The ability to use text and voice, and supporting vernacular, slang, and poor grammar and spelling, makes the conversational interface non-discriminatory and accessible regardless of gender, age, or ethnicity, whether stationary or on the move.

1049	TAYLOR GARFIT LIMITED	TAYLOR GARFIT LIMITED	None	None	None	Light Weight Face Visor (PPE); for use by front line services dealing with Covid-19	The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a desperate requirement to increase the supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the UK. Frontline staff in hospitals, GPs, the ambulance service, care homes, prisons and other public sector services are crying out for more PPE. In the Covid-19 daily TV briefing session of 11/04/20, Government Health Secretary, Matt Hancock made a direct appeal to all UK industry to produce PPE, even if this is a product in which they had no previous experience. This project is a response to that appeal by opening a new area of supply for one element of the required PPE, so that frontline staff fighting the virus can be given the protection they need. The project brings together four established UK companies to provide innovation in the design, development, manufacture and supply of a face-visor to give eye protection, which is a critical element of the PPE set. The design consultancy Taylor Garfit Ltd has developed a concept for a visor which uses innovative materials rather than plastic. Thus allowing it to be mass-produced using an established UK manufacturing sector that has hitherto not produced PPE. The project will support increased demand by supplementing existing sources of face visor production. Four companies have agreed to cooperate in the development and production of this visor. A significant advantage of the proposed supply chain is that it is entirely UK based; whilst many of the current visors are sourced from overseas, with commensurate problems in product availability and long lead-times, as global demand escalates.

1051	VAMSTAR LIMITED	VAMSTAR LIMITED	None	None	None	AI-powered COVID-19 supplier risk index and demand planning toolkit	For health systems to better prepare and plan for the months ahead, Vamstar will create a risk-based framework to understand supply chain gaps and the evolving demand at a hospital-level in the UK and EU. The objective of the risk scoring matrix and the Demand-Planning-Toolkit is to focus on the most vulnerable parts of the health systems in Europe and facilitate decision making as quickly as possible. With the supply risk framework, we will be able to predict changes in the overall demand for various essential products and services needed to manage a crisis like COVID-19 and direct the focus of suppliers towards the most needed parts of the care delivery. Combining this with the Demand-Planning-Toolkit, Vamstar will be able to assess which suppliers have fulfilled a current order in the market and make predictions about when they will become fully production-ready to sell again. Additionally, the risk scoring framework and Demand-Planning-Toolkit will help stakeholders in the care delivery chain quickly assess countries that have developed or are developing preventative infrastructure and share the findings. This framework and connected real-time supply chain analytics will ensure that in the future such crises are managed with a more proactive strategy vs a reactive supply chain approach currently prevalent in our health systems. By analysing this dataset through artificial intelligence, we want to understand the Pandemic-Supply-Risk both from a macro (ability) and micro (willingness) levels needed to manage a pandemic like COVID-19 . This toolkit includes necessary items such as face masks but also digital platforms that will aid in patient and population health management across these countries as it undergoes a rapid transformation. Vamstar offers a data science powered platform for predicting and matching public contracts in healthcare and will create an automated "pandemic preparedness toolkit" specifically by using supply chain risk scoring matrix so as to focus on the most vulnerable parts of the health systems affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. It will leverage EU and UK data on public and private tendering, pricing sources and economic annual datasets to do this. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning will be used for tasks such as predicting ongoing list of suppliers with spare capacity, the date of shortages, and prices of key supplies. These predictions and analysis will form part of reports and an autonomous dashboard that will benefit the NHS hospitals and healthcare suppliers.

1052	VANGUARDIA LIMITED	VANGUARDIA LIMITED	None	None	None	Virtual Acoustic Audience Reality_Covid-19	Virtual Audience Acoustic Reality (VAAR) is an innovative project that helps the entertainment industry quickly restart live events in the event of catastrophic events similar to Covid-19 and provides resilience for the future. It also offers an opportunity for a significant economic bounce back as lockdown is relaxed and physical audiences return, VAAR audiences provide a new stream of revenue. Entertainment, whether music or sport, has the ability to change how we feel, and creates a sense of shared connection to the spectacle. Audiences to this point in time have enjoyed live entertainment in one of two ways: by either being physically at the venue or by passively watching a broadcast remotely. The concept of VAAR enables a real and active high quality two way connection between the live event and the remote audience. The unique feature is how this remote audience is fully connected with the content and the venue to become an integrated participant in the overall event and the atmosphere that is created. The vision is that an individual at home can buy a virtual ticket and enjoy the full live atmosphere from a music or sporting event delivered via a direct link from the venues sound and vision systems to receive a high quality blended real time experience. This can also be connected with hospitality (including food, beverage, merchandise and hired technology), delivered to the door, for a more enhanced experienced. Partners and sponsorship are also a further form of revenue generation. The individuals connection is enhanced by their ability to provide their own input to the experience within the venue by way of a unique platform and App. The App and the interfaces at the audience and venue end provides a connection which other remote individuals can join and share the experience as a group, and also with the venue and performing artists or competing teams. VAAR connects remote audiences with the live atmosphere being generated by the artist's/sports person's performance and the venue, bringing a new era in audience participation and immersive experience. The collaboration to develop VAAR encompasses individuals and companies with a diverse range of skills from acoustic engineering, audio visual design, architect and talented singer songwriter.

1055	ARR RAIL SOLUTIONS LTD	ARR RAIL SOLUTIONS LTD	None	None	None	Safe & Comfy Medical Jacket	Although Covid-19 pandemic has posed many challenges for the country, a more specific challenge is the need to address the dangers of infection, unnecessary distress, fatigue, and mental anxiety that result from the demanding working environment of the frontline hospital and health care staff. Although basic personal protective equipment such as visors/goggles, masks and gowns are available, albeit in limited quantities, recent news in the media has clearly depicted visible signs of distress and extreme fatigue on the faces of these scarce specialist staff. Thus, the objective of the project is to bring together proven knowledge of medical fabrics and the science of controlled circulation of fresh air within enclosed fabric suits to provide a more comfortable environment for front-line staff and health care workers. Ensuring comfort while maintaining the highest level of safety will enable them to undertake their duties without avoidable fatigue and stress. The proposers acknowledge that several small to large companies have or are adapting their manufacturing capabilities to produce PPE for health service but believe that the novelty of introducing user comfort into the design together with the highest level of protection against infection has an offering worthy of support. The project is based on a very modest level of support to build a prototype that can be submitted for critical assessment by front-line medical staff. Cost of any necessary modifications to prototype or further development will be the subject of a follow-up project while a move to commercial manufacturing and exploitation of the developed PPE will be justified by the appropriate business case.

1056	RAIQC LTD	RAIQC LTD	None	None	None	Report and Image Quality Control	Studies from around the world have shown that medical imaging studies such as Chest X-ray and CT scans have a high accuracy in detecting lung changes related to Covid-19 . Unlike the lab based diagnostic techniques which are in shortage world-wide and require at least a few hours to process, imaging investigations are widely available and provide immediate results. In addition to aiding diagnosis, imaging is also used to assess disease severity, identify other underlying lung conditions and monitor disease progression. It also plays a key in providing alternative causes for the patient's symptoms such as pneumonia, heart failure or pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung) which are potentially life-threatening conditions that would require a different treatment. However, the accuracy of the diagnosis relies on the ability of the image interpreter to be able to recognise the features of Covid-19 on the imaging study. We propose creating a web-based training and simulation tools that can be used to quickly train a large number of individuals including physicians, junior doctors, radiographers and nurses to recognise the imaging features of Covid-19 to aid with its diagnosis and management. Beyond the current pandemic, the platform will have the ability to host educational material related to other diagnoses such as cancer, stroke and trauma. Therefore it will act as a standardised quality assessment tool reducing variation in practice and potential for patient harm. It will provide benchmarking at a national level to help address concerns over standards. Additionally, the tool will allow a wider workforce to be trained allowing quicker diagnosis of time critical diseases such as cancer while saving outsourcing costs for NHS which totalled £165milion in 2018 .

1057	PXD LIMITED	PXD LIMITED	None	None	None	Development of an algorithm to stratify risk to Covid-19 by MHC haplotype.	Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes underpin host response to pathogens, including Covid-19 . MHC proteins have a functional peptide binding groove (PBG) that binds foreign peptides (antigens) within a cell. Once bound, the MHC-antigen complex translocates to the surface of the cell, which then stimulate an immune response. MHC genes thus play a critical role in the the overall immune response. The three-dimensional structure of the PBG determines which regions of antigens are bound by MHC proteins. Thus, MHC haplotypes, and subsequent variability within the PBG, can change how the antigen is presented externally, thus directly impacting the shape of the antibody produced during an immune response. Recent work has identified marked variation in MHC haplotype distribution between geographical areas affected more or less severely by COVID-19, and within different ethnic populations. Not only might these haplotype differences underpin stronger or weaker host immune responses to Covid-19, they could also undermine serological testing - certain MHC haplotypes may present antigens in such a way that the host antibodies raised are weakly or not detectable by mass-produced serological tests. PXD is currently developing algorithms to predict likelihood of developing an immune response to implanted materials, based upon MHC haplotypes. PXD will leverage this expertise to create an MHC-based diagnostic tool with utility for: * identifying individuals that may be at heightened risk for a dysregulated (overly aggressive) response to Covid-19 . * identifying which commercial serological tests will give the most accurate results for their MHC haplotype. * use as a companion diagnostic by the pharmaceutical industry during therapeutic development. **innovation:** Diagnostic algorithm for predicting immune response to Covid-19 antigens based on MHC haplotyping assay data combined with 3-D protein modelling. **TEAM:** * Carlos Echevarria, Respiratory Consultant, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne. * Stephen Wright, Clinical Director Research and Development, Consultant in Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Newcastle Hospitals. * Dr Anthony Poles, Consultant Clinical Scientist and Head of the NHSBT Histocompatibilty & Immunogenetics laboratory, Bristol. * Heather Cordell, Professor of Statistical Genetics, Institute of Human Genetics, Newcastle University. * Rebecca Darlay, Research Associate, Institute of Human Genetics, Newcastle University. * Pravin Khalia.

1058	DRINK TECH LIMITED	DRINK TECH LIMITED	None	None	None	Convenience Store Online Marketplace & Delivery for the Vulnerable	Before Covid-19, consumer demand for convenience and online shopping were on a clear rise. Unfortunately for local high street shops, this meant reduced footfall and in-store sales compounded by the pressure of increasing business rates. The current pandemic has unfortunately **exacerbated the pressures on local shops**. It has also highlighted the need for home delivery, especially to those who can't physically shop for groceries and essentials, people like the **vulnerable**, **NHS staff**, and the **elderly**. The latest Google analytics Mobility Report for the UK shows physical traffic to shops is down by 41%. Unfortunately it's not uncommon to read headlines like "Coronavirus Shutdown Ravages High Street". While grocery stores are trying hard to meet delivery demand, they simply can't keep up. Average wait times are now exceeding three weeks. There is a solution though, our local convenience stores are well-stocked and looking for additional revenue. The problem is that to-date convenience stores have been underserved for online sales and delivery. That's why we propose developing and operating a **purpose-built online marketplace and delivery platform specifically connecting local convenience stores and customers need**. Drinkly started trading three years ago after understanding the need in consumer demand for ecommerce and the need for high street retailers to find new revenue streams as more consumers were shopping online. We focussed on the underserved off-licence sector and have worked hard to drive revenue to off-license store owners. Our efforts have paid off, adding over 30% revenue to our first retail partner. We've also been recognised by industry for our work, being named 2019 Scottish SME Digital Business of the Year and being listed as one of TechNation's Top 2020 UK Startups. In the throes of Covid-19, we understand how much more than ever consumers need home delivery of essential household items and that local independent retailers need to sell online to secure the future of their businesses during _and_ after the pandemic. With our knowledge of building a marketplace and delivery platform for the off-licence trade, **we're uniquely positioned to use our technical and business experience to make this project a success**. This grant will allow us to develop and quickly deploy technology to connect convenience stores and customers and **play an important part in helping customers and retailers during these difficult times and beyond**.

1059	VEON SCIENTIFIC LTD	VEON SCIENTIFIC LTD	None	None	None	Compact Lab System for COVID-19 Sample Preparation	Veon Scientific are a manufacturer of custom liquid handling and automated robotics for laboratory sample handling. They are seeking to break down the boundaries between manual pipetting and automated liquid handling by developing an innovative low cost liquid handling robot combined with an intuitive touch screen application suited for quick set-up of simple tasks or complex assays. It is well established that robotic automation or liquid handling systems can be used to increase the reliability, accuracy, throughput and speed of sample preparation however Veon Scientific are combining these key advantages with a scaled down system. Furthermore, this development creates a technology with such affordability and simplicity that it will be accessible to all laboratory scientists bridging the gap in the market between manual pipetting and automated techniques. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, significant demand has been placed on laboratories to perform a high quantity of clinical tests to determine if patients have contracted the virus. qPCR and PCR are the globally established molecular biology techniques to perform this test. Clinical samples (saliva swabs, serum, etc) need to go through preparative steps prior to performing the qPCR process and ultimately achieving a clinical result for the patient. The inability of existing large format automated systems to really address the needs of the lab is evident in the fact that, amidst the COVID -19 crisis, many front-line lab technicians are using manual pipetting to process samples. Veon Scientific have identified this unique need for a liquid handling system that is inexpensive, extremely simple and fast to operate, and sufficiently compact to fit at a lab technicians' individual workspace. A further significant benefit of this technology is the time capacity that is created by removing the need for laboratory scientists to perform labour intensive tasks. This will enable scientists in industry to focus their time on other aspects of science, including developing a better understanding of the COVID-19 virus or maximising laboratory efficiencies and reducing error.

1060	SUNAMP LIMITED	SUNAMP LIMITED	None	None	None	Development of temporary high-volume hand-wash facilities to suppress re-infection rates in a staged lockdown phase-out	Stringent hand hygiene prevents the spread of coronavirus and washing correctly with soap and water is proven more effective than hand sanitisers. Easy access to facilities at the point of need is essential to encourage frequent handwashing and removes the need to move around buildings unnecessarily to find clean running water. This is critical in the temporary field hospitals set up to treat Covid 19 patients, as well as workplaces of other essential workers. As the country emerges from lockdown, it will be vital that people continue to be diligent about cleanliness. Sunamp's mobile handwash units will use RAL certified heat battery technology aimed at cutting carbon emissions to provide large amounts of hot water when and, crucially, where it is needed most, whether on temporary wards, in the workplace or out in the field. The mobile handwash units will not require any plumbing or electrical expertise to become operational. On arrival on site, they can simply be plugged in for 2 -- 3 hours to charge the battery, then the unit can be moved into position where the stored energy will be released as heat providing instant hot water on demand. Multiple units will be smartly controlled to be charged by a standard wall plug. There will be no trailing wires. The water supply will either be held in a storage container concealed as part of the unit, or from a pipe attached to cold mains water where it is readily available. Wastewater will be collected in a container to be safely disposed of. Sunamp's mobile hand washing units will be developed to: * Provide instant hot water for improved comfort and efficacy for hand sanitisation, or for cleaning implements and utensils at the point where it is needed * Be fully mobile - suitable for use with and without either a plumbed-in water supply or nearby energy supply * Be easy to use by dispensing with the need for plumbing or electrical expertise * Minimise the risk of legionella disease -- water is stored at cold temperature and is heated instantly and only as required * Meet demand -- the units will supply enough clean hot water to allow one person per minute per basin to thoroughly wash their hands in hot water without the need for connection to an energy supply * Require minimum maintenance - heat batteries have a proven lifecycle of over 40,000 cycles, more than 50 years of normal use	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	49989.0 GBP
1061	ELISHA SYSTEMS LIMITED	ELISHA SYSTEMS LIMITED	None	None	None	Affinity Biosensors for COVID-19 Antibodies	Biosensors provide an extremely useful, user friendly and cost effective route for rapid diagnosis. This has been seen for diabetics with the introduction of the blood glucose biosensor in the 1990's, which now has advanced to full disease management systems using smartphones. With new technological advances discovered to link affinity reagents to electronic surfaces, it is now possible to produce biosensors to any protein. Affinity reagents are biochemicals that bind proteins e.g. antibodies or virus antigens, very tightly thereby making the tests being developed absolutely specific to the target being detected. The vision for this project and the main area of focus will be to generate biosensors to coronavirus antibodies and antigens (COVID-19) to make a serological test for the virus. Associated with this main aim is a trial of a new set of electronic components to run the biosensors created. Combining these and the biosensors made will allow the production of a compact field measurement system to detect if a person has been infected and even if a person is still infected. The project protocols will demonstrate the feasibility of the biosensors to be manufactured and also to test their sensitivity and specificity to the virus proteins to be detected. To date the serological tests to detect COVID-19 have been inadequate in field use. It is aimed to overcome this with new specific reagents being incorporated into the biosensors and this will be a prime outcome of the project. In addition to detecting COVID-19, the whole system is future proofed, because it will be possible to change the specificity of the biosensors by changing the affinity reagent used. Therefore if a different virus appears, proteins and antibodies associated with any new virus can be detected by making a different biosensor with different reagents to change the specificity. In addition, the device described could be adapted to detect any protein, giving the capability of detecting any disease in the future.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	44234.0 GBP
1062	BRITEYELLOW LIMITED	BRITEYELLOW LIMITED	None	None	None	Remote Monintoring of People in Need	Concern for the wellbeing of vulnerable people in care homes or living in isolation is growing. Emerging data from care providers shows that the Covid-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on the elderly and most frail in care homes. Falls can also lead to someone dying when they bang their head and suffer a bleed. Fall deaths rose by 105% between 2008 and 2016 whereas the number of over-85s went up by only 19%. Currently there is no available, accurate, real-time, remote motion monitoring for isolated people living independently or in care homes. Existing approaches are not accurate or reliable. Briteyellow's solution will overcome these shortcomings. Using new and more accurate wireless technologies, it will provide effective real-time monitoring and alert system for carers of isolated people, at home. The system is based on a small wearable device linked to an application. The wearable device will use ultra-precision motion tracking technology developed by Briteyellow to detect the location and motion of individuals inside their homes. The product will be worn by people at home and send data to carers automatically. And through the application of sophisticated pattern recognition, the application will identify any anomalies and trigger urgent intervention that can save lives. This solution will help carers of people in need living independently or in isolation as a result of Covid-19 to maintain high quality care provision. It will also improve resource efficiency for care providers by allowing care workers to monitor more patients remotely. Helping to alleviate the impact of the shortages of nurses and care workers. And giving carers more precise data that can improve the efficiency of the whole social care system. Whilst providing vulnerable people with the assurance that their well-being is being monitored always. This solution is especially needed now with the growing requirement for self-isolation to protect the elderly from Covid-19 . It will be accessible through a smartphone app or web portal.

1063	CLYTELL (UK) LIMITED	CLYTELL (UK) LIMITED	None	None	None	Emergency Construction for COVID19: A Voice-Activated BIM System for Boosting Productivity for On-Site ASSEMBLAGE and DISASSEMBLY	**BACKGROUND AND PROBLEM STATEMENT:** According to WHO (2020), the outbreak of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a global pandemic that has recorded more than 2.06million cases, resulting in more than 137,000 deaths. Although more than 510,000 people have recovered, evidence suggests that there may be a possibility of relapse or reinfection (Independent, 2020). To cater for the ever-increasing number of active cases and the uncertain possibility of relapse or reinfection, a number of countries, including the UK are desperately constructing new hospitals and/or convert convention centres into temporary hospitals (e.g. London' ExCel Centre, UWE Bristol's Exhibition Centre into Nightingale Hospitals). Owing to the time-critical nature of the Emergency Construction of temporary hospitals, it is imperative to boost on-site productivity as much as possible. According to PBC Today (2019), Building Information Modelling (BIM) has been unanimously agreed to being central to boosting productivity for on-site assemblage and disassembly. However, evidence suggests that to realise the actual productivity-boosting benefits of BIM, its usability needs to be modernised (Goucher and Thurairajah, 2012). At present, BIM provides Conventional Web and Mobile interfaces for interactions that require tremendous time and efforts to master their usage. However, in this trying time where time is of the essence and workers are fearful about their safety away from their homes. The last thing on-site assemblage and disassembly workers need is to spend needless time searching BIM models while performing their routine tasks. This limitation reduces on-site workers' productivity and defeats the purpose of Emergency Construction. It is on this premise that this Clytell has spent the last 11 months developing a Voice-Activated BIM system for boosting productivity for on-site assemblage and disassembly (Voice-BIM). **THE INTERVENTION OF VOICE-BIM AND ITS BENEFIT:** In light of this COVID-19 pandemic, Voice-BIM will significantly improve productivity by enabling users to quickly interact with BIM Models using their voice. This will aid on-site assemblage and disassembly. Also, Voice-BIM will potentially reduce the spread of COVID-19 amongst on-site workers as the amount of time they touch on-site hardware to access BIM tools will be significantly reduced.

Using two linked case control studies, we aim to estimate the relative importance of occupational exposures and non-workplace related factors in risk of infection. Additional longitudinal follow-up of the participants will allow us to examine risks among asymptomatic carriers, determine antibody durability and track the pandemic evolution in HCW. We will recruit 5000 HCW from diverse backgrounds and job-roles within three large NHS Trusts in West Midlands. Participants will include HCW with COVID-19 symptoms and have had PCR tests, as well as 1000 of those without symptoms. Cases are HCW with positive PCR results and controls will be a matched sample of those tested negative. We will collect data on personal and health characteristics, type/nature of work, extent and type of interaction with COVID-19 patients, and ability to use recommended infection control procedures. Those with positive tests will be asked about symptoms in household members and the symptomatic ones will be tested for SARS-CoV-2. We will compare occupational and other characteristics by PCR status to examine the relative contribution of occupational and non-workplace risk factors. Participants will be followed up, with blood tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at 3-months and repeated at 6 months. Using interviews with up to 30 purposively selected staff and 20 managers, we will explore access to and use of infection control procedures, to understand any barriers or facilitators. The findings will inform future workplace policies and resource allocation decisions.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	444883.0 GBP

COVID-19 is set to become a global pandemic. Near real time information is needed to inform NHS planning and public health response. This includes community incidence (regardless of seeking care), risk factors for disease, clinical symptoms, case hospitalisation and mortality ratios, asymptomatic viral shedding, asymptomatic infection, household transmission risk and population behaviours during periods of wellness and illness (including social contact and movement, respiratory hygiene and health seeking behaviours). This information can only be gathered accurately through large scale community studies. Our experience of the MRC/Wellcome FluWatch study and ESRC BugWatch study allows us to rapidly establish two six-month national household cohorts (April-September 2020) and (October 2020-March 2021) of 25,000 individuals each (2,500 in each region of England and Wales) for online symptom and behaviour reporting and optional use of an app allowing their mobile phones to be used as GPS trackers enabling secure transfer and analysis of detailed movement patterns. Two sub-cohorts (10,000 individuals each) will also self-swab when ill for detection of COVID-19 and other circulating viruses. We will also conduct a London based study (200 households) following household contacts of COVID-19 cases for 28 days with daily symptom reporting, regular swabbing and baseline and follow up serology to investigate household transmission and asymptomatic infection and virus shedding. We will use data from Virus Watch to train whole population prediction models based on social media and search engine data and develop spatiotemporal models.

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project. Efficient response to COVID-19 requires an understanding of the epidemiological and behavioural drivers of disease transmission. Due to the rapidly evolving outbreak and the mitigation strategies likely to be put in place at different times, analyses of epidemic drivers and policy evaluation need constant updating to provide relevant data-driven evidence to inform evolving public health choices. We will provide rapid, continually updated estimates of key epidemiological features such as disease severity and transmissibility measures and lengths of stay. Surveillance, serological and sequence data (where available) will be analysed accounting for censoring and reporting delays. Mathematical models will be fit to the emerging data streams using Bayesian methods to provide regular forecasting updates and assess the impact of current or potential future interventions. Contact and precautionary behaviours will be monitored in a representative cohort along with information on risk awareness and perceived efficacy of interventions to refine transmission models, improve forecasting, and assess the effectiveness of social distancing measures. Special attention will be given to sharing results in an open and timely manner. Epidemiological parameter estimates and forecasts will be shared on a public website, updated daily. User-friendly web interfaces will allow users to generate model outputs and investigate the impact of specific model assumptions on different policy findings. Highlights of essential results will be gathered in short policy briefs updated weekly. Findings will immediately inform UK policy through participation on UK Government advisory committees.

The app will enable informal carers to receive peer support for their caring practices, access targeted, credible and accurate learning resources, and minimize isolation. Qualitative interviews with carers using the app will assess impact of the app on reduced risk of spreading infection by minimising in-person interactions, but increased peer support.

The spread and outbreak of the virus in care homes has varied greatly across the sector, sometimes with devastating impact. The incidence and death rate from COVID-19 in UK care homes is, as yet, not known. However, until effective vaccines for the virus are available, older care home residents will remain vulnerable and at greater risk of poorer outcome if they were to contract COVID-19. Capturing lessons learnt about the symptoms, progression and management of this viral infection in the older population (aged over 65 years) and sharing these lessons learnt with care homes that have not yet experienced an outbreak of the virus is crucial. This is the focus for our work. We will conduct four phases of work. First, we will interview up to 30 health and social care practitioners, caring for older people (aged over 65 years) in hospitals and care homes. We will ask practitioners to reflect on what they have learnt about the symptoms of the virus in this population and its progression, in particular what worked well (or what more is needed) when caring for older people with the virus. In the next phase, we will share these lessons learnt (Phase 1) with up to 10 senior care home staff and discuss strategies that are being, or could be used, for managing COVID-19 in care homes. We will use these findings to design an online survey of care home providers to ‘sense-check’ our findings and identify any further gaps that need to be addressed at a national level. The final phase will be to co-create resources with and for the sector and informed by the findings of this work.	The Dunhill Medical Trust	Research Project & Programme Grants	15000.0 GBP

Aim: To generate rapid evidence based on public views/response, informaing public health interventions to encourage timely symptom presentation, screening engagement and cancer- related health behaviours in the wake of the panedmic. Design: Prospective mixed-methods cohort study in the UK population. Methods: During June-August 2020, and again six months later, we will conduct a UK-Wide population survey of adults aged 18+ measuring attitudes and behaviour in the domains of cancer symptom presentation, screening, smoking, alcohol, diet and physical activity. We will sample from established online cohorts, supplemented with social media recruitment. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with survey participants to understand the contextual influences on cancer attitudes and behaviour. Using existing linked data, we will assess primary care referrals and investigations for suspected cancer symptoms, screening, smoking cessation and number/stage of new cancers diagnosed in the Welsh cohort. Analysis: Multivariable modelling will be used to assess determinants of symptom presentation (primary analysis), screening and health behaviours, and to identify longitudinal predictors of health service use and cancer outcomes. Qualitative data will be analysed thematically, with triangulation of data sources. Outputs: We will provide rapid recommendations to drive tailored public health initiatives for cancer early detection and prevention in the pandemic recovery period. Longer-term, the study will lay the foundations for assessing policy impact in response to future global health threats.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	551851.0 GBP

It is unknown to what extent the restrictions have eased pressure on the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) with concerns e.g. about house parties and domestic violence. Furthermore, whenever restrictions ease, businesses will seek to recoup losses, whilst people may drink more/celebrate/party when they are allowed out – potentially increasing call-outs above pre-CV levels, whilst SAS will remain vital first responders to CV. We will: interview premises owners & key stakeholders about options for managing/staggering the lifting of restrictions to minimise pressure on services and about infection control practices/innovation in licensed venues. We will examine ambulance call-outs before, during (and if possible after) CV restrictions. If timing allows, we will examine & observe customer behaviour and venue operation when restrictions are lifted. This study will feed quickly and directly into policy regarding lifting of CV restrictions on licensed premises, guidance for re-opening premises, and the management of any future on/off restrictions.

Methods We will use an ongoing UK Biobank project already designed to investigate ethnic health in UK Biobank, which includes half a million adults, of which there are over 8000 SAs and 8000 BACs. Through this application we have access to linked COVID-19 data, which will include test results, hospitalisation and mortality. Logistic and survival modelling will be used to quantify the risk of SAs and BACs compared to WEs and to investigate possible mediators and effect modifiers. Preparatory work In preparation for this application, we have downloaded over 3000 unique tests results available to date. SAs and BACs were around twice as likely to have confirmed COVID-19 compared to white Europeans, with early evidence that this risk is modified by key markers of health status, including BMI. Conclusion This application is designed to provide greater context to the risk of COVID-19 and resulting complications in BACs and SAs which will help tailor public health policy in the future.

However, there is no clinical evidence to support this and there is much confusion for both patients and doctors. Many patients are stopping their hypertension medication, which is dangerous as this could lead to severe heart disease and even death. Our study will examine if hypertensive patients have more severe COVID-19 than patients who do not have pre-existing hypertension. We will also assess if certain blood pressure drugs aggravate or improve infection. This is especially important in Scotland where the rate of hypertension is high.

Therefore, if we wish to design a brief, effective public health message to encourage preventive behaviours, we must identify the specific determinants and moderators of these behaviours. We will provide this information by conducting a systematic review of the determinants of behaviours (such as handwashing and social distancing) that aim to prevent the spread of communicable illnesses. To enhance the appropriateness of the findings, we will only include research about communicable illnesses that are transmitted in a similar way and have similar symptoms to COVID-19. These illnesses include severe acute respiratory syndrome, H1N1 influenza and other types of flu. We will also include any relevant evidence about COVID-19 that emerges. The systematic review will follow the guidance on Conducting Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses of Observational Studies of Etiology (COSMOS-E) and Cochrane guidance for COVID-19 rapid reviews and will include the following stages: electronic literature search; eligibility assessment; quality assessment; data extraction and synthesis; dissemination of findings. The research team have the necessary expertise and experience to carry out this review and disseminate its findings. Through this project, we will identify the most important variables to be addressed in public health messages and disseminate these findings to public health bodies. Therefore, the project will help to optimise the effectiveness of any messages designed to encourage preventive behaviours for COVID-19 or any future similar situations, thereby serving to minimise contagion.

We recognise the gap in LMICs where there is an under financed health system and low capacity of health care workers (HCWs) in hospitals, public and private primary care facilities and the community/ NGO to respond to the pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) has produced technical guidance, but the guidance documents are broad, they have to be updated with new developments, and translated into guidelines for HCWs, i.e., doctors, nurses and community health workers for hospitals, primary care and community in LMICs. Here we choose the Philippines and Sri Lanka because they both reported Covid-19 cases, and we can quickly mobilize resources. We aim to develop an integrated plan for HCWs to respond to the pandemic, as well as role-specific guidelines to manage Covid-19 suspects and cases regarding hospital patient flow, infection control, patient supervision and support in communities. We will learn from frontline experiences in China and update our understanding. We will work with policymakers, HCWs and NGOs in the Philippines and Sri Lanka to develop the guidelines and training modules. We will pilot test the tools for feasibility and acceptability among HCWs in the Philippines, adapt in Sri Lanka, and generate a generic version for LMICs to respond to Covid-19 and any future similar pandemic. Our integrated response strategy aims to update skills of HCWs, reduce patient overload at hospitals, avoid hospital transmission, reduce community transmission and public panic, provide patient support and reduce stigma. Our professional team consists of researchers from Canada, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka. The team has strong related experience and can quickly produce a draft guideline and materials within 2 months and finalize all work in 24 months.

The way infectious diseases transmit, and spread is different depending on where individuals live and, on their movements, and interactions. This means that epidemic models must take spatial features into account for accurate predictions, which currently they do not do effectively. We also must consider how infections affect individuals differently, e.g. weaker immune systems, gender and age. We will create a spatial mathematical model for COVID-19 that simulates infection in the body and the spread of disease from person to person. This multiscale model will be capable of robust predictions.	Chief Scientist Office	Research Grant	25816.0 GBP

What is the quality of COVID-19-related information on the internet that is actually consumed by people? 4. Can inaccurate information and conspiracy thinking be effectively countered by informational interventions? Each component of the project will seek to increase our scientific understanding of information consumption and belief updating about science, health, and other controversial subjects while also generating practical, real-world recommendations that will help policymakers, journalists, and science communicators to design policies and deliver information that will help stop the pandemic. By combining a multi-wave survey experiment with a large enough sample to examine highly affected areas (e.g., West Midlands) and behavioural exposure data, this study will provide the most systematic measurement to date of (1) the accuracy of the COVID-related beliefs about public health and public policy; (2) the prevalence of health and policy misconceptions related to COVID-19 and the correlates of those misconceptions; (3) the prevalence of exposure to both highquality and untrustworthy information about COVID-19, including the most important sources of (mis)information and the correlates of consumption of both types of information; and (4) the effectiveness of corrective information in combating COVID-related misconceptions.

Emergency public health measures were implemented across the UK in early 2020 to suppress COVID-19 transmission; with major implications for ambient air quality (AQ). Well publicised satellite data have indicated associated reductions in air pollutant (AP) concentrations with potential benefits for human health; however ground-based measurements suggest more complex trends in UK cities. These events present a unique natural experimental opportunity to better understand environmental consequences arising from these measures and to apply this learning to future AQ intervention scenarios. Our research focus is Oxford (population ~155,000). Oxford has significant AQ and health inequity challenges, with the equivalent of 1 in 20 early deaths attributed to AP exposure. The City and County Councils plan to introduce a Zero Emissions Zone and enhanced Low Emission Zone from 2021 and to achieve carbon neutral status by 2030. Oxford is also a focal point for existing research activity, including NIHR, Defra, Highways England and Research England funded studies supporting a broad range of environmental and transport monitoring capabilities and existing research infrastructure, which we plan to utilise and repurpose for this study. We plan a 18 month study to integrate longitudinal data arising from multiple observational inputs (e.g. AQ, noise, smart roadside sensors) to enable robust evaluation of the positive and negative impacts of introduction, maintenance and removal of COVID-19 measures in Oxford City. The data we assimilate will be used to generate a series of AQ control scenarios and predicted health benefits, thereby informing and redefining council-led AQ policy and climate strategy.

With free movement restricted during lockdown and health and wellbeing threatened by Covid-19, it is especially important now to understand this relationship. We will work with Natural England (NE) to examine the impact of Covid-19 on nature engagement and wellbeing in the UK and support Government strategies aimed at ameliorating impacts and managing recovery. Four studies are proposed analysing data on nature-engagement and wellbeing in: (1) a longitudinal survey study post lockdown (July 2020-21), (2) an analysis of social media comments posted during lockdown, (3) an ethnographic study of experiences during and post lockdown, and (4) analyses of nationally representative NE data pre, during and post lockdown. Aim 1). To study how wellbeing and use of natural spaces (e.g., gardens, parks, countryside) during and post lockdown have changed across the UK. Access to green space is linked to wellbeing (Alcock et al., 2014), but little is know about the impact of disruptions to access. Aim 2). To develop a novel systematic mapping of multiple wellbeing outcomes (hedonic (e.g., mood), as well as eudaimonic (e.g., purpose and meaning; Ryan & Deci, 2008)) and access and use of different types of natural spaces (gardens, parks, the countryside). Aim 3). To further theory development. Experiencing a sense of "being away" (from everyday stressors and demands) can help explain the nature-wellbeing link (Von Lindern, 2017). Lockdown provides a unique insight into the meaning of mentally and physically "being away".	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	201482.0 GBP

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project. Predicting the size and duration of potential COVID-19 outbreaks is an essential component of public-health planning and preparedness. Mathematical models of disease transmission are potentially powerful tools for predicting the course of an upcoming epidemic and evaluating control and mitigation strategies. However, standard models of disease transmission without population structure overestimate the speed of invasion of a novel pathogen. We have developed a spatial metapopulation transmission model for the UK that is grounded in demographic data which incorporates regular (commuter-like) movements of individuals. In previous work, we demonstrated that regular, repeated movements lead to slower epidemic spread. Adapting this model for COVID-19, we estimated that an uncontrolled epidemic in England and Wales would peak ~4 months following sustained person-to-person transmission, but that seasonality in transmission could substantially alter the timing and magnitude of the peak burden. Here, we propose to use this model to evaluate control and mitigation strategies for COVID-19. Guided by the World Health Organization-identified research priorities and PHE needs, we will estimate the impact of travel restrictions, border screening and quarantine policies. We will also assess the effects of social distancing measures and other non-pharmaceutical interventions on peak burden and epidemic timing and rank measures by effectiveness. The model will also be adapted to assess and rank pharmaceutical deployment strategies. Our vision is to make the model adaptable and available to other countries and settings, both with and without census and commuting data. Key challenges include modelling commuting patterns, incorporating realistic age structure, adding an observation model to capture morbidity and mortality and including behaviour change which could substantially alter dynamics.

The initial focus on in vivo models for COVID-19, based on experiences of establishing animal models for the pathogenic coronaviruses which cause SARS and MERS, were with ferret and non-human primate models. However, recent results from international laboratories working on SARS-CoV-2 have highlighted that hamsters show a more distinctive COVID19 disease with clinical signs associated with respiratory infection (rapid breathing, weight loss, ruffled fur). In addition to the clinical signs, hamsters have also been shown to shed SARS-CoV-2 and infect their naïve cage mates. Developing the means of establishing and investigating this natural challenge model will provide important and beneficial testing protocols that can be used evaluate prophylactic therapies and vaccines via a natural infection route under experimental conditions, within a carefully controlled containment level 3 (CL3) envelope. This capability will also enable investigations on transmissibility between animals and studies on different strains, including those SARS-CoV-2 viruses that may be engineered by molecular virology techniques to address questions on virus host interactions. Hamsters appear to offer a valuable disease model for COVID-19. Importantly, establishing the hamster model and associated techniques to evaluate interventions in the UK at the unique CL3 facilities of PHE-Porton, will also support a rapid intervention screening and in vivo research hub for the country on COVID-19. This will support UK industry and academia’s research need’s and evidence base to progress into clinical trials.	Medical Research Council	P&Cs	199984.0 GBP

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project. A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) originating in Wuhan, China has reached pandemic status and causes a disease termed COVID-19. Therapeutics and vaccines are urgently needed. The normal pace of new drug development is incompatible with strategies to rapidly combat COVID-19. Drug combinations with antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity will likely be essential to treat infected patients, as acute respiratory virus-induced disease is commonly mediated by inflammatory responses to infection. An alternative strategy to rapidly identify therapeutics to combat SARS-CoV-2 is drug repurposing. As the drugs are already FDA-approved, it is cost-effective and time-efficient. To this end, we will exploit MuSIC (multiplex screening of interacting compounds) screening of a unique library consisting of ~1,000 drugs to identify single and synergistic interacting compounds that have either SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity or anti-inflammatory activities, with limited/no toxicities. This library includes FDA-approved compounds and antiviral drugs that showed activity against other cornoviruses (SARS-CoV & MERS-CoV) (1). Drug candidates will be validated using SARS-CoV-2-infection of well-differentiated primary human airway epithelial cell cultures (WD-PAECs), which are excellent surrogates of human airway epithelium. WD-PAECs represent the most relevant pre-clinical translational model for screening therapeutic drugs for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 uses that same receptor/entry factors as SARS-CoV (2), which infects WD-PAEC cultures. Our findings will identify candidate drugs for treating COVID-19 patients, which can quickly enter clinical trials or be employed for compassionate use, especially in the case of viral diseases lacking specific treatments.

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project. With surging numbers of total confirmed cases and deaths, the UK has entered the most stringent social distancing stage in history. Of all the key worker groups, delivery workers is the one has most gig workers who are precariously employed. Huge spikes in demand have been reported by supermarkets, online grocers and food delivery services. The employers have responded by hiring more workers or requiring existing employees to work longer shifts. Certain epidemiological characteristics of the COVID-19, namely subclinical transmission, incubation period and varying viability on surfaces, present significant challenges to protect delivery workers. We aim to understand, based on different scenarios of risk mitigation measures and social distancing strategies, 1) how delivery workers contribute to the UK’s national response by delivering to households and hence reduce number of outgoing trips; and 2) how delivery workers could potentially contribute to transmission. We will collect data from key stakeholders of the sector to understand how the supply chains and delivery workers responded to the COVID19 outbreak and to build scenarios for mathematical modelling. Using these models we will assess the impact (positive and negative) of current delivery activities, as well as additional scenarios reflecting stricter lockdown conditions, taking into account effect of risk mitigation measures, by considering the number and nature of contacts they made in the communities (including vulnerable groups). Household transmission models will be used with external forcing into households and infection back to gig workers directly considered.	Medical Research Council	P&Cs	337913.0 GBP

This is both a short-term issue -- to cope with a huge increase in demand -- and a long-term issue as the crisis has exposed the fragility of international supply chains. Hybrisan has developed a biocidal electrospun nonwoven material than can be used as an alternative to current materials. The material can be used to make reusable, biocidal face masks that will improve safety of front-line workers and reduce the global shortage of face masks due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The aim of this project is to test and develop the nanofibre material for use in face masks, wound dressings and other uses. An InnovateUK grant will allow Hybrisan to rapidly develop and independently test the fabric for use in face mask applications. Hybrisan intends to manufacture the materials in the UK while also setting up international partnerships to produce finished products such as face masks, and is already in discussions with suppliers such as 3M. The vision is to create a series of unique, IP protected materials that can be manufactured in the UK and deployed globally to create supply security for the UK while also establishing a Welsh business as a global leader in manufacturing a new generation of anti-microbial products. The business is currently setting up in-house production facilities to enable UK-based material supply and is in discussions with partners for UK and worldwide production. This grant will allow Hybrisan to accelerate product development, by working with world-leading design and development consultancy TTP to carry out design development, independent testing, prototyping and production planning. We expect to develop the first prototypes within 3-4 months. Initial launch of the product is expected in Q3 2020, with full global production to start in early 2021 .

1103	QUALITY COMPLIANCE SYSTEMS LTD	QUALITY COMPLIANCE SYSTEMS LTD	None	None	None	Augmented Intelligence Guidance System for Carers	QCS is passionate about empowering those in the care sector. Experts in artificial intelligence agree that the future lies in augmented intelligence; intelligence that augments the human mind, not intelligence that replaces it. We are already market leaders in providing guidance and support to the care sector, we want to be able to make that expertise far more accessible to carers in every role in their organisation wherever they find themselves. Everyone deserves outstanding care at all times. Making the right decisions to ensure that can be a challenge at the best of times, but the current Covid-19 pandemic has the care sector facing its biggest ever challenge. The current rapidly changing environment has meant that carers often don't have the latest knowledge on what safety measures to take, what care to provide or what best practice protocols are. Imagine a world where a carer has an assistant in their smartphone which automatically keeps them up to date with relevant changes to policy and procedure in their native language guided by historical use, the specific needs of those that they care for and other carers with a similar profile. This will vastly increase carers' ability to make safer decisions and to dispense care with less time spent digging for information and more time spent caring. Carers will be assisted by a never sleeping, never tiring, never frustrated intelligence that empowers them to make better, safer, life-saving decisions. Critical information will reach these critical people at a critical time.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	49475.0 GBP
1104	REDGEAR SOLUTIONS LTD	REDGEAR SOLUTIONS LTD	None	None	None	Carer Assistance through Sensor Technology CAST	Through the CAST project, Redgear will deliver a solution that enables carers to give residents the care they need, remotely. Redgear Solutions use IoT technology to gain a better understanding of a person's behavior, health and well being by monitoring the environment around them. But for us it's not just about creating data. We are focused on equipping care teams with the information they need to make evidence-based decisions that benefit the people they care for. The added advantage during these difficult times of lock-down and isolation is that the system can be used entirely remotely, minimizing the spread of infection while still providing a high level of situational awareness. So far our sensor solution is being used with the largest provider of independent living villages in the UK. Daily reports for each resident inform care teams of the events of the previous 24 hours - allowing them to see the information they need at a glance. The goal is to create a solution that is un-intrusive which allows the resident to live more independently for longer. The CAST project seeks to expand the use of the solution, and particularly focus on helping those residents left most isolated by the pandemic. Once the system is installed, which takes less than 2 minutes, it can be used entirely remotely. This allows carers to 'check-in' on residents virtually and gain a greater understanding of how the resident is reacting to the isolation. Telephone contact will allow the care teams to discuss the issues raised via the system, and can be used to cross-reference any information the care team receives on the phone. Care teams can share the information they gather directly with family members - giving them greater peace of mind on their loved one's condition. In addition to the daily reports, automated alerts inform carers if anything abnormal has occurred - such as a lack of movement for extended periods, or unusual changes in their environment. This enables carers to react at speed to solve problems. The overall aim of the project is to equip carers with a solution that allows them to continue providing a high quality person-centered level of care, even though they are physically unable to be with residents. This has the simultaneous benefits of meeting the resident's care needs, whilst not exposing them to the risk of contracting COVID-19 .	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	44366.0 GBP
1105	GEO LIMITED	GEO LIMITED	None	None	None	Healthcare Protective Air Filtration	The use of conventional disposable surgical masks or FFP2 or FFP3 masks in critical care situations such as needed when treating covid-19 patients have disadvantages in use and in protecting users effectively. Correct fitting of disposable masks is a major issue, tests have shown efficiency of these types of masks can be reduced by over 30% due to facial hair or bad fitting around different face shapes. Wearing of these masks create breathing resistance and the build up of heat and moisture within the mask making them uncomfortable and unpleasant to wear particularly over extended periods of time. Indeed feedback from doctors has been highlighted on TV interviews working in critical covid -19 care situations where they have found it difficult to work for longer than 2 hours. Another issue highlighted by wearing these types of masks has made it difficult for doctors and nurses to communicate effectively, some reporting resorting to using walkie talkie radios to aid communication. Not being able to fully see the face makes recognition of the critical care worker difficult (hence the need to write the name and job function on PP gowns) and impossible to interpret facial expression and effective verbal communication. The protective air filtration system we are proposing uses guided air flows over the face to create a protective barrier from respiration of harmful contaminant particles providing increased protection factor over typical FFP2 and FFP3 masks. The air screen (generated behind a clear face guard) does not cover the face so it is fully visible, does not impede verbal communication and does not hide the face from view making interaction between care professionals much more fluid and natural. And the major benefit it does not cause discomfort from heat and moisture build up, but in fact creates a refreshing stream of air to breath keeping the user cool and calm. GEO ltd have simulated and physically tested using industry standard inward leakage test protocols to validate the air stream technology they have developed and have had results confirming performance equal to or better than best performing disposable masks and results which do not degrade performance due to facial shape of hair. GEO require funding to develop this technology into a viable commercial product. GEO are industrial design consultants that have worked on the successful design and development of many respiratory systems for clients delivering commercial PAPR and SCBA kit.

We will provide the tools to support monitoring and decision making for carers in the care setting. This provides carers with the tools to undertake both clinical assessments, such as NEWS2 and non-clinical assessments such as DENWIS (worry / concern assessment) and sepsis screening; with secondary care capacity being pushed to the limit, it is clearly essential to get the right balance to admit only those cases that require acute care, and safely monitor those with unscheduled care needs in the care setting. Specifically during the pandemic, this solution will help ensure those with critical need get they care they need when they need it. Xyron will build upon existing open source clinical tools that have been developed through an open way of working, utilising existing open standards around clinical data (openEHR). Our key objectives are to: * Develop a browser based application that provides carers access to non-clinical assessments that identify patient deterioration and/or COVID-19 and provides non-clinical teams with patient information that allows them to make critical decisions around patient care to safely monitor them in the care setting * Persist all clinical information using open standard (openEHR) to ensure handover is possible across health and care settings * Ensure the final developed software is available in perpetuity under the custodianship of the Apperta Foundation, with the clinical and non-clinical individuals who designed or uses it The project is innovative because it; * Addresses a key issue of "concern" raised by non-clinical carers and/or care staff and digitises serious illness assessments that have previously not been made available in a community or care setting. * Enables close collaboration with health care professionals, clinicians and technologists to ensure best practice; built to the Apperta Foundation Custodian Model principles, built using an open approach, released on an open source licence, made available in perpetuity under the custodianship of the clinical and health care teams that designed it.

The strategy of slowing the spread of COVID-19 across the nation through social distancing amongst other methods needs the public to listen and act to limit the spread of the virus, thus relieving the burden on NHS services. SPACER is a free to use app for the public designed to help combat COVID-19 and encourage people to follow government guidelines. The SPACER application aims to empower the public and support the Government's social distancing rules through building awareness and motivates users to maintain 2 metre distance from someone else outside of their household. Utilising Bluetooth modules within mobile phones, the application will determine accurate distance between individuals. As well as showing daily reports, the application whitelists devices so members belonging in the same household do not receive alerts. The app will detect when a user has returned to their "home" Wi-Fi, notifying the user to wash their hands. A key insights feature will provide tips to cope with anxieties with a focus on well-being. MIG's SPACER application prides itself on not storing or using any user's personal data, reassuring users that the application is designed to broaden awareness and help people adhere to government guidelines during this difficult time. The goal is that it will help alert people if they are within 2 metres of each other which aids preventing the mode of transmission and breaking the chain of infection.

Prior to the Coronavirus Pandemic, an early stage version of the product was being developed by a research team led by BUL in collaboration with the University of Lancaster and the University of Surrey and intended to be used for detecting viral pathogens in poultry, funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Science Research Council (BBSRC). The research team established that with some modification their product could use a Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assay to detect COVID-19 directly from a patient sample (nasal or throat swabs) within 30 minutes. Another strength of their design was that it analysed six samples per cycle and was being specifically developed for low-cost deployment in the developing world. A set of eight early stage products are currently undergoing laboratory and clinical validation studies at NHS Laboratories. The results of which will be used to further optimise the diagnostic algorithm and the physical design of the product. GBE will then assist with the manufacture of a batch of beta products, which will be a design iteration based on the initial trial units. This increases the amount of clinical trial data available and will provide essential feedback on the functionality of the product. The beta units will then undergo a significant 'cost-down' design for manufacture stage in order to prepare for mass production. This stage will involve refinement of the hardware, firmware and mechanical design plus development of a robust communications protocol. It will be manufactured in-house at GBE's Sussex based factory. All work will be carried out in conjunction with Brunel and their team in order to optimise the efficacy of the product. Whilst gathering additional functional data we will also prepare detailed market analysis to maximise the global and industrial potential of the product. With a keen focus on the needs of the developing world, where product cost is vital. GBE has over 30 years' experience of embedded product development and manufacturing. This includes a very successful track record within the healthcare market plus experience of working with innovative product launches and solutions.

The Covid-19 crisis has highlighted that there are many members of the community who are at risk. The elderly, vulnerable and socially isolated have always been there, but now more than ever they need help. We produce software for Local Authorities and Community Transport operators to provide efficient, cost effective transport for these often neglected members of our community, so we already understand their needs and vulnerabilities. We now have the opportunity to help, with funding from Innovate UK, by providing new ways for people to get the assistance they need and for the authorities to manage the delivery of essential supplies and other services in an efficient and cost effective way. The new software will provide multiple access channels for people to get what they need and allow the authorities to use innovative new methods of delivery. For telephone access, authority's call centres or home workers will have access to the system to register first time callers and place orders on their behalf. Internet access will be provided by simple to use online forms accessed through links on the authority's website. However, the most innovative access will be using Alexa smart speakers. These are already being rolled out by Local Authorities to combat social isolation and to assist the elderly and disabled, so the addition of new Alexa skills to provide direct access to urgent supplies and services will be of massive benefit at this difficult time, particularly for authorities already struggling with lack of staff resources to answer phone calls due to the pandemic. The software will also allow the authorities to utilise e-cargo bikes for the delivery of supplies by optimising routes specifically to extend their range.

1112	OPEN MEDICAL LTD	OPEN MEDICAL LTD	None	None	None	Pathpoint ITU- 'cloud' solution to triage, track and review intensive care patients	Intensive Treatment Unit (ITU) is the highest level of treatment for the most sick patients in society. Covid-19 is a novel infection with no known cure currently, leading to severe organ failure in the worst affected patients. Currently intensive care doctors are managing their highest number of patients in the history of the NHS. With high numbers of patients presenting to A&E departments, and quickly identified as needing urgent intensive treatment, many patients will be sent ('referred') to any site with capacity- which may not be in their immediate local area. If their health improves, they may be moved again to a designated centre for stabilised patients. With such high frequency movement of patients across different care settings and multiple staff involvement in patient care, our colleagues need a central system to track and review patient progress. We have served NHS 'acute' care for several years, and our experiences have led us to develop our 'Pathpoint ITU' tool for intensive care doctors. A secure web-based interface that gives doctors clear oversight of their daily workload, and enables any colleague who takes over the care of a patient to see the progress made so far, and the next steps required. This will help the national intensive care effort immensely. When a doctor or nurse logs into the secure portal, a dashboard of newly referred patients is presented to them. Information about the patient's disease, and any existing illnesses, is displayed. All essential information the intensive care unit requires has been prepared by the emergency department in advance of the patient's arrival. Every patient comes to ITU with the same mandatory information required. This information is the basis on which prioritisation ('triage') is enacted. A colour coding scheme, with highlighted 'tags', further enhances the triage process. Multiple times per shift, ITU departments need to decide on outcomes of patients: whether to admit a patient to ITU, to continue with high level monitoring outside ITU, or to safely discharge a patient. A fully governed intubation care record, containing clinical checklists and documentation that is accessible by all key clinical staff, is an essential part of the ITU toolkit. Key data is generated by the system throughout a patient's journey.This data is useful for clinical researchers when assessing flashpoints in the treatment of this novel disease; adding further value to the national Covid effort.

1113	PROAXSIS LTD	PROAXSIS LTD	None	None	None	A novel multiplex cytokine respiratory panel to change the dynamics of COVID-19 testing	There are a number of markers of inflammation which have been associated with various diseases. One group of such markers is the cytokines which are small proteins released by different cells in the body. These cytokines work as messengers and help co-ordinate the body's fight against infection and inflammation. Cytokines are often measured in the blood of patients with illnesses such as atherosclerosis and cancer. Very recently, a number of cytokines, such as interleukin-6, have been measured in patients infected with the COVID-19 virus and have been found to be significantly increased in those who have suffered worse symptoms and unfortunately, increased death rates. This is due to a 'cytokine storm' when the person's immune system goes into overdrive and becomes out of control. This leads to very high levels of cytokines being released which in turn causes excessive inflammation and even multiple organ damage. Cytokine storms may explain why some people have severe reactions to coronaviruses whilst others end up with only mild symptoms. For lung diseases such as COVID-19, it makes more sense to measure cytokine levels in sputum, as this will be more representative of what is occurring in the lungs themselves. Therefore, the aim of this project is to adapt the existing blood-based tests for three of the key cytokines, including interleukin-6, so that they can be safely and effectively measured in sputum samples. The project will use the extensive expertise of ProAxsis in the development of sputum-based tests to create a new combination test, which enables the level of three key cytokines - Interleukin-6, Interleukin-8 and Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha - to be measured in a small quantity of sputum. This will help healthcare professionals identify which patients infected with the COVID-19 virus are likely to suffer with the most severe symptoms. In the longer-term, it will also allow them to test the effectiveness of several of the new drugs being developed for the treatment of COVID-19 . ProAxsis will use two of its most experienced scientists to create this new sputum-based combination test within six months, and quickly move to expand its availability to other laboratories throughout the World. The company believes that this will provide a significant new tool for healthcare professionals in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	49982.0 GBP
1114	CYTOCHROMA LIMITED	CYTOCHROMA LIMITED	None	None	None	RAPID: a new test to identify the safety of new drugs and vaccines	Access to medicines and anti-viral vaccines would have significant societal, environmental and economic impacts, both in the short and long term. The current Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the inefficiency in how novel therapeutics are made and tested. New drug and vaccine development takes on average  >10 years, with costs in excess of 2 and 0.5 billion USD respectively. Latter stage therapeutics failures amount to over 90% in clinical trials, because predicting reactions in humans cannot be determined with current models and tests. Global pandemics are predicted to become more common, and subsequently, there is an increased and immediate need for 1) more accurate preclinical models, and 2) better, predictive tests to identify safety of drugs and vaccines. Cytochroma addresses the first need; by providing physiologically relevant, stem-cell-derived, human models for preclinical testing. We specialise in liver cell manufacture, a tissue that is often damaged and in which testing is required. We propose to address the second need and develop a more efficient method of testing the safety of new drugs and vaccines. This Robust Automated Phenotypic Identification of cell Damage or 'RAPID' test would use observational-based screening. By tagging cells with fluorescent dyes and viewing via a powerful microscope we can visualise how tissues react to drugs and vaccines at a single-cell level. This provides vastly more information than traditional tests and can be combined with machine learning to understand, modify and feedback to directly improve the development of new therapeutics. Cytochroma manufacturers liver models from a unique stem cell bank. These stem cells reflect a diverse genetic background that allows testing of a global population in vitro -- enabling identification of a _universal_ treatment for diseases. Our state-of-the-art technology and robotic based cell production can be easily adapted to tag cells and screen for toxicity on a high- content microscope. This automated approach enhances our capacity and enables us to provide cells at a scale and quality required for testing. These cells and the RAPID test will enable more accurate identification of toxicity, reduce late-stage attrition and accelerate development to make essential drugs and vaccines available faster. Cytochroma is based in Scotland, where over half of all Europe's biosafety is undertaken. The Company is well connected at all levels within the sector and it has strong relationships with several leading Contract Research Organisations and pharmaceutical giants, both of which offer an attractive route to market.

1115	ARQUER DIAGNOSTICS LIMITED	ARQUER DIAGNOSTICS LIMITED	None	None	None	Facilitating the adoption of a new bladder cancer diagnostic test to support the management of urology waiting times post-COVID-19 lockdown	This project will focus on the introduction of a novel technology to assist NHS in the stratification of urology patients (to ensure a quick diagnosis of patients at highest risk of having a bladder tumour). In the aftermath of COVID-19, patients presenting to NHS urology clinics will not be able to be prioritised with current tools. Arquer Diagnostics have a new Bladder Cancer Test (ADXBLADDER) which can be used to support the stratification of patients', thanks to its ability to rule out high risk tumours with a 98.7-99% certainty. Those patients with a negative test result have a very low chance of having a high risk tumour meaning they can safely delay having the invasive tests at the urology clinics, whilst those at high risk can be prioritised. Through this project a clinical team will be deployed by Arquer Diagnostics to identify those hospitals most in need of this stratification tool and to provide technical expertise for the installation of the test into NHS diagnostic laboratories. The team will also disseminate the relevant clinical and technical information to the NHS Urologists. These activities will provide NHS with a reliable stratification tool so that all the patients delayed during the COVID-19 crisis will be attended to with a strong clinical rationale, reducing the delay faced by those patients at highest risk, allowing these high risk tumours to be identified earlier and therefore improving their outcome.

1116	EMBERS THE DRAGON LTD	EMBERS THE DRAGON LTD	None	None	None	Getting school ready with the Keiki Island Kids	Following the school closures required to reduce the spread of Covid-19 we are facing an unprecedented difficultly in September when thousands of four year old's will start primary school without being school ready. Due to social distancing it is predicted that children will experience unusually high levels of attachment anxiety, lack of physical readiness such as coordination skills and toileting and an increased difficulty in pro-social and educational attainment skills like concentration and turn taking. This is of serious concern as School readiness is shown to provide the foundations for a child's education with the school readiness gap at five years old explaining 40 per cent of the attainment gap at the end of secondary school. Due to the pandemic an innovative digital approach is needed to try and replace the school transition work that would have been completed during the build up to the summer and lessen the school readiness gap. We will create a high quality animation for children, explaining the process of transition and replacing the work that would have been completed in nursery settings as well as a number of downloadable resources for parents and which can be sent out by schools to consolidate the learning. These will sit as part of our innovative platform, Embers the Dragon, which uses a blend of creative expertise and clinical expertise to create child development programs that can scale at mass. All of the resources included in the package are written by clinical and educational experts and underpinned by current best practice and evidence. With no digital school readiness program available in the UK this project will be essential to ensuring there is not a secondary crisis of childhood development as a result of Covid-19	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	49673.0 GBP
1117	EM SCIENTIFIC LIMITED	EM SCIENTIFIC LIMITED	None	None	None	A rapidly scalable, differentiated COVID-19 antibody/immunity test for mass-testing: proof of concept.	Our innovation is the development of a new test for COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 human antibodies to detect immunity. The test is rapidly scalable, highly automated, can be readily transferred and standardised across multiple instruments, manufacturers and laboratories. It has high inherent specificity and sensitivity in contrast to existing tests, reducing the false positive and false negative rate. To our knowledge, this is the first targeted mass spectrometry test for SARS-CoV-2 immunity. The test is also complementary to existing point-of-care and future immunoassays as it uses different set of consumables, instrumentation, laboratories and scientists with different skillsets. This expands the UK's immunity testing capacity under UK government's testing strategy Pillar 3 and 5 . Our vision is the test's application to vaccine development and mass-testing in the UK and US, rolled out this summer from several central laboratories which is how mass PCR-testing is conducted currently. The key objectives of the project include implementing this test in one of our laboratories and assessing its diagnostic accuracy and reliability using confirmed COVID-19 blood samples. This would enable us to work with Public Health England (_PHE_) or Innovative New Diagnostics foundation (FIND) to assess the performance of this test in a larger cohort of samples, including asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases, ahead of adoption for mass-testing. The focus of this project is to demonstrate our method is capable of quantifying human SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and meets diagnostic and technical performance metrics in the initial cohort of blood samples. Once this test is set up, it can be readily adapted to other antigens/coronaviruses for future outbreaks. Due to the high level of automation the costs of this test reduce significantly upon scaling, meaning it is well suited to cost-effective mass testing. We will also adapt this platform to develop other clinical tests in other disease areas.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	49907.0 GBP
1118	AIRCURY LTD	AIRCURY LTD	None	None	None	Quiz Carousel - building learning resilience in the face of COVID-19	Quiz Carousel is a digital application to help students embed knowledge into their long-term memory while enabling pupil-teacher feedback. This is particularly relevant during the current lockdown when things that have been taught may be quickly forgotten, but the product is also urgently needed longer-term to facilitate homework, revision and embedding learning. The concept is well-researched and evidence based. There has been a welcome focus on the importance of a knowledge rich curriculum in recent years, and academic literature shows that taking memory tests improves long-term retention (a concept known as the testing effect). The product is based on an idea developed several years ago by science teacher Adam Boxer and prototyped in an Excel-based system called Retrieval Roulette. Adam's learning and feedback from a highly engaged teacher community of users has been incorporated into the new Quiz Carousel product, and he continues to lead on teacher engagement and customer voice. Quiz Carousel works as follows: 1. **Teachers upload carefully sequenced questions** covering a whole curriculum. 2. **Students take quizzes** combining questions from both recent and earlier curriculum areas, using adaptive learning and spaced repetition algorithms to select questions. Answers can be viewed as flashcards. 3. **The system auto-marks where possible**, reducing the work burden for teachers. 4. **Teachers offer feedback** on misconceptions and incorrect answers. We are committed to ensuring that a version of Quiz Carousel is available for free, forever. Longer-term we expect to build in paid-for features that enhance the learning experience. Quiz Carousel will play an important role in helping students to embed learning now more than ever, given its suitability for learning at distance. We offer a simple and easy-to-use way for schools and students to remain in contact through these difficult times, as well as a tool to help lock key curriculum knowledge into the long-term memory once things return to normal.

1119	CORPORATION POP LTD	CORPORATION POP LTD	None	None	None	Xploro: using gamification to amplify the child patient’s voice and monitor symptoms during times of crisis	**Increased need due to Covid-19:** Children with chronic diseases (~1.8m in UK) are having a particularly difficult time during the current crisis, with heightened fears of infection, little or no contact with support workers, restrictions on visitors whilst in hospital and harder to access healthcare services. For those that are immuno-compromised (eg. cancer patients) the situation is especially difficult. With the need for self-isolation and an NHS pushed to breaking point, it is vitally important that mechanisms are developed to enhance remote patient reporting for children at home and minimise face-to-face interactions. Capturing the child patient's voice at these times of crisis is crucial. Evidence from multiple pediatric cancer studies has demonstrated that clinicians and caregivers underreport the number and severity of symptoms compared with self?reports from children. _"If the child's voice is overlooked, the true impact of the therapies they are receiving cannot be fully and accurately known. The risk is that therapy decisions will be made, based on well-meaning but incomplete information, and that we will not learn the full impact of the treatments we are delivering to similarly diagnosed children. We need a streamlined, appealing way to collect the relevant subjective symptom and treatment toxicity reports from children in a systematic manner such that the ill child's voice will not be overlooked or forgotten._ _We also need this way of collecting such essential data to be consistently available to the ill child, unaffected by the constraints of the pandemic."_ Pam Hinds, Executive Director of Nursing, Children's National Clinical Center. Through the development of innovative additional functionalities that facilitate the capturing of patient feedback, Corporation Pop (a Manchester-based SME) will tailor their Xploro App (designed to empower young-patients with information) to the new challenges that the Covid-19 epidemic is presenting. **IMPACTS** Make UK healthcare delivery more resilient when faced with similar disruptions. Benefits for patients (more engaged, better outcomes), their families/guardians (fewer hospital visits, happier children), and clinicians (time saving, improved understanding of therapeutic impact).

1120	SETL LIMITED	SETL LIMITED	None	None	None	The Citizen Wallet	The Covid 19 Crisis has accelerated the need for certain technologies to be brought into mainstream use. One of those technologies is verifiable credentials. Verifiable credentials are digitally signed certificates that can be verified simply and quickly both in person and over the internet. Examples of possible deployment include prioritising older or vulnerable people's use of online supermarket delivery slots or certifying medical tests results to allow people to work in specialist medical roles or make use of air travel. This would be operated on the basis of a digital certificate issued by one or more trusted authorities. W3C recently released standards for the format of these certificates to encourage an interoperating eco system of credentials issuers, holders and verifiers. The vision for this project is to implement a framework that allows this new standard to be used but also connects to existing identity technology so that its use can be quickly scaled. The aim will be to create an environment where credentials can be easily issued and checked using web and mobile technologies. It should be usable at both a local and global level. For example a local authority would be able to issue credentials which can be read by a local welfare service provider to assist prioritisation, while a national government may use it for travel permissions. The environment will include a permissioned distributed ledger of credentials that will facilitate the issuing, holding, asserting and verification of the credentials. The environment will maintain credentials in W3C format and in X.509 format to allow bridging to existing identity environments. The distributed ledger will not use costly proof-of-work algorithms typically associated with this technology, and therefore not have the associated negative environmental impact. The main area of focus will be to create a system that can be used to store and deploy verifiable credentials using the new W3C standard. This will be interoperable with other systems using the same standard and will be part of an ecosystem that will allow credentials such as medical test results, key worker status or verified vulnerability status to be widely used in both physical and online environments.

1122	THE TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH CENTRE LIMITED	THE TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH CENTRE LIMITED	None	None	None	Development of a Low-Cost, Small Footprint, Point-of use, Hand & Forearm Sanitisation Station utilising tap water.	Infection Prevention & Control (IPC) is an NHS high priority, further heightened by the Covid-19 pandemic. The main pillars of IPC are use of PPE and rigorous hand hygiene. The preferred hand sanitisation method is handwashing (anti-microbial soap & water, rinse, dry with paper towels ~30 seconds total time) which achieves log 3 microbial inactivation. Alcohol gels are fast and convenient, but frequent use leads to dry/cracked skin that increases infection risk. Effectiveness varies with alcohol content & types; less effective than hand washing achieving < log 2 inactivation. Covid-19 has rendered supplies scarce due to greater demand and reduced production. Our proposed system uses activated water vapour to achieve sanitisation from tap water at point of need, generating water vapour entrained in a flowing air-stream. This air-water vapour stream is then ducted to a delivery manifold to 'fog' user's hands/wrists/forearms -- providing effective disinfection within 15 seconds.

1123	MACE LIMITED	MACE LIMITED	None	None	None	Offsite Accelerator for SMEs	**The project proposes an 'Offsite Accelerator' for SMEs** Supporting the UK construction SME supply chain to increase work offsite to meet the demands of the Construction Leadership Council's (CLC) 'Site Operating Procedures' for safe working amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. In the case of the construction industry, the Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted how the usual way of construction work -- a highly transient, high population workforce that mobilises to sites, and moves between sites on a weekly basis - is largely unsustainable, especially for the SME supply chain. The reliance on site-based labour increases movements to and from sites and makes working whilst maintaining social distancing close to impossible. With postponed operations likely to affect the workforce for months, SMEs are in an extremely vulnerable position, and unlikely to be able to support their workforces through this period. This project creates a catalyst opportunity to drive innovation into SME supply chains and transform towards flexible, resilient, offsite focused delivery models which allow individuals or small teams within SMEs to progress works whilst keeping safe. However, cashflow, experience and expertise are still out of reach for SMEs Our Offsite Accelerator will leverage Mace's highly experienced technical, design, delivery and commercial resources to help SMEs shift towards Modern Methods of Construction (MMC) business models through collaborative development and trial of offsite sub-assemblies. In the short term, adopting offsite methods will enable SMEs to return to work faster and continue to work during Covid19 restrictions. In both the short and long-term, the project aims to divert 30% of labour away from sites to maintain social distancing, and move towards a more resilient business model that meets both the needs of the industry and the wider needs of society.

1124	ONKOLYZE LTD	ONKOLYZE LTD	None	None	None	with artificial intelligence to detect covid-19 in 2D lung ultrasound scans and quantify the severity of the disease	**Public overview** This project is to augment ultrasound as a screening tool with artificial intelligence to detect covid-19 symptoms in lung ultrasound scans and help doctors understand how risky patients are. It can also be used to monitor the progression of a patients' disease. CT scanning has been shown to outperform some of the other diagnostic tests to diagnoses corona virus but when a patient needs to be taken for an X-ray or CT scan, they are at risk for spreading the disease to other patients and the other doctors who look after them. Doctors in Italy found that corona virus can be detected using lung ultrasound. Ultrasound is a very portable way of checking patients' lungs and it can also be operated easily by nurses when a patient first comes into the hospital to decide how risky the patient is. Ultrasound can also be used next to the patient's bedside. This means decisions can be made quickly whilst the patient is not as exposed to other patients and / or doctors and so helps with both treatment for the individual patient and infection control. The current issue with lung ultrasound is that the image must still be analysed by a person, and people make mistakes, take time to do things, and get tired. If an algorithm can work alongside the doctors and nurses, it will improve the speed and quality of their work. This project has three objectives: 1. To prove that corona virus can be automatically detected in lung ultrasound images 2. To find a way to market this product 3. To find a hospital to help supply data and demonstrate the algorithm works If this project is successful, this can potentially be a very useful tool to help doctors and nurses do a lot more with less resources. Making lung ultrasound more useful for doctors can be very helpful in the fight against this corona virus pandemic. As this project is software based, it will be very easy for other hospitals and care providers to take advantage of the benefits. This is also potentially very useful for more rural healthcare settings where the expertise to interpret these images may not be easy to access.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	46792.0 GBP

The UK government reported transport use is down by more than 60% for all transport types since February. Rail and Tube use are down by 97%  [Coronavirus press conference: 15 April 2020 ]. This is having significant impact on operators' revenue and commercial viability  [TfWM, 2020 ]. Operators have significant financial and societal motivation to bring passenger numbers and revenues up again asap, but gradually, once lockdown starts to step down whilst maintaining social distance on trams/trains. Accelogress proposes to develop and demonstrate an innovative public transport service resource management solution as an extension to our best-in-class existing Save-a-Space (SAS) real-time parking management platform, to be deployed initially at the Midlands Metro tram (6m passengers in 2018/2019) in partnership with TfWM. Such an approach was also suggested elsewhere, acknowledging that "Criteria and strategies" need to be developed "for a gradual return to normality beyond the acute restrictions that have been imposed on basic rights such as the freedom of movement," the researchers at the Leopoldina National Academy of Sciences in Germany write in a position paper. Furthermore: "... Travel, both business and private, could also be resumed under those circumstances. The scientists recommend that the greatest possible distance needs to be created between people on trains, planes and buses and that masks should be worn covering the mouth and nose. In the case of German national railway Deutsche Bahn ... the company could establish a reservation system that ensures that a certain number of rows of seats between passengers are kept free."

1127	256 KELVIN LIMITED	256 KELVIN LIMITED	None	None	None	Video chat for the elderly	Older adults often struggle with video chat, and this has become especially apparent to families the length and breadth of the United Kingdom during the Covid-19 pandemic. While younger adults turned to Skype, Zoom and other products to stay connected, an overwhelming number of older adults who have not embraced technology have been left with no visitors and little social interaction. One key reason for this is that many commercial video suppliers require people to sign up, install apps and navigate various complicated options. These options and steps, while second nature to people of the smartphone generation, present significant difficulties to older adults and often lead to frustration, which in turn leads to less communication with loved ones and their wider support network. We are developing online software in which every decision is focussed on ease of use. There will be no required sign-up, no complex features like screen-sharing, no address books and, critically, a user interface that does not resemble a mission control room.

1128	CAPTAIN AI TECHNOLOGIES LTD	CAPTAIN AI TECHNOLOGIES LTD	None	None	None	Fleet Sharing - Enabling restaurants and small businesses to effortlessly share their delivery drivers with each other	The world has dramatically changed with Covid-19 . Many small businesses, especially restaurants, have been financially affected with the lockdown. In order to keep afloat, many local businesses are now fully dependent on delivering goods to local customers. However, many are faced with the problem of not having their own drivers to deliver. This is especially true in rural areas or small towns where there is no access to third party delivery providers. At the same time, businesses who have hired their own delivery drivers are unable to use them as efficiently as possible. We want to enable local businesses to continue operating efficiently by building an online driver sharing marketplace. The **Captain Driver Marketplace** would be an easy to use cloud-based website and mobile app where a local business can make a request for a driver from another business to perform a delivery. This request would be sent out to all nearby local businesses that have available drivers. These businesses would provide an instant quote to perform the delivery. Drivers would perform delivery jobs using a mobile app that has all the information needed to perform the delivery. Our project aims to: 1) empower small local businesses, such as independent restaurants, convenience stores, pharmacies, groceries, local retailers who desperately need drivers to access them 2) increase utilisation of employed delivery drivers by enabling them to be shared with other businesses thus increasing their financial return 3) increase the overall ability of the market to perform deliveries of all types and even out peaks and troughs in demand by allowing delivery drivers of one industry to perform deliveries for another industry, eg. a pizza delivery driver to perform a grocery delivery. Our project would be pioneering the first business-to-business driver marketplace in the UK. This will be specifically built for restaurants and businesses who perform on-demand deliveries. We hope to create revenue opportunities for small businesses, increase employment opportunities for drivers and prevent many small businesses from shutting down.

1131	IGEOLISE LIMITED	IGEOLISE LIMITED	None	None	None	Covid-19 transport travel times	TravelTime Technologies have already built and commercialised a technology platform, accessed by API, that enables clients in 40 countries to analyse their own data by travel time, not distance. As one example, the NHS use our platform to determine where to locate health facilities within reach of an optimum population. However, Covid has changed travel times dramatically as mainline and underground stations have closed, bus and train timetables have changed, and road speeds have increased. This means that when planning the location of Covid testing centres (for example) 'Covid travel times' mean far more than 'normal travel times'. We've had multiple requests for a 'Covid TravelTime API' from government departments, NGOs, charities, health services and other organisations who are on the front-line tackling Covid. In response we have already mirrored our existing platform and in early May we will start testing our 'Covid TravelTime API'. We will deliver it free of charge to these front-line services, irrespective of their API usage. We believe this will be the only such API in the world and it will, without doubt, save lives. After Covid, when travel times return to normal, we will repurpose this 'mirror' API so that transport planners can use it to model the impact of proposed new transport infrastructure on the existing road, rail, bus and subway networks. What's innovative about this proposal is; 1) it builds upon an already patented, innovative and existing TravelTime platform without which the 'Covid TravelTime API' could not be built. 2) There is no equivalent 'Covid TravelTime API anywhere in the world. 3) our current API already is, and the Covid TravelTime API will be, available as a plug and play solution within the dominant GIS (Geographic Information Services) of Arcgis from ESRI, Alteryx, and the opensource QGIS -- there are few data planners in the front line teams battling Covid who don't use one (or more) of these GIS services. It means our API will instantly be available at a click of a button (literally) for just about everyone in the front-line organisations asking for it. And 4) post covid, when we repurpose the API for future infrastructure planning, again, nearly all transport planners use one or more of these GIS applications and we will have a ready route to market.

1132	CURIOSITY LEARNING LTD	CURIOSITY LEARNING LTD	None	None	None	Curiosity in the home	In difficult times we often look towards our schools and our teachers and think of them as a pillar of strength and stability. But who supports them? Curiosity does. It is a well-established platform that schools deploy to engage children age 9 to 14 . Using a 3,000 year timeline, pupils take a journey choosing moments, events and topics that interest them. They pick _Challenges_ and complete them in a way that they find appropriate. Once completed, the _Challenges_ are submitted and the teachers engage with each child in a 1 to 1 tutorial style discussion using the comprehensive resources that Curiosity provides. The students log in through their own personal dashboard to plan the next steps on their journey and choose new _Challenges_. The teacher logs in to monitor and record student progress and to access the resources. Curiosity is a hit with teachers (particularly as there is no lesson preparation) and a hit with students since they work at their own pace, in a manner they choose on a Challenge they have selected. From September 2020, Curiosity will be available on a free of charge extended trial basis to over a thousand schools across England and, in light of the recent Covid-19 experience, we would now like to upgrade the platform and build in functionality so that it can more easily be used by teachers as a way of communicating and providing exciting learning opportunities to pupils in their homes. We would like pupils and teachers to be able to easily maintain contact by way of seamless video assessments and chats and we would like also to expand the timeline topics so that additional curriculum areas are covered. This will build a stronger, more dynamic teacher/pupil relationship . Curiosity _Challenges_ are all cross-curricula, carefully crafted, and develop essential life-skills across seven key areas: numeracy, literacy, research, experimentation, communications, visualisation and memory. They are all able to be approached from anywhere along the ability spectrum and undertaken at a speed and in a way that each individual student finds appropriate to themselves. Curiosity used in the home environment will empower teachers without adding to their workload and gives pupils and teachers the ability to instantly access remote working functionality. Teachers and pupils will benefit from classroom-built familiarity and, with the broad and rich learning that Curiosity provides, it will help to develop a life-long love of learning.

PWC estimates the year one impact on UK GDP could range between -4% and -8%. Further, they suggest the worst-hit sectors such as transport, hotels and food service, could see their annual output down by anything from around 15% to around 40%.[][0] [1 ] The pressure to resume business and life as normal is a growing challenge for governments globally but public health advisors are highlighting that restrictions on daily life need to continue until a vaccine is widely available. The so-called Exit Strategy from the current lockdown is likely to comprise a gradual lifting of restrictions for certain groups e.g. by age and possibly for certain areas where numbers are deemed to have peaked. A range of tools will be required to support the gradual lifting of restrictions. With the support of Innovate UK, this project will involve the fast track design and manufacture of a mass-market innovative personal protection device to lower the risk of contracting COVID-19 and future viruses. This project has resulted from the government call for manufacturers to consider diversifying production to meet the urgent need for personal protective equipment in the UK. O'Neills is a multi-sports manufacturer specialising in the design and manufacture of bespoke playing and training kit to teams globally. O'Neills is ideally placed to deliver this project as a vertically integrated manufacturer with in-house skills in product development, and a wide range of apparel and product manufacturing equipment. We have a strong supply chain in place for the core raw materials to be used in this project.

1134	CAMBRIDGE MEDICAL ACADEMY LTD	CAMBRIDGE MEDICAL ACADEMY LTD	None	None	None	BACKLOG - Bridging the Appointments backlog, post COVID-19 through re-LOcation of urban and rural clinical service delivery	BACKLOG will produce a secure cloud-based geospatial (location, distance, and transport) context aware resource and appointment allocation decision support service to aid the NHS and public health service providers safely and effectively clear the backlog of outpatient and small interventions which have occurred due to the COVID-19 crisis. The complexity of scheduling and managing this backlog is immense as the traditional appointment scheduling systems available to service leaders do not take into account the short-term, third-party, and mobile resources being made available in light of the COVID-19 response. The scheduling systems also do not take into account patient separation, availability of "clean" clinics, and the mobility of the patients. The BACKLOG system will integrate location-allocation models to the existing IT appointment and scheduling (ERP) systems and will impact medical practitioners and patients by improving their safety, reducing the potential COVID-19 touch points; allowing for a safe and efficient reduction in the patient backlog ensuring effective prioritisation of cases. This will give communities a sense of returning to normality by being able to carry on business as usual, ensuring the return to normality does not increase road and hospital traffic, by ensuring all patients are sufficiently spaced and will reduce environmental CO2 by finding appointments that may be closer or accessible via public transport. The effectiveness of BACKLOG will be tested by supporting the reestablishment of the Royal Papworth Hospital's oximetry diagnostics services once COVID-19 related restrictions are lifted. Typically, more than 10,000 oximetry tests are carried out in the community. Since routine service provision was suspended on 19th March 2020 the backlog of tests is growing by 195 a week or 868 a month. BACKLOG will aim to reduce the waiting list of sleep services appointments by 25% and the time to eliminate the excess waiting list by 4 months.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	49518.0 GBP
1135	CHARACTER COUNTS LTD	CHARACTER COUNTS LTD	None	None	None	EasyPeasy Home Learning content task-force: Supporting families with young children	EasyPeasy requests £46,867 in matched funding (£23k already secured) to support a 3-month content task-force to become the go-to early years app for parents and teachers during the COVID-19 crisis, and beyond. The home environment has a greater influence on children's early development than full time centre-based childcare. Despite this, home learning is an under-developed market and support is lacking for the 2.5 million parents with children aged 0-5 across the UK. Already existing developmental gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged children will widen as a result of lockdown with inequalities in home learning environment no longer mitigated by centre-based care. There is a significant need to provide support, guidance and encouragement to families to ensure they stay happy, healthy, and well, and to support children's ongoing learning and development throughout social distancing. At the same time, widespread school and nursery closures threaten the survival of the early years sector, and the need to support the ecosystem to innovate and adapt to distance learning is paramount. EasyPeasy is a child development platform that offers parents activities and guidance to turn everyday parenting stresses into opportunities for playful learning. It is the only digital platform of its kind with proven impact on both children's cognitive development and parents' wellbeing through Randomised Control Trial evaluation, with observable benefits to families across culture and socio-economic background in 10-18 weeks of use. EasyPeasy is a partner of the Department of Education, delivering proven impact through the government's Early Years Social Mobility Programme. As well as offering free access to EasyPeasy for parents and teachers across Q2 2020, through this project we will accelerate development of new functionality on our platform to support user-generated content, and work with nurseries, schools, and children's charities to adapt and digitise their programmes and curriculum so they can continue supporting their local communities, and work towards new and sustainable delivery models.

1137	GRADLIST LTD	GRADLIST LTD	None	None	None	Pool Your Learning	We are a recruitment marketplace specialising in junior job seekers and graduates. Our project idea is to create a bridge for job seekers who are struggling to start a promising career in the present climate. We will deliver a unique range of study courses for graduates, developed in collaboration with employers, targeting the "soft learning" that graduates experience on their first job. Task-oriented, technical training programs exist already, but graduate trainees struggle with problems like communication style, interpreting instructions and anticipating the needs of their colleagues. We will offer assessed coursework focussing on these "soft skills". Rather than charging for the training, we will offer it free, and we will profit from the goodwill and value that it adds to our recruitment marketplace in the longer term. Graduates who participate will have their work scored by us and by our community of employers. While we hope to see the extinction of the coronavirus soon, the lingering economic effects of the virus are likely to hurt graduates more than most. During these difficult times, we want to give satisfying and meaningful opportunities to graduates and to support them on the first steps of their careers. We will deliver novel, practical courses to "simulate" the soft-learning that graduates and junior staff experience during their first job. For the duration of the COVID-19 crisis, our platform [TalentPool.com][0] will be refocussed on connecting junior-level job seekers with online training opportunities. The nature of this training would be practical tasks, carried out online and relevant to the job areas in which the candidate is interested in working in. The aims of this project are two-fold: 1. To equip job seekers with the skills and knowledge they need to increase their chances of getting hired both during the crisis and after. 1. To support businesses (especially our traditional subscriber base of SMEs) who are hiring during the crisis by helping them to train their new starters in tasks that they would otherwise, in more normal circumstances, learn on the job. This could help maintain employment levels if remote working continues indefinitely. The societal impact of the project would be to keep UK job seekers engaged and competitive while hiring remains on hiatus. Up-skilling junior-level job seekers not only increases their long-term employability, but it also puts UK business in a stronger position to bounce back from the crisis.

1138	BRIGHT DIGITAL MARKETING LTD	BRIGHT DIGITAL MARKETING LTD	None	None	None	Enabling virtual public consultations for large-scale infrastructure projects	Planning applications, particularly those for large-scale projects like wind farms or solar power developments, require public consultations before they receive planning consent. Current Covid-19 safety measures make public gatherings impossible, leading to delays in the consultation and planning process. Without intervention, this would lead to delays in renewable energy construction and, ultimately, undermine the UK's ability to hit its ambitious net zero carbon target. Our solution brings these public consultations into the virtual world, allowing community members to examine plans and ask questions from the comfort of their home. We intend to retain all of the benefits of a real-world consultation, from the presentation materials through to the one-on-one and group discussions with the developers and independent experts. With the support of Innovate UK, our project will help to ensure that the UK comes out of this pandemic with infrastructure planning complete, signed off and ready for action.

Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection range from asymptomatic, mild, moderate, to severe infections,resulting in ICU hospitalization and even death. In the US alone, there is a prediction of ~100,000 – 240,000deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infections. There is an urgent need to immunophenotype patients with COVID todefine biomarkers of disease severity and outcome to inform new interventions to prevent or treat this deadlydisease. Key to characterizing the human immune response to SARS-CoV-2, is recruitment , enrollment andretention of a cohort of study participants with COVID. To this end, we will employ best practices in clinicalresearch to pursue three Specific Aims (SAs). In SA1, we will recruit and enroll a well-defined cohort of adultswith SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19); in SA2, we will obtain and store biosamples from patients in this COVID-19cohort in support the NIAID immunophenotyping effort and in SA3 we will partner with the Clinical & DataCoordinating Center (CDCC) to provide clinical data from this COVID-19 cohort to ensure these samples arehighly annotated with key clinical data.Overall, successful pursuit of these SAs will provide well defined clinical samples and high qualityclinical data to support the NIAID COVID immunophenotyping effort.

SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are frequently asymptomatic, but initialepidemiologic estimates from the WHO indicate that ~15% of patients develop severe disease including viralpneumonia often requiring ICU care due to progression to develop life-threatening complications including (butnot limited to) shock and secondary organ failures, and super-infections. Risk factors for increased mortality fromCOVID-19 include older age, COPD, ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and immunosuppression.Although direly needed, no targeted therapies or vaccinations are available as of now. Major research effortshave been launched towards the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, including those within BostonChildren’s Hospital’s Precision Vaccines Program. To facilitate and accelerate these therapy and vaccinationdevelopment efforts, more detailed immunophenotyping and understanding of the host immune response toSARS-CoV-2 are required. This knowledge may inform prognostication of resolution of infection versus diseaseprogression and identify the relevant targets for potential therapeutic interventions. Overall, the outcomes ofthese immunophenotyping maps are critical for identifying and prioritizing host-directed interventions to limit ormitigate disease progression. Based on this rationale, we hypothesize that plasma proteomics and metabolomicsfrom hospitalized COVID-19 patients, longitudinally collected during the hospital stay and during the subsequentconvalescence period of up to one year post-discharge from the hospital will provide much needed insights intothe intricacies of the immunophenotype of COVD19 patients. Thus, they will be crucial to support NIAID’s effortstowards enabling and accelerating therapy and vaccine development. To this end, we propose a Proteomics andMetabolomics Core (PMC) to support NIAID’s efforts to characterize at the molecular and cellular level theimmunophenotype associated with COVID-19.The PMC will quantitative map the global plasma proteome (Specific Aim 1) and the global plasma metabolome(Specific Aim 2), followed by hypothesis-driven targeted metabolomics to detect metabolites and metabolicpathways that play a role in the COVID-19 disease progression (Specific Aim 3). All plasma samples will belongitudinally collected from COVID-19 patients upon hospitalization and the following 28 days in the hospital aswell as the subsequent convalescence period of up to 12 months after discharge.We anticipate that the PMC will make substantial contributions to confronting the new COVID-19 pandemic, forwhich therapeutic strategies and vaccines must be developed rapidly. The PMC will help portray a broad profileof the changes that occur in COVID-19 patients and that are associated with disease severity, progression andrecovery to support the quest for anti-COVID-19 therapies and vaccines.

Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection range from asymptomatic, mild, moderate, to severe infections,resulting in ICU hospitalization and even death. In the US alone, there is a prediction of ~100,000 – 240,000deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infections. There is an urgent need to 1) characterize the host innate and adaptiveresponse to SARS-CoV-2 and 2) to define immunologic biomarkers that can inform new approaches fordiagnostic, prognostic, therapeutic and preventative (e.g., vaccine) modalities in order to improve our ability totreat and prevent disease.To enhance the efficiency of immuophenotyping, the Precision Vaccines Program (PVP) has optimized a numberof sample-sparing in vitro assays to characterize both innate and adaptive immune function. These establishedassays will be applied to the evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 infections and identification of biomarkers associatedwith morbidity and mortality, which remains an unmet need and a research priority for the fight against COVID.Through investigating soluble and cellular innate and adaptive immune mediators, we will gain insight into thecontrol of inflammation and infection in COVID. In Specific Aim 1 (SA1), we will measure, eg, (a) the plasmaenzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA) that metabolizes the anti-inflammatory metabolite adenosine to theimmunologically inert inosine, thereby enhancing Th1 immune responses and enhancing antiviral innate andadaptive immunity; and (b) human defensins, antimicrobial peptides that enhance innate antiviral (e.g., IFN) andneutralizing antibody (Ab) responses to coronaviruses. In SA2, we will employ system serology, to furthercharacterize Ab function and efficiency to SARS-CoV-2 across the severity of infection. In SA3, we will measureresponses of whole blood leukocytes to activation of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) as well asresponses of T-cell co-cultures to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antigen.Overall, successful completion of the proposed IMPACC Local Assay Site studies will provide unique insightsinto human innate and adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in relation to COVID progression andprognosis. These insights will provide fresh approaches to develop diagnostics, therapeutics and preventativemeasures against COVID-19, including vaccines.

The outbreak of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection is spreading toevery continent around the world at an astonishing speed. As of April 15, 2020, coronavirus disease2019 (COVID-19) has been confirmed in 2,035,764 people worldwide, causing a mortality of 6.42%,exceeding far beyond a mortality rate of &lt;1% from influenza. Effective treatment is urgently needed tostop the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this devastating pandemic. While current focus is ondeveloping novel therapeutics including antivirals and vaccines, mounting evidence show that manysevere COVID-19 patients suffer from respiratory failure by acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS), the leading cause of COVID-19 mortality. In this study, we aim to address this majorunmet medical need. Clinically, host cells elicit two-phased responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Inan early incubation and non-severe stage, immune cells such as macrophages detect the virus andproduce cytokines to eliminate the virus. But, when a protective immune response is impaired, thevirus propagates, and the disease is transitioned to a severe stage where innate inflammation isinduced by virus-caused massive tissue damage with uncontrolled cytokine release (aka CytokineStorm) from inflammatory macrophages and granulocytes, resulting in ARDS in the lungs. Ascendedpro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, GM-CSF, MCP-1, IFN-γ, and TNF-α arereported in severe COVID-19 patients. Lung hyper-inflammation is the main cause of life-threateningrespiratory disorders at the severe stage. Notably, our study shows that transcriptional activation ofthese inflammatory cytokines is directed by major transcription factors NF-kB and STAT3 in concertwith chromatin regulators BRD2 and BRD4, and that their activities can be effectively blocked bychemical inhibitors. Motivated by our findings, in this study, we propose to identify and repurposeFDA-approved drugs to suppress SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm through simultaneouslyblocking NF-kB and STAT3 signaling pathways. We will achieve this goal by addressing the twospecific aims: (1) identify FDA-approved drugs to block uncontrolled cytokine release induced bySARS2-CoV-2; (2) validate chemical inhibition of hyperinflammation in human immune cell linesincluding human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from COVID-19 patients.

There is an urgent need to longitudinally study theimpact of the pandemic on pregnant women and the care they receive, and to understand the consequencesfor their children's birth outcomes and neurobehavioral development. Importantly, women with pre-existingsubstance use, mental health conditions and limited economic resources may be at increased risk for the wide-ranging, deleterious sequelae of the pandemic. The proposed project seeks to address these critical gaps bybuilding upon ongoing harmonized research efforts across seven geographically-representative sites from theNIH HEALthy Brains and Cognitive Development study (HBCD) initiative, including New York University,Oregon Health Sciences University, Washington University in St. Louis, University of Pittsburgh, Cedars SinaiMedical Center, University of Vermont and Northwestern University. We will enroll pregnant and postpartumwomen into a multi-wave study in which we assess medical, economic, psychosocial and substance use riskacross pregnancy and the perinatal period, studying associations of these factors to infant neurobehavioraldevelopment during the first year of life. Our central hypotheses include: 1) individual variation in perinatalCOVID-19 related stress leads to differences in birth outcomes, parenting stress and infant temperament andneurodevelopment and 2) substance use, mental health and economic risk enhance susceptibility to negativeCOVID-19 related health and psychosocial outcomes. To pursue these aims, prospective longitudinal survey,birth and postpartum data will be obtained across a 3-month period in N=100 pregnant and new mothers persite (providing a total consortium sample of N=700) to generate individual temporal profiles of COVID-19related experiences and responses, comparing outcomes with existing data from maternal-infant cohortsobtained prior to the pandemic. Further, to identify avenues for intervention, will evaluate substance use, poormental health and low social economic status as risk factors and coping, agency and utilization of resources asresilience factors that influence COVID-19 related maternal stress and child health and neurobehavioraloutcomes. The effects of geographic location will be used to examine the influence of pandemic severity,variation in local government policies and resource availability on these outcomes. Finally, we will collect andbank longitudinal perinatal biospecimens in N=40 women per site that will provide a foundation for futurestudies to evaluate the biological mechanisms through which the effects on maternal psychological andphysical health influence offspring brain and behavioral development. Through this analysis of COVID-19related stress, contextual factors and child outcomes, we will develop comprehensive understanding of effectsand modifiers of this event on health outcomes in individuals that vary in dispositional risk during perinatal life,one of the most sensitive timepoints in human development.

1152	ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY	ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY	None	2020-05-18	2021-08-31	Mechanisms of antibody-dependent enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection	The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic represents a public health emergency of global concern, due to the high levelsof morbidity and mortality, as well as the ease of transmission. Intensive research efforts are currently focusedin the development of antibody-based therapeutics that would neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and provide robustantiviral activity. In addition, several vaccine candidates are currently being tested, as an effort to provide long-lasting immunity against SARS-CoV-2. However, a major concern about the safety of these approaches stemsfrom the capacity of antibodies -either administered passively or elicited upon vaccination- to enhance viralinfection, a phenomenon that is termed as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Although ADE has beenprimarily demonstrated for flaviviruses, like dengue, it is unknown whether this phenomenon also extends tocoronaviruses. Like dengue disease, COVID-19 patients exhibit a wide range of clinical disease severity, rangingfrom asymptomatic to severe symptomatic disease, which is often fatal. This suggests that host immune factorslikely determine disease susceptibility and are critical for progression to severe disease. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent for COVID-19, shares high degree of sequence similarity with other human and batcoronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Similar to what has been shown for dengue, it is likely thatpre-existing immunity against other coronaviruses might predispose for SARS-CoV-2 infection and developmentof severe COVID-19 disease. Likewise, active or passive immunization against SARS-CoV-2 might increase thesusceptibility to infection with other coronaviruses via the presence of non-neutralizing, cross-reactive antibodies.Although there is limited evidence on the capacity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to mediate ADE, several priorstudies on SARS-CoV have provided some preliminary evidence that under specific conditions, anti-SARS-CoVantibodies might enhance infection of FcγR-expressing cells. Given the ongoing clinical development efforts forantibody-based therapeutics and vaccines to control SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is important to assess whetheranti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have the capacity to mediate ADE and if so, determine the precise molecularmechanisms and the role of FcγRs in this process. Our proposed studies aim to: (i) determine the ADE activityof IgG antibodies purified from recovered COVID-19 patients with variable degree of disease severity, (ii)generate and evaluate the ADE activity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 and anti-SARS-CoV mAbs with variable cross-reactivity and neutralization potency, and (iii) compare the ADE activity of Fc domain variants of these mAbs withselectively enhanced binding to specific human FcγRs to determine the role for human FcγRs in mediating ADEactivity. We anticipate that these studies will address a significance safety concern about the capacity ofantibodies to mediate ADE of coronaviruses, accelerating our efforts for the development of vaccine ortherapeutic interventions for the control of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

JUDE CHILDREN'S RESEARCH HOSPITAL	None	2020-06-03	2022-04-30	Household Respiratory Virus SARS-CoV-2 Transmission and Immunity Sub-Study (HRTS)	The pandemic created by the novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has generated manyunanswered questions on the best practices for prevention and treatment for those with COVID-19 disease. The mechanism behind the lack of apparent disease susceptibility in children is alsounresolved. To answer these most critical questions, we require data on how the host immunesystem responds to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease. Longitudinal cohortsestablished in naive populations are necessary for careful profiling of immune responses,disease severity, and the generation of protective memory. Disease presentation and outcomehas been highly variable among age groups and those with various underlying conditions,complicating study design. Large well-characterized human cohorts are costly to initiate anddifficult to develop quickly. In this study, we propose to use the DIVINCI Consortium cohorts,three geographically distinct human birth cohorts, which are already established andsuccessfully running to be able to immediately begin sampling individuals with suspected orconfirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly, all three cohorts have the ability to collecthousehold samples, providing insights into immunity and disease progression across a broadage range. We propose to collect respiratory samples, breast milk, stool/rectal swab, andserum/PBMC samples, and from those samples, exhaustively assay the host immune responseto SARS-CoV-2. Based on the study design, we will be able to compare naive time points tothose during active infection as well as samples from individuals who remained asymptomaticcompared to those who develop varying degrees of symptoms. Our study proposes tocomprehensively measure immune cell populations in the peripheral blood in naive (baseline)samples and convalescent samples (after infection.) We propose to develop novel reagents formeasuring SARS-CoV-2-specific T and B cells. Further, we propose to measure SARS-CoV-2viral diversity and evolution. Finally, we will be able to extensively assay serological samples todetermine measurable differences in the response between individuals with mild and severeinfection and asymptomatic and symptomatic infection, and track their subsequent susceptibilityto re-infection. The DIVINCI consortium is uniquely situated to have immediate response to theSARS-CoV-2 pandemic with the ultimate goal of a more complete understanding of the virusand the disease.

Theextent and urgency of the situation requires an aggressive approach to accelerate the delivery of solutions toaddress the immediate needs. The proposed approach augments the strong technical, clinical andcommercialization expertise of CAPCaT to get needed solutions into practice within weeks to months.The Center for Advancing Point of Care Technologies (CAPCaT) in Heart, Lung, Blood, and SleepDiseases is an offshoot of a highly successful medical product incubator, the Massachusetts Medical DeviceDevelopment Center (M2D2) at the University of Massachusetts Lowell and Medical School campuses. Thefounding goal of M2D2 was to accelerate the development of medical devices, combining the engineering andbusiness expertise of UMass Lowell (UML) with the clinical expertise of UMass Medical School (UMMS) inWorcester. Expanding upon the vision and success of M2D2, the goal of CAPCaT is to support projects todevelop and optimize novel point of care technologies (POCT) to improve the diagnosis and management ofheart, lung, blood, and sleep diseases. We have focused on these diseases because of the significantmorbidity, mortality, and cost associated with these diseases. Combined, these diseases account for 41% ofdeaths in the US and lead to over $400B in direct health care expenses plus lost income to affected patientsand caregivers. UMass has an established track record of clinical expertise and technology development in theHLBS diseases. CAPCaT funds projects that are in the later stages of POCT development, with a focus on theclinical validation of those devices. CAPCaT, along with M2D2, has a network of industry partners and fundersto support the development and commercialization of promising technologies. Among our industry partners areJohnson & Johnson, Boston Scientific, Amgen, and Hologic.CAPCaT is one of four Point of Care Technology Research Network (POCTRN) Centers (Emory/GA Tech,Northwestern, and Johns Hopkins University house the others). CAPCaT has worked with the other POCTRNCenters and its Coordinating Center (CIMIT-Mass General Hospital) and our scientific and program officers atNHLBI and NIBIB to review the situation and to understand unmet needs and resources accessible by thenetwork that can make a difference.

Outbreak forecasting and modelingsuggest that these numbers will continue to rise (2).At present, there is no specific antiviral therapy for COVID-19. Few treatment studies have been conductedbecause most human CoV strains cause self-limited disease, and care is supportive. After SARS-CoV-1 wasidentified in 2002-2003 and caused a large global outbreak, there was an increased interest in thedevelopment of specific therapeutic agents. SARS-CoV-1 patients were treated with corticosteroids, type 1 IFNagents, convalescent plasma, ribavirin, and lopinavir or ritonavir; except for ribavirin, many of these agentshave in vitro pre-clinical data that support their efficacy (3-11). Since the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak in 2002-2003,new therapeutic agents targeting viral entry proteins, proteases, polymerases, and methyltransferases havebeen tested; however, none of them has been shown to be efficacious in clinical trials (12-19).Given the lack of specific antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the known safety profiles and readyavailability of HCQ and Azithro as potential antiviral agents, based on pre-clinical and small clinical studies, thisrandomized, placebo-controlled trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of HCQ and Azithro in persons whohave active SARS-CoV-2 infection and mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms.

Here, we apply our considerable immune andtissue-immune experience towards generating and exploiting a RapidPath platform to find rapid actionableimmunotherapeutic targets for COVID-19 patients for limiting damage due to SARS-CoV-2 infections.In aim 1 of this study, we will build a lung plus virus plus immune platform in which the role of specific T cells ofdifferent activation status –alone and through their modulation of myeloids cells—will be assessed in theresponse of damage to lung epithelium plus/minus endothelium (organoid, with Roose/Gordon and lung slicewith Looney). This supplement will interact intensely with parallel studies of those labs and also with ongoingstudies that will also leverage RapidPath but are not in this first cohort of applications. This will provide `best inclass' model systems in human biology and will leverage our collective expertise. In aim 2 of this study, wewill test a panel of immunomodulatory drugs to determine if acute exposure to them can modulate lungdamage, likely through modulating myeloid biology. The net result will be validated immunotherapeuticpaths in robust pre-clinical human systems that recapitulate key features of COVID-19.	National Institutes of Health	Research Grant	312232.0 USD

This supplement entitled “Clash of Titans:Understanding the Airway Epithelial Interferon and IL-1 Response to SARS-CoV-2 Infection,” addresses acritical need during a global pandemic. Our hypothesis is that a key virulence factor in the SAR-CoV-2 virus,the E protein, triggers IL-1B secretion from epithelial cells in a gasdermin and caspase dependent manner.That IL-1 secretion acts in an autocrine fashion, to inhibit critical interferon responses that are required toconstrain the virus to the upper airway and prevent lower airway infection. The proposal allows our laboratoryto use genetically altered cell lines that we generated as part of the parent grant to quickly study the balance ofinterferon and IL-1 responses of the airway epithelium to SARS-CoV-2 infection and test commerciallyavailable drugs that block caspases or IL-1 signaling to inhibit viral replication. This proposal seeks to rapidlytranslate our current understanding of airway epithelial cell biology to address a critical need for therapeuticsagainst the SARS-CoV-2 virus which has currently infected more than a million people worldwide and killedover 60,000 in less than 4 months.

By expanding data collection to include both former NDEWS sentinel sites as well asformer Community Epidemiology Workgroup (CEWG) sites, and by incorporating novel surveillance methodsto ensure early detection of signals of new psychoactive substances and known substances, our Early WarningNetwork extends geographic representation and provides a more complete picture of the size, direction, anddepth of substance use patterns in all US Census regions. We will use novel surveillance methods to ensureearly detection of signals indicating emerging drug trends and harmonize surveillance data across sentinel andCEWG sites. We will also conduct on-the-ground epidemiologic investigations on topics of immediate crisis orneed in order to provide functional feedback to impacted communities towards optimizing current and futureresponse, and we will disseminate results rapidly to the scientific community and the public alike. Proposed Supplement: The current COVID-19 crisis underscores a need for rapid assessments of the virus’simpact in substance-using populations throughout the NDEWS Early Warning Network, as people who usedrugs appear to be at increased risk for COVID-19-related adverse outcomes and may find it more difficult toget care during the crisis. In addition, COVID-19 may alter one’s exposure to drug use, certain drugs, or mightchange patterns of drug use altogether. As an Early Warning System, NDEWS must be on the forefront of newtrends in drug use, drug-related mortality, and drug treatment utilization, all of which may be either directly orindirectly impacted by COVID-19. Although in-person human subjects research has been halted, COVID-19focused efforts that must begin now—with creative strategies that allow for immediate data to assess theimpact of COVID-19 on substance use behaviors. In this proposed study, we will (Aim 1) collect rapid responsedata on substance use-related consequences of COVID-19 from novel key informants across the country in theurban, rural, and suburban areas represented by the 18 Early Warning Network sites, focused on decedents,family members of decedents, and the community at large. Key informants will include 1) funeral directors(n=200), 2) emergency medical service personnel (n=200), and 3) syringe exchange workers (n=75). We will(Aim 2) detect trends in patterns of drug-related mortality, health services utilization, including overdosereversals, and syringe exchange services by following up with key informants at 2, 3, 4, and 5 months post-baseline. We will then (Aim 3) rapidly disseminate the data to NIDA, through media outreach, and contribute toscience through peer-reviewed publications. At a time when we cannot physically recruit or survey participantsin person due to the COVID-19 crisis, we believe this is an extraordinary opportunity to collect rich data fromkey informants nationwide. Results will provide targets for new research strategies and prevention efforts.	National Institutes of Health	Research Grant	130357.0 USD

Although MSM living with HIV who use meth can achieve viral suppression, prior research from ourteam and others has documented that recent stimulant use amplifies immune dysregulation in treated HIVinfection. MSM living with HIV are also more likely to report amplified behavioral risk such as condomless analintercourse that increases risk for HIV acquisition and onward HIV transmission. The scientific premise of thisadministrative supplement is that co-occurring meth and HIV will create a double jeopardy for the novelcoronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. In order to examine the potentially synergistic effects of meth and HIV forthe COVID-19 pandemic, we will enroll 200 MSM in a seroprevalence study testing for IgM and IgG antibodiesto the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Using an intact groups design, participants will be enrolled based onmeth use (user versus non-user) by HIV status (positive versus negative). Among men living with HIV, onlythose who report an undetectable viral load will be enrolled. Among men who are HIV-negative, only those whoare not currently taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) will be enrolled. There will be 50 participants enrolledper group: METH+HIV+, METH+HIV-, METH-HIV+, and METH-HIV-. The primary hypothesis is that thosewith co-occurring meth use and HIV (METH+HIV+) will display the greatest seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2relative to meth or HIV alone (METH+HIV- or METH-HIV+) or controls (METH-HIV-). We will also examine theextent to which co-occurring meth and HIV are indirectly linked to higher SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence viaalterations in gut-immune dysregulation, smoking behaviors, and decreased adherence to social distancingguidelines. This supplement will provide some of the first data regarding whether and how those with co-occurring meth use and HIV are more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This represents a crucial first stepto identifying high priority populations that will directly inform the development bio-behavioral interventions tomitigate risk for COVID-19. These findings will also inform targeted public health efforts to “flatten thecurve” of community-level SARS-CoV-2 transmission in this rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic.

As our world population ages dramatically over the next three decades, theburden will only increase. Hence, there is a great need to discover fundamental mechanisms of aging to developrationale strategies for minimizing the impact of aging on our health and economy. This fostered the Gerosciencehypothesis, which posits that therapeutically targeting fundamental mechanisms of aging will yield a largerdividend in terms of improving the health of an aging population than would treating individual age-relateddiseases. The fundamental mechanism of aging where this has borne out most successfully to date is throughelimination of senescent cells. Senolytic drugs were first described by us and others in 2015 and have alreadyfostered multiple clinical trials beginning in 2018. In mice, senolytics improve physical function, tissue health andsuppress all cause mortality. COVID-19 has emerged as an urgent threat to our aged population. The goal of the parent project is to fully define the mechanism by which an aged / senescent immune systemdrives morbidity and mortality using mice as a model organism. The goal of this revision is to use the knowledgeand resources we have to study the role of cellular senescence in driving adverse outcomes in aged organismsacutely exposed to novel viral pathogens. Preliminary data indicate that mice with a substantial senescent cellburden respond much worse to inflammatory challenges than mice without senescent cells. Furthermore,exposure to normal pathogens carried by wild or pet store mice is sufficient to kill old experimental mice housedin specified pathogen-free conditions, but it does not kill young mice. Here, we propose to use this experimentalparadigm to determine if senolytics, drugs that specifically kill senescent cells, suppress mortality in aged, obese,diabetic or diseased mice. The immediate goal of this revision is to generate sufficient preclinical data to supportclinical trials using nutraceuticals with senolytic activity to prevent adverse outcomes in those at high risk ofCOVID-19 infection or grave illness after infection. The long term goal of this project is to enable rigorouslytesting the Geroscience hypothesis.	National Institutes of Health	Research Grant	424619.0 USD

The disease has negatively impacted the health of millions of people around the world and istaking a toll on the global economy. The disease has been particularly difficult to contain as it is highlycontagious, has a long incubation time (2-14 days) and many carriers of the virus are asymptomatic [1-2].Initial reports of the disease showed that the symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, body aches andshortness of breath [3-4]. However, more recent reports have shown that many COVID-19 patients also losetheir ability to smell [5]. Furthermore, reports show that the patients who experience smell loss may otherwisebe asymptomatic suggesting that smell loss could potentially be an early indicator of COVID-19 in a subset ofthe population [5]. These recent findings highlight the importance of studying the relationship between smellloss and COVID-19 to better understand the mechanisms and symptoms of the disorder as well as its potentiallong term effects. The study proposed here will investigate: 1) the extent to which COVID-19 patients developsmell loss (anosmia); and 2) whether the early presence of anosmia can be used to predict the severity ofdisease. To invesitgate this urgent question, we will use the well-established 8-item “Brief” University ofPennsylvania Smell Identification Test (“B-SIT”) [6-9] to assess the olfactory abilities in patients with suspectedCOVID-19 infection who present to the COVID-19 external testing sites affiliated with the University ofPennsylvania.

We lack fundamental knowledge ofneurotypical neonatal development and struggle to disentangle the effect of opioid exposure from otherprotective and risk factors impacting infant health. The fetal stage of brain development is a critical periodwhen foundational aspects of brain structure and function are being established. In addition, postnatal braindevelopment and specialization are shaped by environmental experiences thus allowing maturation to beinfluenced by lifestyle factors associated with opioid use. This Phase I project will plan for a large scale, multi-site research study to prospectively examine human brain, cognitive, behavioral, social, and emotionaldevelopment beginning prenatally through childhood. The University of Pittsburgh is one of four linked sitesincluding Oregon Health and Sciences University, New York University and the University of Vermont that willaddress key challenges critical to the success of the planned Phase II study. Aim 1 will develop, implementand evaluate innovative recruitment and retention strategies for high-risk populations through a longitudinalsurvey of 150 pregnant women per site (n=600 across sites), half of whom are opioid using. Aim 2 willimplement a multi-site, standardized, longitudinal research protocol by enrolling 20 pregnant women per site(n=80 across sites), half of whom are opioid using. This prospective longitudinal study will collect fetal andneonatal multimodal MRI, biospecimens, and maternal psychosocial and health assessments. Aim 3 willevaluate data acquisition, processing, and statistical considerations to maximize data quality, usability, andintegration across sites. We will test the efficacy of (A) real-time motion monitoring/quality assessment forimproving overall data quality and (B) time-savings versus MRI quality using new acceleration sequenceprotocols. This approach will inform and set a strong foundation for a comprehensive and effective Phase IIresearch plan. The University of Pittsburgh site is led by a highly productive, NIH-funded investigative teamwith multidisciplinary expertise in substance use (Krans, Bogen), pregnancy (Krans), and fetal, neonatal, andpediatric neuroimaging (Luna, Panigrahy). Specifically, our team has established study protocols that yieldexcellent recruitment (~76%) and retention (~74%) rates among opioid using pregnant women, has substantialexperience with imaging the immature brain (fetal/neonatal) and is a leader in developmental cognitiveneuroscience using multimodal imaging to investigate neural mechanisms underlying neurocognitivedevelopment through adolescence. We will leverage our on-going, NIH-funded, multi-center neuroimagingstudies to provide imaging harmonization techniques and assist with the development of structural fetal brainand placental imaging pipeline for all linked sites to assistant with development of Phase II protocol.

Further,it is possible that maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and lactation confers some specificprotection through antibodies. Only one study reports the presence of IgG to SARS-CoV-2in HM. Alarming examples of antibody-dependent enhancement of other viral infections illustrate howcritical it is to understand both the profile and activity of these antibodies in HM. It is critical then tounderstand the transmission risks and protective factors between mother and child throughbreastfeeding.Design: We propose a longitudinal cohort study of COVID-19+ mothers to determine risks oftransmission (viral exposure of infants through breastfeeding by presence in HM and on areolar skin)and protective factors (SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody response in HM, profile and neutralizationcapacity) of breastfeeding. Longitudinal samples will allow us to assess temporal changes over diseasecourse.Methods: We will enroll 50 COVID+ mothers in the first 3 months of lactation, 25 symptomatic and 25asymptomatic. We will concurrently collect samples from two locations: The University of RochesterSchool of Medicine and Dentistry and New York University, NY. These sites will provide robust andstaggered access to patients. We will recruit through local hospitals and social media platforms. Motherswill provide informed eConsent. IRB approval has been received. All samples will be self-collected inthe hospital (if admitted) or in the home. There will be no physical contact between study staffand participants. Mothers will express and collect whole breastmilk on Days 0 (enrollment), 3, 10, 19,28, and 90, breast skin swabs on Days 0 and 3 and whole blood by fingerstick on days 0 and 90. Theywill also be instructed to provide a frozen HM sample from Day -7, if available.Analysis: RNA will be extracted from HM and breast skin swabs in the Jarvinen-Seppo lab. SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA will be quantitated using RT-qPCR three amplicon probe-based systemas recommended by CDC. We will compare presence and changes in SARS-CoV-2 in HM via repeatedmeasures analysis. We will assess SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus antibodies in maternal fingerprick and HM to S and N proteins of SARS1, SARS2, HKU1, 229E, NL63 and OC43 by Luminex onthe mPLEX-CoV system developed and validated by the Zand lab. Repeated measures analysis will beused to compare the changes in concentration of HM anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies over the time-courseof disease progression and also between women with mild to severe symptoms.Impact: These results are critical to understand the risks and benefits of breastfeeding in the context ofCOVID-19 infection, and are necessary to make evidence-based policies, and to care for these families.

This will inform immediate practice and policy for the recovery period. We will conduct a mixed methods study of pregnant women, postpartum mothers and fathers. The core will be a quantitative telephone/online longitudinal survey of around 1800 pregnant women at four times points during pregnancy and postpartum. They will be recruited from two large population-based studies with ongoing recruitment, supported by the Born in Bradford infrastructure in Bradford. Data during pregnancy will be collected on a range of demographic and socioeconomic factors as well as food, housing and income security, self-reported physical and mental health and wellbeing, COVID-19 related behaviours, access to maternity services, family relationships and social support, and concerns related to COVID19 as well as infant feeding plans. Parallel diary and exploratory qualitative studies will provide deeper understanding. Cortisol levels in hair samples taken in the days after birth will be compared with historical control samples. Rapid-cycle analysis of our survey and hair sample data linked with routine primary care, maternity, health visiting social care and education data will provide timely information on areas where action is needed. Longer-term follow up will be of major scientific and policy significance.

To this end, the researchers are investigating the use of health-related information by various target groups in a defined region, the Münsterland, during the "Corona crisis". Which channels are used by different population groups and how are the contents and forms of presentation evaluated? What behavior does this entail for citizens? This is done using representative surveys and expert discussions. The project complements an ongoing study (FKZ 03IHS062B) on imparting health-related knowledge in the Münsterland region, in which it is analyzed how expert knowledge in rural areas can be optimally conveyed to various target groups. The planned work should help to optimize the communication tools and channels in health communication in the medium and long term to suit target groups.

Using an allosteric HTS and in vivo platform, we identified ~300 helicase inhibitors and ~60 inhibitors targeting the ADP-ribose-binding macrodomain of ALC1/CHD1L, an oncogene. We observe high sequence/structure conservation with the SARS-CoV-2 helicase and Nsp3 X-domain macrodomain mono-ADP-ribosylhyrolase, enzymes for which we have pioneering, worldwide expertise. Since the viral helicase and one of the macrodomains of SARS-CoV-2 are essential for viral replication and to suppress the host’s immune system, they represent novel, highly promising drug targets. Our AI-supported molecular docking algorithm validated a binding pocket in the helicase, in particular. The 87 cell-permeable, drug-like and cell-active inhibitors that we have profiled are predicted to be high nanomolar SARS-CoV-2 blockers, have been profiled for toxicity, physchem properties and in silico ADMET. This will enable rapid lead optimization. The objectives of our grant are to develop a pre-clinical proof-of-concept for small molecule inhibitors toward the treatment of COVID-19 and other, future CoV infections. Our rationale for validating these novel inhibitors toward helicase and macrodomain ADP-ribosyl hydrolase enzymes of SARS-CoV-2 lies in the novelty of our targets, the orthogonal approach we have taken to identify small molecule inhibitors that target the helicase outside of its canonical ATP binding pocket and the specific coronavirus functions that our drugs disrupt."; Research Type: discovery; Study population: not applicable	Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung	Research Grant	1200000.0 EUR

Owing to its unique geographic location, the Upper Rhine region rapidly emerged as one of the earliest sites of viral transmission in Germany. As the major medical center in the area, the University Medical Center Freiburg has been a focal point of patient care, establishing robust diagnostic workflows very early in the epidemic and treating severely ill patients. This project aims to provide an in-depth characterization of the innate and adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 virus in both humans and animals. To achieve this goal, a tightly-linked consortium will leverage a unique synergy between clinicians in direct care of COVID-19 patients, a diagnostic department with established SARS-CoV-2 workflows, basic research expertise in studying highly-pathogenic zoonotic respiratory viruses in animal models, and technical resources allowing in-depth immunophenotyping. This project will provide urgently needed insights into the immune response to COVID-19 infection, including identification of immune effector cells and clarification of a potential cytokine storm. This information can directly aid clinicians in treatment decisions as well as provide key data for research into treatment and prevention strategies. The project will also establish an animal model of infection which will allow in-depth characterization of the disease as well as drug and vaccine tests.

The investigation is to be carried out in the laboratory on lung cells. In addition, the aim is to investigate whether the suspected mechanism of action that triggers ARDS can be inhibited by an active ingredient that has already been tested in clinical studies for other indications. In the short to medium term, such studies could provide important insights for the treatment of severe cases of COVID-19. If the project is successful, a starting point for the development of a therapeutic agent could be identified in the medium to long term.; Research Type: discovery; Study population: not applicable	Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung	Research Grant	50000.0 EUR
1174	Prof. Stefan Liebig	German Institute for Economic Research	None	2020-04-01	2021-03-31	The Spread of the Coronavirus in Germany: Socio-Economic Factors and Consequences	The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first identified in China in January and the respiratory disease it causes, COVID-19, have spread around the world within a matter of weeks. To prevent the medical and health system from becoming overwhelmed by patients in need of treatment, efforts are being made to slow the spread of the disease over as long a period as possible. Due to the expected increase in the number of new infections, further measures and guidelines can be expected in the coming weeks and months that will affect virtually all aspects of people’s lives in Germany. Urgent questions arise as to the medical and health impacts of the virus; the social, psychological, economic, and political factors that affect its spread; and the consequences thereof—questions that cannot currently be investigated due to the lack of a generalizable database. The planned research project aims to investigate the acute, medium-term, and long-term socio-economic factors in and consequences of the spread of the coronavirus in Germany. Based on standardized telephone surveys of a representative sample of Germany’s will focus on subjective experiences, on how informed the population is, on how people are handling the crisis at an individual level, and on identifying the individual and social factors that play a role in this crisis and the consequences thereof. The survey will cover the following topics: a) health behavior and health inequality, b) labor market and economic situations, c) social life, networks, and mobility, d) mental health and well-being, and e) social cohesion.

Understanding dynamics of public responses to such events under uncertainty is necessary to learn how to avoid either undue apathy or undue panic. This project explores how Americans? views of and behavior towards the coronavirus change?or do not change?over 9 months. This will serve the national interest in progress in science by improving our understanding of how people?s beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors interact both within the same person over time, and between people with individual differences in attitudes at a given time. The research tests a novel model of how views of personal and collective solutions to what appears to be an emerging pandemic are affected by beliefs and attitudes, which builds upon prior work including the Protection Action Decision Model. The research also may improve public health and prosperity by revealing what factors are associated with particular reactions that may make public health protection easier or harder to implement. It thus affects whether quarantines, travel bans, and other policies meant to be protective hamper or amplify economic growth as well. The project also tests messages about false beliefs and flu vaccine efficacy that may inform public health risk communication and thus improve public health.<br/><br/><br/>A longitudinal study design surveys the same Americans five times at 2-month intervals, thus over 9 months total. Each wave of the project asks the same questions: perceived risk; emotional reactions to the virus; reported personal protective behavior and support for actual or potential government policies; and beliefs about those behaviors and policies; trust in government; subjective and objective knowledge about the virus; psychological distance from the virus; how much individuals are following news about the virus; and which types of traditional and social media sources they use and which outlets they use (e.g., different TV channels or different social media sites). Repeating these questions over time allows the research team to examine whether changes occur in these views and behaviors over time, or relations between factors over time (for example, do risk perceptions actually predict later protective behaviors). Certain other factors, such as culture, conspiracy thoughts, and blatant and subtle prejudice?are measured during one survey wave as a control. The survey is complemented by content analysis of mass and social media information from sources that respondents report using, so the researchers can test effects of that exposure on objective knowledge, risk perceptions, and behaviors. An information manipulation experiment embedded in the last survey will allow testing of whether vaccination intentions for the influenza (?flu?) virus can be increased in light of perceived threat from this coronavirus, and whether false beliefs about the coronavirus threat and management can be diminished in the short-term.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1176	Hank Jenkins-Smith	University of Oklahoma Norman Campus	None	2020-04-01	2021-03-31	RAPID; Information and Implications for Protection Motivation and Action During the COVID-19 Outbreak	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - The current spread of, and alarm about, the COVID-19 virus provides a unique and ephemeral opportunity to obtain meaningful time-series survey data on public beliefs, attitudes, behaviors, and the receipt of information of various kinds about the disease and its effects on taking protective action. The National Institute for Risk and Resilience (NIRR) utilizes its on-going Twitter data collection associated with coronavirus (collected since January 2020), and undertakes a series of monthly nation-wide surveys on public views to test the broader publics? receipt of, trust in, and use of information about the virus posted on social media. The surveys will include questions about protective action behavior, trust in key actors, perceptions of risk associated with the outbreak, and perceptions of information accuracy/inaccuracy. The complementary survey and social media data streams will allow tracking the spread and penetration of information over time and as the disease spreads in order to match various narratives as they emerge on social media along with beliefs measured in the contemporaneous survey data. The time sensitive data will permit testing of hypotheses about the dynamic relationships between the spread of information in social media, broader public beliefs and behaviors, and effects on protective behaviors that may influence the spread of contagious diseases.<br/><br/>The goal of this study is to measure and track the influence of information about the COVID-19 pandemic on Twitter among members of the broader US public. The study integrates two complementary streams of data to systematically examine the impact of information bubbles and various forms of information on protection motivation and actions in response to the COVID-19 outbreak in the US. First, since January 2020 ,the research team has collected all messages on Twitter that relate to COVID-19, by establishing a connection with the Twitter streaming API. The team obtains all posts and metadata that include any of the following key words: coronavirus, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, #coronavirus, #2019_nCov, and #COVID-19. From January 27 to Feb 24, the team collected more than 31 million different messages about the virus. The Twitter posts provide a continuous flow of data about the evolution of information networks and the promulgation and spread of information, but they do not provide information on the extent to which these factors are affecting protective motivations in the broader public and shaping the perceptions that drive them (such as trust in perceived risk). Second, the team collects online rolling nationwide surveys of the broader public?s understanding of COVID-19, with special attention to beliefs about the information that appears on Twitter, over the span of the next year. There are 10 nationwide surveys in all, one each month (time-series cross-sections), with collections timed to obtain 250 responses each week to increase the ability to quickly identify changes in beliefs, perceptions and associated protective behaviors. The surveys are designed to allow pairing the changing pattern of information of various sorts on social media with the receipt and belief of that information among the broader public. The experiments draw from the rise and spread of different kinds of information on Twitter.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

None	2020-04-15	2021-03-31	Collaborative Research: RAPID: RTEM: Rapid Testing as Multi-fidelity Data Collection for Epidemic Modeling	Biological Sciences - The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic is generating significant social, economic, and health impacts and has highlighted the importance of real-time analysis of the spatio-temporal dynamics of emerging infectious diseases. COVID-19, which emerged out of the city of Wuhan in China in December 2019 is now spreading in multiple countries. It is particularly concerning that the case fatality rate appears to be higher for the novel coronavirus than for seasonal influenza, and especially so for older populations and those with prior health conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Any plan for stopping the epidemic must be based on a quantitative understanding of the proportion of the at-risk population that needs to be protected by effective control measures in order for transmission to decline sufficiently and quickly enough for the epidemic to end. Different data collection and testing modalities and strategies available to help calibrate transmission models and predict the spread/severity of a disease, have variable costs, response times, and accuracies. In this Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project, the team will examine the problem of establishing optimal practices for rapid testing for the novel coronavirus. The result will be the Rapid Testing for Epidemic Modeling (RTEM), which will translate into science-based predictions of the COVID-19 epidemic's characteristics, including the duration and overall size, and help the global efforts to combat the disease. The RTEM will fill an important gap in data-driven decision making during the COVID-19 epidemic and, thus, will enable services with significant national economic and health impact. The educational impact of the project will be on mentoring of post-doctoral and PhD researchers and on curricula by incorporating research challenges and outcomes into existing undergraduate and graduate classes. <br/><br/>Computational models for the spatio-temporal dynamics of emerging infectious diseases and data- and model-driven computer simulations for disease spreading are increasingly critical in predicting geo-temporal evolution of epidemics as well as designing, activating, and adapting practices for controlling epidemics. In this project, the researchers tackle a Rapid Testing for Epidemic Modeling (RTEM) problem: Given a partially known target disease model and a set of testing modalities (from surveys to surveillance testing at known disease hotspots), with varying costs, accuracies, and observational delays, what is the best rapid testing strategy that would help recover the underlying disease model? Several scientific questions arise: What is the value of testing? Should only sick people be tested for virus detection? What level of resources should be devoted to the development of highly accurate tests (low false positives, low false negatives)? Is it better to use only one type of test aiming at the best cost/effectiveness trade off, or a non-homogeneous testing policy? Naturally these questions need to be investigated at the interface of epidemiology, computer science, machine learning, mathematical modeling and statistics. As part of the work, the team will develop a model of transmission dynamics and control, tailored to COVID-19 in a way that accommodates diagnostic testing with varying fidelities and delays underlying a rapid testing regimen. The investigators will further integrate the resulting RTEM-SEIR model with EpiDMS and DataStorm for executing continuous coupled simulations. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded through the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program (Division of Environmental Biology) and the Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing innovation program (Engineering).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1178	Michael Pazzani	University of California-San Diego	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Explainable Machine Learning for Analysis of COVID-19 Chest CT	Computer and Information Science and Engineering - In December 2019, it was discovered that a widely contagious pneumonia was caused by a new coronavirus infection now named COVID-19. The primary test for detection of the virus is real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with sensitivity of approximately 71% in some studies. However, this test may require several days to provide a result. Perhaps more importantly, imaging with x-ray or computed tomography (CT) are required to confirm pneumonia, which is the principal cause of death, as it leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Recent studies have shown sensitivity of chest CT for approximately 98% for COVID-19 pneumonia and could provide immediate results but currently require human interpretation. Given the need for rapid, more accurate diagnosis, this project will use, adapt, and evaluate explainable machine learning techniques to diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. This project will improve the understanding of mechanisms of COVID-19 and will help mitigate its impacts.<br/><br/>Viral nucleic acid detection using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the primary method for diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, which has rapidly spread worldwide as a global pandemic. Sensitivity of this test for COVID-19 infection has been estimated at approximately 71% in some studies and may require several days for a result. X-ray and CT imaging are complementary technologies that allow diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, which can evolve to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) -- the principal cause of death in patients with COVID-19 infection. Especially early in the course of the disease, chest CT has multiple advantages over RT-PCR yielding results more quickly and is already widely deployed, but requires expert radiologist interpretation. The number of chest CTs may rapidly exceed the speed and capacity of already strained radiologists. An explainable machine learning algorithm may address this disadvantage to expedite the interpretation of chest CT and assist rapid triage of patients to the ICU, inpatient ward, monitoring unit, or home self-quarantine. Machine learning algorithms, specifically those leveraging deep convolutional neural networks (deep learning), have the potential for facilitating even more rapid diagnosis within minutes. This project seeks to validate the use of explainable deep learning methods to adjust diagnostic operating points for multiple applications, including (a) disease screening, (b) disease staging and prognostication, and (c) evaluation of treatment response.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

The majority of epidemic spread models, however, do not fully consider the tremendous uncertainty associated with human response behaviors (both populations and individual actors) and perturbations in urban system supply chains during an epidemic outbreak. For this project, the research team collects and analyzes time-bound data to better understand and predict and to more effectively respond to the risk of infection disease outbreaks in urban areas. These data can be used to help identify the underlying processes that influence urban-scale population response behaviors, collective sense-making in online social media, disruptions in urban system supply chains, and collective information processing and coordination among actors across different urban sectors. These finding can advance the fundamental understanding of the complexities of epidemic outbreak threats, which would extend beyond standard outbreak models and purely clinical research. The outcomes suggest new ways for better prediction and offer novel insights regarding ways to conduct urban-scale surveillance of epidemic spread risks. The findings inform strategies and possible data-driven tools and methods to prevent, help contain, and mitigate the effects of future epidemics and pandemics.<br/><br/>The specific project tasks are threefold. First, the project will identify and collect data that could provide weak signals about population response behaviors in response to epidemic threats. For example, anomalies in traffic patterns can suggest reduction in demand due to telecommuting. Mobility data, which informs about patterns of population fluxes, facilitates monitoring of the effectiveness of social distancing measures. Second, the project collects social media posts, such those in as Twitter, to examine how epidemic risk is processed and encoded in online social networks. Third, through organizational interviews and surveys, the project uncovers collective information processing and coordination actions among different actors across various urban sectors responding to epidemic spread risks and urban system perturbations. The data are analyzed through spatial modeling, network analysis, and data analytics techniques. In analysis of these datasets, a particular attention are given to population activity patterns in neighborhoods with vulnerable populations (e.g., elderly, low income, and racial minorities).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1180	Steven Neuberg	Arizona State University	None	2020-04-01	2021-03-31	RAPID: Implications of Coronavirus for Prejudices, Cultural Change, and Health	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - The threat of infectious disease changes how people think and act in a number of ways. Some of these changes are obvious, such as hoarding and increased anxiety. Other changes are less obvious, such as increased negative feelings toward groups associated with disease and greater aversion to novelty. Both types of changes have significant implications for societal well-being and health. Infectious disease was once the leading source of mortality for humans. As a result, humans evolved a number of behavioral and cultural responses to help avoid infection. The spread of coronavirus provides a unique opportunity to explore important theoretical questions to better understand the psychological processes relating to perceptions of disease. This project investigates how disease cues are perceived and how they influence behavior in the context of a real-world threat (COVID-19). The research tests how local disease rates and other contextual factors influence the perceptions of disease cues and how this is influenced by various forms of bias. The research also tests the extent to which the spread of the coronavirus shapes the health-related behaviors and cognition of groups who are stigmatically associated with infectious disease. Because of the associated stigma of disease, it is hypothesized that some groups will avoid seeking treatment and will mask their disease symptoms, further exacerbating a dire situation. Phenomena cued by infectious disease threat (such as prejudice, stigma, or policy preferences) can have important consequences for efforts to reduce and treat infectious disease during epidemics. Refining such models will inform public health responses regarding the current outbreak and policies pertaining to future outbreaks. The COVID-19 pandemic will have broad economic and social impacts. Governments, institutions, and corporations will benefit from further understanding and modeling as they seek to respond and adapt to this crisis and future crises.<br/><br/>This RAPID project employs a mixed-methods approach (using big data and archival time-series data analyses, large-scale longitudinal surveys, and a cross-national study) to answer key questions regarding the social dynamics of how humans respond to infectious disease threat. By studying the spread of coronavirus in concert with changes in prejudices, social attitudes, and other social variables, the research tests the hypothesis that the behavioral immune system produces specific threat perceptions, cultural ideologies, behaviors, and practices associated with disease avoidance and other adaptive responses to infectious disease threat. The research assesses the extent to which prejudiced and discriminatory reactions to a variety of targets (ethnic minorities, sexual minorities, the obese, the elderly, immigrants) are specific to disease-related targets or are generalized to all outgroups. It also assesses the experiences and health-relevant decision making of groups who are sometimes stigmatized by their association with infectious diseases, lending insight into how stigma and prejudice influence health-related behaviors. The project aims to create new theoretical bridges among a diverse range of disciplines including social psychology, evolutionary psychology, epidemiology, public health, and econometrics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1181	Natalie Shook	University of Connecticut	None	2020-04-01	2021-03-31	RAPID: Changes in Social Attitudes and Behavior in Response to COVID-19	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - For many U.S. citizens the rapidly increasing threat of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to widespread behavior change, including social distancing and self-quarantine. Determining the social and psychological factors that predict unwillingness to engage in preventative health behaviors is crucial to develop strategies for reducing widespread disease. This project identifies psychosocial factors associated with preventative behavior change, thereby highlighting who may be at greater risk of contracting and spreading COVID-19 and future infectious diseases. The research will inform interventions designed to increase preventative health behaviors that reduce pathogen transmission. The threat of COVID-19 has also altered many social attitudes, including bias toward specific groups such as people of Asian descent. This project will shed light on the long-term consequences of such social changes for policy, international relations, and individual decision making.<br/><br/>This project informs and advances basic understanding of the human Behavioral Immune System (BIS). The BIS is theorized to encompass a variety of behaviors that humans adopt to reduce disease infection, making this research particularly timely. The research tests predictions regarding how fear of contagion influences health related behaviors and social attitudes. One goal is to quantify the extent to which social behaviors and attitudes have changed in response to the COVID-19 threat. The moderating effects of individual differences (personality traits, demographics, disgust sensitivity) will also be tested. The research utilizes a novel, intensive longitudinal design that follows a large nationally representative U.S. sample for one year. Data will be collected throughout the pandemic, decreasing in frequency as the threat subsides. Online surveys will assess preventative behaviors (e.g., handwashing, social distancing), social attitudes (prejudice, dangerous worldview, social beliefs), and individual difference variables. National statistics regarding COVID-19 prevalence in each survey respondent?s locale will also be collected to determine whether changes in social attitudes and behavior parallel changes in COVID-19 threat. The project will inform current and future efforts for increasing preventative health behaviors and reducing the spread of disease.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1182	Andrew Whelton	Purdue University	None	2020-04-01	2021-03-31	RAPID: Shutdowns and Consequences ? Extreme Plumbing Stagnation and Recommissioning	Engineering - The explosive onset of school, business, and event venue shutdowns across the nation to encourage social distancing in response to COVID-19 will be disruptive on multiple levels. While 2-4 week shutdowns are increasingly being declared, some organizations have warned of longer closures. The proposing team's own school and office building water testing evidence indicates such extended shutdowns will have drastic consequences on building drinking water safety: chemical and microbiological water quality potentially presenting serious public health risks. As inhabitants return, they will encounter extremely stagnated water with excessive lead, copper, and bacterial concentrations, that may include pathogens like Legionella pneumophila. There are no national or industry guidelines for building reopening after extended shutdowns. A fundamental understanding of water quality deterioration mechanisms precipitated by large-scale shutdowns and plumbing decontamination is critically lacking. The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO) serves over 100,000 public health professionals and has made clear that building recommissioning practices are lacking. The COVID-19 building closures present a rare opportunity to study chemical-microbiological-physical- material interactions in multiple otherwise operational buildings. At both full- and bench-scales, the team will (1) characterize disinfectant, heavy metal, and bacterial changes during extended building closures, and (2) develop evidence-based plumbing remediation methods to address water quality deterioration. <br/><br/>Using a college campus affected by COVID-19, water quality will be characterized in closed or under- utilized buildings over the course of 5 months (Objective 1). All in-person class meetings have been cancelled for spring semester at Purdue, while research activities can continue, allowing real-scale study of buildings impacted by closure. Before fall semester, decontamination procedures will be tested (Objective 2). Bench-scale experiments will be conducted in parallel to simulate water use conditions and probe the fundamental factors that influenced deterioration and plumbing decontamination effectiveness. The team will elucidate the fundamental factors that control extreme chemical and microbiological transformations in plumbing that are occurring nationwide during the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as during many other disasters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1183	Tao Yan	University of Hawaii	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Determine Community Disease Burden of COVID-19 by Probing Wastewater Microbiome	Engineering - The global COVID-19 pandemic is an urgent global health and economic crisis. The impacts of the current outbreak are exacerbated by the potential for infection outbreaks to seasonally reoccur. This potential seasonal cycling presents a great challenge to the current clinic-based disease surveillance approach which does not adequately test asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients. There is a critical need for alternative methods to assess spread, as undiagnosed infections are driving disease transmission in the COVID-19 pandemic. To directly address this need, this project will develop the science to assess community infection prevalence by analyzing the wastewater microbiome, promising a rapid, sensitive, and comprehensive approach for microbial disease surveillance. Successful development will allow assessment of infection rates in the population served by the wastewater treatment plant, including those with mild or no symptoms. Such capabilities would dramatically improve surveillance of pandemics by indicating in real time where the disease is emerging in new hotspots. Such information would inform intervention strategies for controlling the current COVID-19 pandemic, and help the Nation manage future outbreaks more effectively. <br/><br/>This RAPID project has two specific research objectives in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. The first objective is to develop and optimize a highly efficient concentration and detection method for enveloped viruses (like coronavirus) in the wastewater matrix. There is urgent need for this knowledge given that the most commonly used concentration methods for viruses in water samples were developed for the non-enveloped viruses. Successful completion of this phase of the research will thus fill a major technological gap and significantly advance the capability to detect and monitor the SARS-CoV2 in water and wastewater. The second objective is to collect time-sensitive wastewater samples from communities impacted by the disease. The wastewater will be used to determine the abundance, diversity, and temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV2 and other enveloped viruses in the wastewater. These data will be analyzed to reconstruct the extent of COVID-19 community transmission. The research will generate much-needed information on community transmission of COVID-19, as well as serve to validate the wastewater-based surveillance approach. If successful, this research will provide a new avenue to protect the public health of the Nation through wastewater surveillance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

One major challenge associated with combating this disease is the lack of a rapid diagnostic device. Although current tests are sensitive, they require specially equipped laboratories and can take several days to provide results. This project aims to identify and validate antibodies for use in real-time, point-of-care, COVID-19 biosensor devices. Such devices could allow doctors and other healthcare professionals to immediately diagnose infected individuals and get them the treatment they need while more effectively containing the spread of this pandemic.<br/><br/>SARS-CoV-2 is the viral cause of the COVID-19 illness. An antibody-based nanoplasmonic barcode biosensor could a provide real-time, point-of-care diagnostic device. This project will develop such a sensor. The first objective is the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 binding antibodies. To ensure a sufficient diversity of antibodies are identified, three parallel discovery pathways will be pursued: 1) the identification of antibodies that cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV spike proteins, 2) the rational engineering of anti- SARS-CoV-1 antibodies to bind SARS-CoV-2, and 3) the in silico, de novo design of novel SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. About four antibody pairs will be selected from the antibodies discovered through the three complementary approaches. The pairs will be used for SARS-CoV-2 detection on the basis of their affinity measured by ELISA and surface plasmon resonance and of the selectivity of their binding to unique epitopes, as monitored by competition ELISA. Finally, the antibody pairs will be used in the design and evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 nanoplasmonic biosensors. Nanoparticle signals will only be detected by the biosensors in the presence of virus. The proposed research will enable the more rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 compared to current diagnostic tests, resulting in a better understanding of its spread and more effective containment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1185	Ranjan Srivastava	University of Connecticut	None	2020-04-01	2021-03-31	RAPID: Multiscale Modeling Of SARS-CoV-2 Viral Intracellular and Intercellular Dynamics	Biological Sciences - ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>The recent emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the etiological agent of COVID-19, has caused worldwide repercussions in just a few short weeks. The tremendous negative social, economic and health impact will be felt for a considerable time around the globe. Numerous complementary strategies must be taken to address this issue and to ameliorate the consequences. One such strategy that is clearly required is a better understanding of the fundamental biology of SARS-CoV-2. The objective of this project is to create a multiscale model of the intracellular and intercellular viral dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. A systems virology approach is used. This project would deliver an understanding of how the virus works and will provide the framework necessary for numerous fundamental studies and applied efforts for developing effective drugs and therapies. The developed model would be released under an open source license and made freely available from the GitHub website. The project would train one graduate student in the area of computational systems virology. <br/><br/>This project creates intracellular and intercellular models of the SARS-2019-CoV-2 virus based on the current understanding of the virus reaction network. The reaction network topology is translated into a mathematical model with the use of the theory of reaction kinetics. A set of ordinary differential equations describing the dynamics of viral replication within an infected cell is formulated with the use of the mass action kinetics paradigm. With the use of Monte Carlo sampling of the model?s parameter space, as well as sensitivity analysis and stability analysis, mathematical and biological constraints are identified. Stochastic simulation is carried out to determine whether subpopulations of infected cells exist with potentially different phenotypes. Finally, with the use of principles grounded in basic calculus, the intracellular model is coupled to a standard intercellular model of viral replication dynamics. The multiscale models undergo the same analyses as the intracellular model and is also implemented stochastically to determine if incorporating higher scale information influences prediction of subpopulation distribution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1186	Debra Laefer	New York University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: DETER: Developing Epidemiology mechanisms in Three-dimensions to Enhance Response	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - The DETER project will collect data sets that can transform the study of virus transmission from two-dimensional mapping exercises into highly detailed, three-dimensional propagation models to better equip communities with the information they need for improved disease tracking, community-transmission prediction, and preventative disinfection strategies. The project will provide new types of data related to human behavior when leaving healthcare facilities that will allow more localized disease transmission models to be created. The project will track human behavior in terms of where people go (e.g. bus, coffee shop) and how they physically interact with the environment (i.e. what they touch and for how long). The project will immediately make publicly available data that could be critical for modeling virus-based outbreaks including predicting further community transmission during the current COVID-19 pandemic.<br/><br/>Community-transmission is responsible for over three-quarters of the COVID-19 cases in the US. Yet, current models do not consider localized behavior to predict virus transmission or the extent of propagation within individualized settings and their surrounding communities. The DETER project will provide such data and demonstrate new three-dimensional means to understand community-level risk. The DETER project investigates how generalizable human behavior is in terms of destination selection after visiting a healthcare facility and the extent and types of hand-based interaction with the built environment. These questions will be answered through tracking individuals when leaving healthcare facilities and recording touch-based behaviors on public transportation and public accommodations. The project will provide a transferable framework and a data integration strategy that can be adopted into a wide variety of three-dimensional models and schema that will help equip researchers and local communities with better methods for predicting community-based transmission.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1187	Sunny Jiang	University of California-Irvine	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID:Comparative quantitative microbial risk assessment of COVID-19 transmission through droplets, aerosols and contaminated surfaces	Engineering - The global COVID-19 pandemic caused by the virus SARS-CoV2 has caused considerable human health and economic impacts because of its rapid spread and high fatality rate. Examining the trend of COVID-19 data suggests other routes of transmission beyond direct person-to-person transmission are likely. Recent reports show that aerosols containing SARS-CoV2 could still infect an individual for up to 3 hours later, and plastic surfaces contaminated with SARS-CoV2 can remain infective for up to 3 days. Trace evidence of the virus was recovered from Diamond Princess cruise ship cabins up to 17 days after the passengers left. The goal of this project is to understand COVID-19 transmission through virus-contaminated respiratory droplets, fine solid or liquid particles in air, and contact with virus-contaminated surfaces. This study will model human behaviors effecting disease transmission, the properties of the virus, and environmental factors that may affect disease transmission to predict infection risk. If successful, this project will help describe transmission patterns of SARS-CoV2 and provide new ways to slow or halt the spread of this disease in the US. <br/> <br/>The goal of this project is to identify the infection risk of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 through different exposure routes in order to prioritize measures for public health protection. The specific objectives of this work are to: 1) model the spread of SARS-CoV2 through droplets and aerosols from coughing/sneezing and through aerosols generated from toilet flushing under different environmental conditions; 2) develop exposure models through inhalation of droplets and aerosols to determine the dose of single and repeated exposure; and 3) model repeated exposure through contact with contaminated surfaces and hands-to-face transmission. The models will incorporate mechanistic understanding of aerosol generation, transport, and fate under different conditions, as well as data fitting to predict aerosol size and concentration under different test scenarios. SARS-CoV2 viral shedding rate from patients and its persistence in different environmental media will be used to model the viral load through aerosol and contact exposure. Human physiology and habits will be coupled with viral attack rates to quantify the risk using a Monte Carlo probability simulator. The sensitivity analysis will also identify data gaps for rapid data collection in collaboration with teams of researchers from different disciplines. The results of this project will contribute to the understanding of global spread of infectious disease beyond short and long-term remediation strategies on COVID-19.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1188	Dominique Duncan	University of Southern California	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: COVID-ARC (COVID-19 Data Archive)	Computer and Information Science and Engineering - The goal of this 12-month project is to develop a data archive for multimodal (i.e., demographic information, clinical-outcome reports, imaging scans) and longitudinal data related to COVID-19 and to provide various statistical and analytic tools for researchers. There is an immediate need to study SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, and this archive provides access to data along with user-friendly tools for researchers to perform analyses to better understand COVID-19 and encourage collaboration on this research. The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly across the world, and governments are imposing travel bans, quarantine laws, business and school closings, and many other restrictions in efforts to contain the virus and limit the spread. However, much is still unknown about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. There is an urgent need for scientists around the world to work together to model the virus, study how the virus has changed and will change over time, understand how it spreads, and discover a vaccine. The work from this project can also prepare scientists for future pandemics by putting the infrastructure in place to enable researchers to aggregate data and perform analyses quickly in the event of an emergency. Existing resources track how many cases are tallied per region, but lack imaging and other modalities that, when combined, will facilitate the ability for researchers to truly understand COVID-19 beyond the spread of the virus, in search of potential vaccines.<br/><br/>The approach is to develop a platform of networked and centralized web-accessible data archives to store multimodal data related to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 and make them broadly available and accessible to the world-wide scientific community to expedite research in this area due to the urgent nature of the COVID-19 pandemic. The data will include clinical-evaluation (symptoms), vitals (spirometry, temperature, respiration rate, heart rate, etc.), demographic, geolocation, electrocardiography (EKG), computed tomography (CT), X-rays, position emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data as well as other data that may be collecting in the coming months. By leveraging previous work in developing data repositories and archival capabilities at the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging at the University of Southern California, COVID-ARC (COVID-19 Data Archive) aims to provide an efficient and secure data-repository platform that facilitates data access and analysis. COVID-ARC provides tools for researchers to visualize and analyze various types of data as well as a website with tools for training, announcements, virtual information sessions, and a knowledgebase wherein researchers post questions and receive answers from the community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1189	Alicia Torres	Child Trends Inc	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Broadening Access to Science-Based Information and Practices to Protect Families and Curb the Spread of COVID-19 Among Low Income Families?With a Focus on Latino Families	Education and Human Resources - This RAPID was submitted in response to the NSF Dear Colleague letter related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This award is made by the AISL program in the Division of Research on Learning, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. COVID-19 presents a national threat to the health of children and families, presenting serious implications for the mental and physical health of children. Child development scientists have already warned of increasing stress levels among the U.S. child population, especially those in low-income families of color. In addition, Latino children are disproportionately impoverished, and benefit from culturally relevant information. Parents and caregivers need to be armed with effective science-based strategies to improve child prospects during this global crisis. Harnessing well-established partnerships?including with local TV news partners and parent-serving organizations?strengthens the potential for broad impacts on the health and well-being of children and families during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the pandemic persists, widely disseminating accurate research-based strategies to support parents and families, with a focus on low-income Latino parents, is crucial to meeting the needs of the nation?s most vulnerable during this global crisis. The award addresses this urgent need by producing research-based news videos on child development for distribution on broadcast television stations that reach low income Latino parents. The videos will communicate research-based recommendations regarding COVID-19 in ways that are relatable to Latino parents and lead to positive parenting during this pandemic. A "how to" video will also be produced showing parents how to implement some of the practices. Project partners include Abriendo Puertas, the largest U.S. parenting program serving low-income Latinos, and Ivanhoe Broadcasting. <br/><br/>Research questions include: 1) What information do parents need (and potentially what misinformation they are being exposed to)? 2) What are they sharing? 3) How does this vary geographically? 4) Can researchers detect differences in public engagement in geographic areas where TV stations air news videos as compared to areas that don?t? This project will use data and communication science research strategies (e.g. natural language processing from online sites where parents are asking questions and sharing information) to inform the content of the videos and lead to the adoption of featured behaviors. Data from web searches, public Facebook pages, and Twitter posts will be used to gain a window into parents? main questions and concerns including information regarding hygiene, how to talk about the pandemic without frightening their children, or determining veracity of what they hear and see related to the pandemic.<br/><br/> This organic approach can detect concerns that parents may be unlikely to ask doctors or discuss in focus groups. Methodologically, the researchers will accomplish this by natural language analysis of the topics that parents raise; the words and phrases they use to talk about specific content; and any references to external sources of information. Where possible, the researchers will segment this analysis by geography to see if there are geographical differences in information needs and discourse. A research brief will share new knowledge gained with the field on how to respond to national emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, using local TV news and reinforcement of messages across contexts. The findings from this award will provide a knowledge base that can be utilized to better inform responses to national emergencies in the future. By broadly disseminating these findings through a research brief, the project?s innovative research will advance the field of communication science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1190	Grace Panther	University of Nebraska-Lincoln	None	2020-04-15	2021-03-31	RAPID: Faculty Adaptability and Community Engagement when Teaching in a Crisis	Engineering - The alarming spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has spurred a national emergency. Many universities announced in mid-March 2020 that all courses taught in classrooms will be delivered online for the remainder of the semester. This requirement means that faculty have no choice but to change their teaching practices immediately. The requirement to rapidly change teaching practices across the country has rarely occurred. In this instance, it may mark a critical time of change in how university courses are taught and how university faculty view teaching. University teaching practices, particularly in technical fields, have been notoriously slow to adapt to changes in technology and a growing understanding of best-practices under a variety of educational circumstances. For instance, lecture is no longer recognized by education researchers as the most helpful for all types of learning. The unfolding response to the COVID-19 mandate to teach remotely (online) provides a unique, one-time opportunity for ground-breaking research to study how crisis-induced changes to instruction influence faculty?s teaching experience. RAPID response funding will enable real-time documentation of the faculty experience during this crisis and help explain the results of studies of teacher-design instruction generated during the COVID-19 event. The results of this study will help future efforts to build faculty?s sense of community around teaching. Building a greater sense of community around teaching will benefit society by improving teaching practices which in turn will improve student persistence, learning, and engagement. Such improvements can ultimately lead to engineering graduates who are better prepared to tackle the diverse challenges that society faces now and into the future. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to identify cognitive and emotional themes concerning faculty and staff adaptability and community engagement during a crisis compared to those found under typical teaching circumstances. To accomplish this goal, the objective of this work is to track changes in the teaching experiences of faculty and staff during a crisis by collecting and analyzing data acquired through surveys and interviews. Two research questions will guide the project: 1) During a crisis, how do engineering faculty and staff experience a sudden change in course delivery (with a focus on cognition, emotions, and community engagement)? 2) How do these experiences vary throughout the duration of the crisis? A hybrid convergent and sequential mixed-methods approach will be used to track the teaching experiences of faculty as the crisis progresses. Data collection will be guided by the adaptability framework dimensions of cognition and emotions with additional data being collected around community engagement. Data collection will consist of brief weekly surveys (n=75) and three semi-structured phenomenographic interviews with engineering faculty (n=10) and the staff who support them (n=5) spread over the remainder of the semester. This work will contribute fundamental knowledge on faculty?s adaptability and community engagement in the face of an urgent need to deliver courses differently and could help shape the design of professional development opportunities that promote adoption of research-based pedagogies and instructional technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

In response to a threat such as COVID-19, their mission requires the communication of accurate and credible information to local populations using a variety of media channels. Increasingly, social media is a critical component of their communication toolbox - but using it to rapidly and effectively inform the public in a crowded media environment remains a significant challenge. In prior work on online communication associated with the Zika and Ebola outbreaks, the PIs established that effective messaging depended upon employing a combination of content, style, and structure features - but that the right mix seemed to depend upon properties of the disease event (including the uncertainty and ambiguity of the threat, the nature of the consequences involved, and the need for public information). COVID-19 poses a distinct risk profile, with a disruption potential to the American public and the built environment not seen by any threat within decades. This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project will identify the key drivers of effective messaging in an emerging pandemic, and strategies for improving effectiveness in social media communication involving COVID-19 by public agencies. The specific focus will be on the outcomes of message retransmission (essential for both high levels of message penetration and ensuring multiple exposures critical for behavioral influence) and engagement (a critical indicator of attention and a driver of trust), both of which are measurable and established as core outcomes in prior studies of effective social media communication. By establishing evidence-based guidance for agencies to effectively warn, inform, and engage the general public during an emerging pandemic, this project will provide critical guidance needed to mount effective interventions that save lives, reduce economic losses, and protect the security of the nation against health threats, in alignment with the broader mission of the NSF.<br/><br/>This objective will be pursued through the following core activities: (1) collection of perishable social media data on COVID-19 messaging by public agencies, and public engagement with/retransmission of those messages; (2) content coding of COVID-19 messages, to typologize information that is specific to the present event; (3) characterization of messaging strategies used by public agencies in the evolving COVID-19 response; (4) predictive analysis of message outcomes based on message context, content, style, and structure; and (5) development of evidence-based guidance for effective social media messaging by public agencies in response to this and similar events. This research strategy builds on successful prior work in response to emergent infectious disease threats and in the context of anthropogenic and natural hazard events. The intellectual merit of the research includes: Risk communication messages on social media are real time traces of online in/formal communication shared under conditions of imminent and ongoing threat; Research on communication and messaging dynamics online provides insights into the social amplification of risk, via diffusion of information; and strategies to design effective messages. This project will test the risk communication on social media model in response to a global pandemic by analyzing official communication from state, local, and national public health and emergency management Twitter accounts. The findings from this work will lead to the further development and refinement of the social amplification of risk framework and the risk communication on social media model. The broader impacts of this work most prominently include the accumulation of an evidence base for social media messaging, as noted above. This research will have immediate benefits to organizations and agencies tasked with communicating to at risk populations about emergent infectious disease in the context of the built environment. Our findings will inform the design and dissemination of risk communication messages and will be immediately applicable to public health and safety organizations in the context of COVID-19. Results will be shared via fact sheets, webinars, published papers, and presentations with academic and practitioner audiences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Remdesivir has been identified as one of the most promising treatments for COVID-19; recently receiving fast-track approval for Phase III trials and compassionate use against this rapidly spreading and deadly disease. However, today Remdesivir is not an approved drug and is therefore not manufactured at scale. This project offers potential for accelerated production of Remdesivir by removing manufacturing bottlenecks of intermediates that threaten rapid scale-up and efficient manufacturing. Upon approval, process bottlenecks could inhibit mass-production, delay global availability and jeopardize millions of lives. An optimized production method for key intermediates is urgently needed to meet worldwide demand that will be critical in the race to control the pandemic. Potential problems with the current processes include costly and hazardous raw materials, low yields, expensive and specialized equipment required for harsh operating conditions and air- and water-free environments, and arduous purification and facility clean-up procedures. In addition, this project also provides a simplified, modular and faster approach for building libraries of derivative molecules to screen against COVID-19 and future viral threats.<br/><br/>This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop an optimized manufacturing process for Remdesivir, one of the most promising COVID-19 therapeutic candidates identified to date, using photocatalysis, a powerful new chemical technology driven by light. Research objectives include using photocatalysis to develop a vastly superior synthesis route requiring fewer process steps, less toxic reagents and milder and safer reaction conditions. The new route will eliminate the need for specialized production equipment and procedures to maintain cryogenic temperatures and air- and water-free environments, will result in faster production times and overall higher yields, and will alleviate arduous purification and facility clean-up. The improved process will also facilitate installation of new molecular architectures and development of derivative molecules vital for efficacy screening against this and future viral threats. A second objective is to optimize the process for manufacturing at scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1193	Wesley Shrum	Louisiana State University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: A Comparative Study of How Context Shapes Responses to COVID-19	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - The primary objective of this collaborative RAPID research project is to further our understanding of how cultural and political contexts shape the ways people perceive and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The research team will conduct 400 interviews across multiple urban and rural areas for an analysis oriented towards understanding how individuals construct and modify their perceptions given information from a wide variety of sources and their network of interactions with friends and family. The results of this project will provide a deeper understanding of the social mechanisms that shape perceptions and behaviors to public policy responses in culturally and politically diverse contexts. Perceptions of disease (i.e., perceived seriousness, susceptibility, and threat) shape perceived barriers and benefits to action, which in turn affect behavior. While it is given that these perceptions are important to understand health-related behaviors as well as support for various treatments and actions, it is crucial to understand how these perceptions are generated. The project interviews and the analysis are to be widely distributed to provide grounded guidance for policy makers and others seeking to understand the diversity of fears, risk perceptions, preparedness, and acceptable actions in pandemics.<br/><br/>The research team will collect qualitative and quantitative data on groups selected for their importance to pandemic processes (transmission and treatment of information and infectious agents). The groups are stratified into five categories: scientists, medical professionals, teachers, the informal sector, and the unemployed. The purposes of the Interviews are to Identify the principal sources of information about COVID-19 transmission, treatment, and risk, including both new and old media as well as the factors associated with their relative importance across regions, occupations, and rural/urban areas; to examine factors that impact the credibility of sources in both absolute and relative terms; and to assess the level of knowledge and preparation for COVID-19 transmission, treatment, and risk. They will be used to Identify primary fears and concerns relevant to the current spectrum of treatment, isolation, and containment technologies. The results of this project will contribute to an understanding of the different ways cultural and political contexts shape response to outbreak information and directives, and they will provide guidance for policy makers seeking to understand these differences.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Science and Technology Studied Program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1194	Franco Montalto	Drexel University	None	2020-04-15	2021-03-31	RAPID: Park Usage During Mandated Social Distancing	Engineering - Comprising a complex network of interconnected subsystems, cities are particularly vulnerable to pandemics like COVID-19 due to high population densities and the fact that a single event can trigger cascading effects across functionally interdependent physical, social, and economic domains. By observing the behavior of park users, this study focuses attention on the complex and potentially opposing roles that parks and other natural and engineered forms of green infrastructure (GI) play in residential neighborhoods of Philadelphia and New York City during the pandemic. The role of parks is complex because while on one hand, visits to these sites can build social resilience by promoting social contact, recreation, leisure, and other psychosocial processes that build trust, generate place attachment, social support, and feelings of belonging and empowerment, on the other hand visits to parks could potentially accelerate spread of this highly contagious disease by creating more person to person contact and/or transmission of the virus to playground surfaces, benches, handrails, bike racks or other surfaces. The overarching hypothesis is that as the pandemic progresses, fewer and fewer people will engage in risky park behavior, but parks will eventually become havens for homeless who seek social distance as infection rates rise in shelters and the weather improves through the spring and summer. <br/><br/>Because of the national shortage of COVID-19 testing, swabbing, sampling, and laboratory testing of parks surfaces is deemed impossible. The focus of this study is instead on the observed behavior of park users, and documentation of usage patterns that potentially pose an elevated risk of infection. This goal is approached through implementation of a novel approach through paid citizen scientists, enabled by digital technology, and designed to promote economic resilience in the very neighborhoods to be studied. The work will be conducted over the course of one full year and contains 12 discreet but interconnected tasks performed in 20-40 strategically selected parks in residential neighborhoods of Philadelphia and New York City. An Advisory Panel will be formed to help guide the work and interpret results. The research will advance knowledge in the fields of urban green infrastructure, citizen science, urban resilience, and social-ecological systems in the context of an unprecedented international pandemic. The PI has extensive interdisciplinary research experience in these fields and has worked collaboratively with governmental and nongovernmental stakeholders in the two cities before. The research will generate novel data sets regarding public use of parks as COVID-19 spreads and will search for correlations between these observations and park and neighborhood characteristics. It will also evaluate the feasibility with which unemployed urban residents can rapidly become crucial human "sensors" who collect important fine spatial resolution observations within these two large cities. The study will generate results of relevance to urban parks and natural resource managers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1195	Michael Nelson	Pennsylvania State Univ University Park	None	2020-04-15	2021-03-31	RAPID: Collaborative Research: COVID-19, Crises, and Support for the Rule of Law	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - The rule of law is at the foundation of modern liberal democracy. Crises like the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, however, pose a challenge to this long-standing norm that buttresses modern democracies the world over. In the midst of a crisis, a person?s support for the rule of law is tested as their fundamental concern for the health, safety, and welfare of themselves, their families, and their friends is pitted against an abstract belief that the government ?check all the boxes? before carrying out potentially lifesaving policies. In these situations, one?s desire for decisive government action may overwhelm, and subsequently lead to a decline in, one?s commitment to abstract democratic principles like the rule of law. Consequently, evaluating how crises affect support for fundamental democratic norms is critical for understanding their impact on the health and stability of the liberal democratic order.<br/><br/>This project leverages the COVID-19 outbreak to examine this relationship and determine (a) whether governmental responses to crises affect citizens? support for the rule of law; (b) whether citizens? faith in government efforts is buttressed or undermined in response to elite and expert cues; and (c) whether citizens? attitudes change after a crisis has dissipated. Each of these theoretical aims is tied to one of three unique features of the research design, which relies upon surveys of European democracies. First, to examine the effects of governmental responses, the project will make collect survey data on support for the rule of law across four Western democracies in April 2020: Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Second, an original panel survey in Germany will enable the evaluation of changes to individual-level rule of law judgments in the short, medium, and long term. Lastly, embedded survey experiments will provide causal evidence on how elite and expert cues affect both the acceptance of policies and support for key aspects of the rule of law like compliance with laws and support for judicial constraints on executive and legislative power. Findings from each part of the project will provide insights into the individual-level dynamics crises activate in citizens? relationship with democratic principles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Because the coronavirus is highly contagious and results in severe disease in a relatively high percentage of those infected, healthcare resources, particularly hospital beds and essential personnel, are expected to be at or beyond capacity at the height of the epidemic. This project develops quantitative methods to estimate how interventions such as screening and surveillance via telemedicine and offsite testing and diagnosis can reduce the load on hospital personnel. The models developed are expected to improve the ability of hospital decision makers to predict equipment needs to ensure critical hospital personnel are protected and able to provide effective in-patient treatment.<br/><br/>This EAGER award supports fundamental research in methods to integrate a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-infected (SEIRI) virus transmission model with a risk-averse sequential operational planning model for patient beds, staffing and personal protective equipment (PPE) in hospitals. The operational planning model comprises a stochastic optimization model that includes deployment of telemedicine for initial screening and surveillance, drive-through testing for diagnosis, and in-patient hospital care for those with severe disease. The project represents a tight collaboration between the PIs and Mayo Clinic Jacksonville (MCJ). The model parameters will be updated dynamically using MCJ data as part of a pilot project, and once tested, the decision-support system will be made available online for other hospitals in the nation and the world to use.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project will take advantage of the large-scale availability of location-sensing devices and apps that produce big data on mobility patterns that can be used to better optimize the use of healthcare facilities. This research brings together rapidly unfolding health data with real-time data on mobility. We will examine how these two critical data resources can be linked to better inform policy, identify emerging hotspots, and target critical actions during a pandemic. This research will help public officials to better understand and adapt to changing conditions as a health emergency arises and expands.<br/><br/>The spread of the ?flattening curves? graphic was significant in promoting public understanding of the criticality of social distancing. These curves, however, were based on simulated data. This research will collect and examine mobility data and public health data to model flattening curves using real data. We combine big data from location-based apps and cellphones with Electronic Medical records from UMMS hospitals, including data on COVID-19 tests, and patient demographics and prognostics. New modeling approaches that quantitatively measure change in collective movement behaviors in response to the fast-evolving COVID-19 outbreak will be linked to hospital usage and capacity. The methods of this research will extend our knowledge of highly integrated systems, like transportation and health, and better prepare the public for future disasters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1198	Tyler Radniecki	Oregon State University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Tracking the Coronovirus in municipal wastewater	Engineering - The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused major human health and economic impacts. One of the most critical questions is determining who is infected to help understand how rapidly the outbreak has progressed. With the continuing mismatch between testing need and capacity, alternative methods are needed to assess the outbreak. Further difficulty in monitoring the outbreak results from the fact that most infected individuals do not show COVID-19 symptoms immediately. These issues limit the ability of decision makers to determine where outbreaks are occurring within their communities, when outbreaks start, and when outbreaks slow or stop. The goal of this project is to address such limitations by developing the science behind monitoring the spread of the disease through community wastewater surveillance. To achieve this goal, the research will measure SARS-CoV2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in the wastewater system. This new detection method will allow for decision makers to assess potential outbreaks before symptomatic people request testing. In addition, results will help determine which communities have infected individuals. This is particularly important to assess whether the COVID-19 outbreak is slowing in response to interventions.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to determine the onset, duration, termination, and location of the COVID-19 outbreak via wastewater surveillance. This work will test two hypotheses that: 1) SARS-CoV2 virus RNA concentrations in sewage and stormwater correlates with the initiation, progression, and decline of a community?s aggregate COVID-19 infection; 2) Spatial sampling within a sewer system network can isolate the location of COVID-19 hotspots within a given community. To test these hypotheses, two objectives will be completed: 1) SARS-CoV2 RNA in four Clean Water Services (CWS, Washington County, Oregon) wastewater treatment facilities and stormwater collection systems will be quantified using reverse transcriptase droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (RT-ddPCR) on a weekly basis. In the wastewater treatment plants, SARS-CoV2 RNA will be quantified in liquid primary clarifier effluent and in primary clarifier solids. At stormwater collection systems, SARS-CoV2 RNA will be quantified from the liquid and solid fractions. 2) SARS-CoV2 RNA will be quantified using RT-ddPCR at 12 selected sampling points throughout the CWS sewer system network on a biweekly basis through June, 2020, and monthly for the remainder of the project. The results will be incorporated into a GIS system containing publicly available demographic databases to identify COVID-19 hotspots and possible underlying contributing factors. The results of this work will demonstrate the feasibility of using wastewater collected at a centralized treatment facility to monitor COVID-19 outbreaks for an entire community. A second outcome of this work will determine how SARS-CoV2 RNA partitions between wastewater solids and liquid factions. Additionally, this work will determine if stormwater is a potential reservoir of SARS-CoV2 RNA during a COVID-19 outbreak. Finally, this work will demonstrate how sampling throughout a sewer line network can identify COVID-19 outbreak hotspots. If successful, this research could lead to other similar monitoring efforts for other viral outbreaks and protect the public health of the Nation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

With the need for social distancing, the ability to continue essential business functions through effective remote work arrangements is a key means for addressing the global health crisis. However, many organizations are unprepared to accommodate a remote workforce and likewise lack insight into best practices as to how to promote continued productivity and well-being of the workforce in such arrangements. Although there is a large body of extant research on remote work arrangements, numerous questions remained under investigated. This project will address these gaps by studying the impact of several organizational, individual, technological, and supervisor characteristics on remote worker adjustment, well-being, and productivity. Findings from the project will provide evidence-based best practices that many large and small businesses can use both during future pandemics and other extreme events, but also going forward in normal work environments that may increasingly want to support remote work.<br/><br/>The COVID-19 pandemic has suddenly promoted the need for remote work arrangements on a vast scale, but we lack key information regarding what makes such work productive and sustainable. This project will obtain data from 500 full-time employees who are working remotely during the response to COVID-19 but were not doing so previously. The first phase of the project will collect a baseline survey that captures characteristics and experiences prior to the pandemic and remote work transition and general perceptions of the adjustment to remote work process. Phase 2 involves a 30-day experience sampling study administered daily at the end of each workday that will capture day-to-day experiences, attitudes, and performance of remote workers. Benefits of this panel design are: 1) provides insights into how multiple dynamic changes influence outcomes; 2) enhances ecological validity; 3) allows researchers to examine both within- and between-person processes; and 4) reduces retrospective recall biases. The project will partner with several work organizations to collect the data. Data from Phase 1 will be analyzed using regression and dominance analysis; data from Phase 2 will be analyzed using multi-level modeling which controls for nested structures, adjusting standard errors to take into account the lack of independence. These analyses also control for between-subject variables and previous measurements while also accounting for missing data.

There is an urgent need to enhance the ability to precisely track and predict spread of the disease. However, analysis of classical epidemiological data such as the time of testing and lengths of exposure provides limited insight. This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project aims to enable discovery of disease transmission patterns based on analysis of genomic data, provide accurate identification of transmission clusters, and enable detection of critical nodes in a network of pathogen hosts while also providing insight into pathogen-mutation processes that occur during the spread of the disease.<br/><br/>The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Develop methods for the inference of a network of hosts based on genomic information about viral pathogens infecting them. In particular, this research thrust is focused on the reconstruction of a weighted directed graph whose nodes represent hosts and edge weights reflect evolutionary distance between corresponding pathogens. (2) Develop methods for the discovery of transmission clusters and identification of critical nodes in the host network. The focus of this research thrust is on deep-learning algorithms for the identification of transmission clusters, and discovery of the host network nodes that played a pivotal role in the disease outbreak. (3) Relying on the developed methods, analyze publicly available COVID-19 datasets. The results of the outlined work are expected to have an immediate impact on the understanding of the coronavirus transmission and spread.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

The lack of widespread availability of testing, combined with a high rate of false negative tests, contribute to quarantine failure and confusion among health authorities and the public. The investigator proposes to combine biosensing and biophotonics approaches to develop and demonstrate a rapid, room temperature, single-step, virus-specific, and ultrasensitive digital resolution assay for COVID-19 that can be performed immediately after sample collection at the point of care, and provide a result in less than 15 minutes. <br/><br/>The investigator and his group recently demonstrated that a photonic crystal surface can amplify the scattering of light from surface-attached nanoparticles, including virions, and that a new form of biosensor microscopy called Photonic Resonator Interference Scattering Microscopy (PRISM) can detect and digitally count the virus particles in real time, without the use of additional labels or stains.

The research team will focus specifically on the effects of Covid-19 as a stressor to healthcare end-users of PPE (i.e., hospitals and medical clinics). The team will focus on the uncertainty of supply and demand and seeks to identify the best policies to reduce the impact for these end-users while ensuring quality of care and protection of medical staff. The primary aim of this study is to collect data and use optimization and analytical methods to assist medical providers during the Covid-19 crisis while also considering the longer-term potential of mitigating environmental impact and increasing resilience in healthcare supply chains. <br/><br/>The approach of the study is two-fold: (1) data collection on PPE usage and supply chains, and (2) development of novel robust optimization models. A contribution of this study is to be collection of data on the physical PPE supply chain, hospitals' historic and current (emergency) use of PPE, and emerging PPE conservation policies and practices enacted by hospitals during the Covid-19 pandemic. To gather additional data, the research team has developed a novel crowd sourcing data collection platform that can later be adapted for other healthcare data collection as well. An additional feature parallel of this work lies in the development of mathematical scenario-based and robust optimization models for PPE supply chain and resource allocation. The research team will develop linear and robust optimization models to allocate the scarce resources given large uncertainty in demand and supply. These resource-allocation models will use the collected data. The team will also develop scenario-base models to test and validate the different hospital policies for the use of PPE during Covid-19 outbreak. The intended immediate impact of this research is to inform healthcare workers about effective policies for PPE conservation that lead to optimal health outcomes for patients and staff during the Covid-19 pandemic. The findings and the data collected as a result of this work will be made available to the medical community as soon as possible to help manage the need for PPE. Specifically, PPE conservation policies will be compiled, and a paper immediately released to the medical community to broadly help conserve resources during the Covid-19 pandemic. In the longer term, the strategies developed to effectively mitigate resource consumption and climate impacts of healthcare activities will be shared with the medical and the wider academic communities. The results of this study target increased resilience of medical supply chain and healthcare operations during times of crisis, including future pandemics and climate related disasters, as well as a general increase in emissions mitigation by continuing reasonable resource conservation practices beyond the pandemic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1207	Andrea Hicks	University of Wisconsin-Madison	None	2020-06-01	2021-05-31	RAPID: Influence of reusable personal protective equipment on resilience of hospitals in a pandemic	Engineering - A major challenge in responding to the Covid-19 pandemic is keeping health care workers safe through the usage and supply of personal protective equipment (PPE). There is currently a severe shortage of PPE across health care facilities in the United States, in part due to a reliance on disposable PPE, which must be replenished. In order to increase the resiliency of the healthcare system, a fundamental shift for meeting the baseline demand of PPE may be met by utilizing reusable options. The main goal of this work is to generate new insight on the resilience of hospitals as a function of how they meet their baseline PPE demand, while informing hospitals how to increase their resiliency during this current pandemic, and engaging the public through crowd sourcing information as to the number of health care systems requesting citizen-made PPE. This project will quantify the equivalent life cycles of single use and reusable PPE, and the increase in the resiliency of a hospital as a function of its usage of reusable PPE in pandemic events. <br/><br/>Life cycle assessment will be coupled with agent based modeling to generate new fundamental insight as to the potential shifts in the resiliency of a hospital system due to the baseline usage of reusable PPE. These insights may help to weather the current pandemic and future anticipated pandemics. Disposable PPE and other medical supplies have been adopted largely out of a concern for healthcare acquired infections. However, in a time of great surges in demand, such as those which occur during a pandemic, this can result in a lack of available PPE due to competing demands from multiple hospitals and a lack of available supplies. The approach of the study is 3-fold: (1) generate comprehensive data as to the life cycle of reusable versus single use PPE in a pandemic setting, (2) create new insight as to the resiliency of hospitals as a function of meeting their baseload PPE demand with reusables, and (3) generate crowd sourced information as to the real time stability of hospital supply lines as a function of requests for citizen ? made PPE. This work proposes to assess the resiliency of a hospital due to surges in demand for PPE during a pandemic, and the ability of the hospital to meet those needs. This will result in new ways of evaluating the current debate between reusable and single use medical supplies in a crisis situation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

This award is made by the AISL program in the Division of Research on Learning, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The public must be made aware ? in a clear, responsible way ? about the role of science to help bring this pandemic under control and prevent future outbreaks. This project will allow the NewsHour to go beyond their daily reporting of the medical information about the pandemic, to inform the public about the difference scientific research/ research conducted by scientists and medical professionals can make in attacking such a dire threat. The PBS NewsHour has the capability to quickly mobilize its science journalists and national distribution infrastructure to produce at least six broadcast segments and additional digital materials reporting on this on-going scientific work. They will interview scientists, researchers and experts in genomic analysis, computer tracking, vaccine production, and social epidemiology showing what they are doing to test, treat, track and stop the spread of COVID-19, to create vaccines that may prevent further transmission, and to measure the social impact of the disease. These segments will be broadcast nationwide on local PBS stations and distributed on their website, YouTube, and social media channels. Viewership of the NewsHour is extensive reaching 2.5 million people nightly via broadcast and almost 33 million YouTube views per quarter. During a recent quarter, they reached 72.6 million on Facebook and garnered 86.8 million Twitter impressions. <br/><br/>The research team, Knology, will conduct a study to assess 1) where US adults are primarily getting information about COVID-19; 2) their perception of personal and public responsibility; 3) behaviors they have taken and/or plan to take, and when; 4) their social values. Knology will develop a survey instrument with adopted items and modules used in prior collaborations to develop a baseline understanding of the relationship between news consumption and attitudes about COVID-19 risk. The survey will be hosted using Qualtrics. Survey data will be gathered from a representative sample of US adults (N = 1000) recruited using the online software system, Prolific. A recent PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll will be used as a baseline. Once potentially identifying information like demographics are aggregated, these formative data and topline results will be shared openly through the Knology website to support other researchers and journalists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Most have also decided to pivot to online instruction so students can continue their education and remain on track in their degree programs. To accomplish this goal, faculty in all disciplines have scrambled to quickly move their in-person classes to an online environment. Many of these faculty have not had previous experience teaching online. Many who have experience are not fluent with either the technologies or the most effective methods for teaching and learning in online environments. This project will systematically explore the ways in which physics faculty members around the nation, under enormous time pressure, are interacting with each other in online networks as they transition their physics courses online. These online networks can also help faculty navigate the stresses of teaching online and the anxiety of ensuring that students have a beneficial educational experience. This project will gather and analyze data to describe the characteristics of these networks and how they may support the transition to online teaching of physics and other STEM disciplines during a crisis and beyond.<br/><br/>Academic and social networks are critical elements of student life in STEM, and they are also important for instructors. During this crisis, faculty are drawing on professional social networks to support their transition to online teaching. Additional research is needed to understand these informal faculty networks and to link these networks to outcomes for faculty and students. Because the coronavirus-related transition to online teaching has been so urgent and widespread, the situation presents a unique setting in which to apply techniques of social network analysis to study the roles of professional networks on a large scale within a discipline. To this end, the project will collect data from three primary components: (1) a survey of physics faculty as they transition to online teaching; (2) follow-up interviews with faculty; and (3) Twitter data-scraping to identify groups that are promoting and sharing approaches to online teaching. The three data sets will be connected and collectively contribute to analyses of network growth, resource sharing, personal community growth, and mediation of anxiety among college physics faculty. The study intends to reveal the extent to which the crisis has: 1) mobilized latent networks and formed new networks around physics teaching; 2) made such networks more salient and productive; 3) built faculty members' efficacy beliefs about their ability to teach physics online; and 4) mediated their anxiety about teaching online. In addition to revealing how faculty networks are localized and nationalized, the results can contribute to a greater understanding of how social networks influence instructional decision-making on different scales. If so, these results can inform future longitudinal studies of the persistence of educational transformations that occur during a crisis response, which may have generalizable application in understanding institutional change successes and failures.

Most have also decided to pivot to online instruction so students can continue their education and remain on track in their degree programs. To accomplish this goal, faculty in all disciplines have scrambled to quickly move their in-person classes to an online environment. Many of these faculty have not had previous experience teaching online. Many who have experience are not fluent with either the technologies or the most effective methods for teaching and learning in online environments. This project will systematically explore the ways in which physics faculty members around the nation, under enormous time pressure, are interacting with each other in online networks as they transition their physics courses online. These online networks can also help faculty navigate the stresses of teaching online and the anxiety of ensuring that students have a beneficial educational experience. This project will gather and analyze data to describe the characteristics of these networks and how they may support the transition to online teaching of physics and other STEM disciplines during a crisis and beyond.<br/><br/>Academic and social networks are critical elements of student life in STEM, and they are also important for instructors. During this crisis, faculty are drawing on professional social networks to support their transition to online teaching. Additional research is needed to understand these informal faculty networks and to link these networks to outcomes for faculty and students. Because the coronavirus-related transition to online teaching has been so urgent and widespread, the situation presents a unique setting in which to apply techniques of social network analysis to study the roles of professional networks on a large scale within a discipline. To this end, the project will collect data from three primary components: (1) a survey of physics faculty as they transition to online teaching; (2) follow-up interviews with faculty; and (3) Twitter data-scraping to identify groups that are promoting and sharing approaches to online teaching.

While virus transmission occurs via tiny aerosols, current mask coverings rely purely on passive filters; and can benefit from enhanced aerosol-collection and virus-inactivation mechanisms. We propose to engineer a highly-efficient, easy-to-use, cost-effective respirator design that will be significantly more efficient at capturing tiny aerosols. A combination of copper-based filters and an air-transmission passage inspired by nasal structures in animals with an enhanced sense of smell will facilitate droplet capture, followed by virus inactivation via thermal and ionic effects. The final respirator design will directly address the urgent global shortage and immediate national need for more effective masks. By preventing nosocomial transmission, the product can also be a critical game-changer for the healthcare community. For an accelerated concept-to-product transition, we will seek collaborations with virology labs and pharmaceutical companies for detailed testing with live COVID samples.<br/><br/>This collaborative project will engineer a novel, highly-efficient, virus-preventive respirator mask inspired by nasal structures in animals with enhanced olfactory sensitivity. Small aerosol droplets that can carry viruses will be captured from inhaled air by using a combination of copper-based filters and a bio-inspired tortuous passage with periodic thermal gradients induced by spiral copper wires. The aerosol capture will be articulated by modulating the dynamics of flow structures in the convoluted geometry (vortex trap) and by thermophoresis action along the respirator?s internal walls (thermal trap). Cyclic cold/hot temperature changes on the walls, along with ionic activity from the copper material, will be used to inactivate the trapped viruses. The use of these mechanisms is supported by published observations on earlier and current strains of coronavirus. The project will integrate the theoretical, experimental, and computational expertise of the principal investigators in optimizing the design for a new-age respirator, which can be radically more effective at preventing the transmission of COVID-19. To meet the urgent public need, the researchers will establish collaborations with pharmaceutical and manufacturing companies as well as university-based Biosafety Level ? 3 lab units for non-clinical in vivo testing and to ensure rapid prototype development of the proposed respirator masks.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Thermal Transport Processes program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1212	Paul Westerhoff	Arizona State University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Disinfection and Reuse of Health-Care Worker Facial Masks to Prevent Infection coronavirus disease	Engineering - Health care providers rely upon facial masks as a key element in protection against aerosol transmitted diseases such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is currently a severe shortage of respiratory masks leading to unprecedented changes in healthcare protocols, to not only not change masks between patients but reuse masks over several hours or days, against common medical practice and creating serious risks of cross-contamination of patients and infection of personnel. Fast and effective sanitizing methods are needed to allow for the safe reuse of masks to protect patients and health care workers alike. The novel protocols need to assure rapid destruction of the virus while not compromising the protection efficacy. This project aims at designing a novel germicidal ultraviolet light irradiation system using light emitting diodes coated with nanoparticles to maximize the irradiation efficiency. Nanoparticles enhanced irradiation sources will be optimized to assure a more equal distribution of the germicidal light dose across curved surfaces (such as molded masks), increasing the process speed, while decreasing the potential damage by excess radiation. Potential radiation damage to mask material will be investigated while mask performance will be carefully monitored. The project will yield a novel nanotechnology enhanced ultraviolet disinfection system, while also providing critically needed scientific data on ultraviolet damage potential of masks in general and impacts of irradiation on protection efficacy. The project will make immediate broader impacts as it partners with health care practitioners. The funding will support the training of minority, undergraduate and graduate students in applied nanotechnology.<br/><br/>The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has led to a severe shortage in respiratory protective equipment for health care providers. The quest for processes to rapidly sanitize facial masks for safe reuse revealed some scientific knowledge gaps and technological challenges, even for common processes such as Ultraviolet Light irradiation. Technologically, delivering uniform light dosages to curved surfaces such as masks, to minimize total radiation dose and potential material damage while saving time and energy remains a challenge. This project will use nano-enabled, durable ultraviolet -light emitting diodes connected to optical fibers to optimize delivery of ultraviolet doses to non-flat surfaces. Scientifically, little information exists on ultraviolet damage to facial masks and the impact on the capture efficiency of the masks. This project will characterize chemically the nature of the ultraviolet radiation to the mask materials while also investigating potential changes to particle collection efficiency of the material. The capture efficiency and hence protection efficacy is a nanoparticle issue (virions are ~125 nm), beyond simple physical size as particles will also be trapped by electrostatic interactions, particularly important at nanoscale. The latter is really poorly understood in the context of facial masks and impact of humidity, particle size and potential radiation induced material surface changes. This project will contribute to ultraviolet radiation technology development, nanoscale insights on nanoparticle trapping and particle filter interactions. The project will support minority, undergraduate and student graduate training and have immediate impacts by direct collaboration with health care practitioners.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Cecil	Oklahoma State University	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	RAPID: A Virtual Reality simulator to train first responders involved in health care efforts related to the COVID-19 virus outbreak	Computer and Information Science and Engineering - All health-care workers may not have the necessary background and training to handle contagious diseases, and different contagious diseases need different types of precautions to be taken. In this context, training these responders to handle the novel virus COVID-19 infected patients become paramount. This project involves the creation of a Virtual Reality based simulation environment to support training of first responders including nurses in hospitals, communities, and cities in the US in order to respond more effectively to the recent COVID-19 outbreak. The COVID-19 virus pandemic has placed an overwhelming strain on the Nation's ability to treat patients; the number of patients who need to be tested continues to rise (and is expected to increase substantially in the coming weeks and months). Currently, there is an urgent need to train such responders (nurses, physician assistants and others) to perform the screening/testing activities in a methodical, safe and efficient manner. By creating a Virtual Reality simulator for such training, this project will accomplish two objectives: (i) increase the pool of first responders involved in COVID-19 testing; and (ii) develop a more effective process to train and prepare such first responders. The simulator's training modules will also be used to introduce university students to the process of designing and building such Virtual Reality simulators for medical and healthcare contexts.<br/><br/>With the number of COVID-19 patients continuing to increase rapidly, it is critical that the Nation have a larger pool of trained first responders. The creation of such a Virtual Reality training simulator will address this urgent need. This innovative simulator will provide a user-friendly and effective training experience for the nurses and other health care assistants to perform various triage-related screening and testing activities. An interdisciplinary team of researchers including first responders, nurses and triage coordinators (from a hospital partner) will collaborate in a unique participatory design-based approach to designing and building this training simulator. With the involvement of COVID-19 first responders and medical specialists, an information centric process model (ICPM) will be created that captures the functional and temporal relationships of various activities involved in the triage-based patient interaction process including screening, testing, and treatment. The creation of such an ICPM will provide a robust and structured foundation to create the simulation environments, which will be distributed to hospitals nationwide. On-line workshops will be held (after creation of this simulator) to help with the use of this simulator by hospitals and clinics. Conference and workshop papers targeting medical and healthcare professionals will be presented to highlight the design and use of this training simulator.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Instructors and students, many of whom have limited experience teaching and learning online, have suddenly been immersed in an exclusively virtual learning experience. This shift has been accompanied by drastic limitations in students? daily activities, social interactions, and job opportunities. Given that the current disruption in the system is transient in nature, it is urgent to collect and analyze the data needed to understand the impact of the pandemic on undergraduate students. To this end, this project will examine the immediate and long-term impacts of the pandemic on undergraduate students? emotional well-being, day-to-day functioning, and learning. The study aims to provide insights on how disruptions can affect learners? stress, engagement, and learning outcomes both during the online learning experience and during the return to learning conditions that are similar to those prior to the disruption. Results from this project will help inform higher-education institutions and policymakers as they develop strategies to mitigate the effects on student learning resulting from the current pandemic and to plan responses for future disruptions. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand the longitudinal and dynamic impact of the pandemic on undergraduate STEM students? emotional states (such as stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and frustration), day-to-day life (such as social isolation, sedentariness, access to outdoor environments, and proximity to outbreak hotspots), and learning engagement and outcomes. Fluctuations in students? day-to-day functions and emotional states will be evaluated during and after the pandemic, using information from psychological surveys, interviews, computer vision-based analytics, and wearable sensors. Learning outcomes will be assessed using grades and self-evaluation of learning. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the resulting data will be used to understand the effects of the disruptions in daily life on students? emotional states and learning outcomes. This project aims to advance the STEM education community?s understanding of the relationship between disruptions in the education system and student learning, and potentially reveal characteristics that promote resilience of students during and following the acute stages of a crisis.

1216	Shalini Misra	Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	RAPID: Distancing & Digital Information in the Face of COVID-19	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - The COVID-19 pandemic poses arguably the most formidable set of health and broader societal challenges of the 21st century to people around the world. This project studies the judgements, perceptions, and behaviors that result from different types, quality, and amount of digital information and different social distancing restrictions in a high-stress context of spatial distancing over a prolonged period during the COVID-19 crisis. Such understanding can help us develop better strategies?including shaping the content and timeliness of online and offline communication of public policies?to respond more effectively to future large-scale crises that also may impose restrictions on the day-to-day, face-to-face human interactions that comprise the norm for modern society.<br/><br/>As large numbers of people cut off spatial ties and limit their mobility in the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for digital media has increased, not only to increase understanding of health and economic impacts and to reduce anxiety and uncertainty, but also to compensate for the severance of in person social interactions. This information comes from different sources, changes over time, and varies in quality, credibility, and timeliness. The research team hypothesizes that the nature of the information consumed and intensity of immersion in the digital environment during the COVID-19 pandemic can prompt different construals of the pandemic and thereby shape risk preferences and behaviors. The team investigates these perceptions, preferences, choices, and behavioral responses to spatial distancing public policies through a multiple wave, online panel study of 400 residents of the Washington-Arlington-Alexandria metropolitan area. The research uses construal level theory by empirically distinguishing between the spatial and psycho-social dimensions of the construct of psychological distancing and calibrating the psychological impacts of immersion in online environments during a period of limited in-person interactions. The team investigates how digital media and technology consumption influence construal level and how the interaction of these two factors shape individuals? risk perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors over time. Our research thus moves beyond simplistic explanations of the direct linkage between psychological distance, construal level, and judgments and decisions to a more nuanced understanding of interactions between construal mindsets and overload, stress, and fear.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1217	Michelle Shiota	Arizona State University	None	2020-04-15	2021-03-31	RAPID: Coping with COVID-19: Emotion Regulation Strategy Implications for Behavior, Social Outcomes, and Well-Being	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 is producing an extraordinary set of stressors and demands. The country is facing a life-threatening health crisis and associated economic fallout. That stress is exacerbated by unexpectedness, unpredictability, contradictory and uncertain information, and low personal control. At the same time, people are asked to adopt a series of unfamiliar social distancing and hygiene behaviors in an attempt to ?flatten the curve? of the coronavirus?s spread. Enacting the CDC-recommended behaviors requires both emotion regulation and effortful self-control. Research on emotion regulation ? the ways people attempt to alter or change their own emotions ? distinguishes among several strategies such as looking for a ?silver lining? in upsetting events, reaching out for social support, intellectualizing the problem, and distraction with television and games. The coronavirus pandemic provides a unique set of circumstances in which to examine how reliance on different emotion regulation strategies predicts people?s health-related behaviors and emotional well-being given these unusual circumstances. Findings from this research will inform future public policy recommendations that encourage health-promoting behaviors in stress-related situations. <br/><br/>This research examines the extent to which daily use of 16 distinct emotion regulation strategies predicts adoption/maintenance of CDC-recommended social distancing, hygiene and healthy social engagement behaviors. The research also examines how these emotion regulation strategies influence various prosocial and antisocial behaviors, psychological well-being, and loneliness. For three weeks, participants complete a daily questionnaire measuring their use of specific emotion regulation techniques that day; every seventh day they also answer questions about their behavior (e.g., mask-wearing, avoiding social gatherings, technology-mediated socializing, donating money or supplies, hoarding), as well as loneliness, anxiety, and depression, during the previous week. Data analyses will ask which emotion regulation strategies, or combinations of strategies, predict the most desirable profile of behavioral and well-being outcomes. The research tests important emotion regulation theories and their applicability within the unique coronavirus pandemic context and has the potential to inform future stress-related intervention efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1218	Michel Boufadel	New Jersey Institute of Technology	None	2020-04-15	2021-03-31	RAPID: Scaling, causality, and modulation of the spread of COVID19	Engineering - Models of the spreading of the COVID-19 virus have yielded conflicting predictions for the value and time of the peak occurrence of cases. Most models tend to be one dimensional exponential growth, and thus do not account for spatial correlation. Other models are based on neural networks, which are capable of predicting if sufficient data are available, which is not at this instant of time the case for COVID-19. This study will use multifractals, which result from multiplicative processes with spatial correlations. Multifractals, due to their lack of a characteristic scale, may be ideal tools to analyze the spread of viruses, such as COVID-19; the spreading in a large city such as NYC could be similar to that occurring in a small city such as Newark, NJ. Multifractals have been used largely for geophysical data by various groups, and in some cases, to understand the spread of viruses, such as H1N5. This study will use data from the five boroughs of New York City and from Northern New Jersey (namely Bergen, Essex, and Union County). The team already has been collecting data from these communities in a project on community resilience. <br/><br/>The hypothesis of this research is that multifractals can reflect both the scaling behavior and the exponential increase with time. Multifractals also account for the spatial correlation between subjects, and thus could be used to explain connectivity, be it at the individual level or at the level of cities (say NYC and Philadelphia). In addition, a look at the map of cases at the US (or the world scale) reveals spottiness, that is hot zones that are not uniformly distributed in space. The study team believes that the skeleton of the geometry is fractal (because of the lack of scale), and thus will be analyzing multifractals distributed spatially on a fractal network. This approach may open new modes of investigation in various areas, including public health and resilience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

The models will also provide a means to test the impact of social distancing and mobility reduction on the future course of the pandemic. The proposed modeling framework relies on a two-component structure that does not require prior knowledge of the epidemiological characteristics of the disease. This approach is especially useful during the initial stages of an emerging outbreak, where little is known and validated about the contagion. Moreover, this project will bring a novel perspective on the mathematical modeling of disease spread, which will complement other ongoing efforts and provide access to diverse models critical to decision-making under uncertainty.<br/><br/>This project builds upon a data-driven mathematical modeling approach leveraging a surprisingly simple behavior examined in epidemiological data sets and models that allows forecasts for case counts with no parameter estimations. The first thrust is to integrate data-driven modeling into explicit network interactions in order to investigate spatial aspects of COVID-19 outbreak propagation. The second thrust of the project is to implement a calibration layer that takes into account mitigation efforts. The rationale for this approach is that, in a constantly evolving environment, epidemiological predictions are difficult to make due to the performativity effect, whereby model predictions affect social behavior and mitigation efforts, which in turn alters the spread of the outbreak predicted by the mathematical models. From a conceptual point of view, this project will address performativity in the context of epidemiological modeling. At the practical level, it will develop a general calibration module that will learn how to incorporate reactions to predictions into epidemiological forecasts. By design, this ?performativity-aware? calibration module will be independent of any specific epidemic model; hence, once developed, it will be possible to be integrated into other existing predictive models.<br/><br/>This award is being funded by the CARES supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

COVID-19 directly affects the physical, financial, and psychological well-being of those who live in close proximity to the outbreak areas. Because of its potential threat to physical health, it has widespread effects on the thought processes and behaviors of the global population. This project seeks to understand the impact of COVID-19 by examining how it affects workers? perceptions of the health-related threat, their emotional and motivational reactions towards the threat, and their downstream work-related behaviors. This project will analyze workers? anxiety and desire to make a lasting and meaningful impact to their environment as different reactions towards COVID-19. These reactions, in turn, can lead to different levels of work performance, helping behaviors, and withdrawal from the workplace. Importantly, the project will test if and how the organizational context may play an important role in encouraging effective versus dysfunctional coping among workers when facing threats related to COVID-19. Results from the project will enhance understanding of how workers react to health-related threat information, and how their productivity and well-being may be affected by the information. Results will also equip organizations with knowledge to create a context that will help employees adapt to the threat brought on by COVID-19 or other similar life-threatening crises. More broadly, this project will clarify how organizations and managers can transform negative crises and challenges into opportunities to boost workforce morale and prosocial motivation. <br/><br/>The goal of the proposed research is to understand the impact of COVID-19 among working adults within the context of the pandemic. The project conceptualizes COVID-19 as a salient mortality cue and will analyze individual employees? adaptive reflection and maladaptive anxiety as responses to this cue. The project will also analyze how reflection may be related to employees? positive coping behaviors such as productivity and helping, whereas anxiety as a maladaptive reaction may be associated with negative behaviors such as withdrawal. Finally, the project will examine the organizational contextual factors that may exacerbate or ameliorate workers? reactions towards the threat of COVID-19. The project will consider organizational health climate, ethical leadership, and corporate social responsibility practices as critical factors that may promote the adaptive reactions towards COVID-19. The project will use time-lagged, three-wave surveys to collect data from working adults; structural equation modeling and conditional indirect effect tests will be employed to evaluate research questions. Findings from the project will inform organizational theories related to those involving terror management and generativity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

The multitude of diverse COVID-19-related data streams, which are rapidly made available online with little coordination or reliance on common standards, creates enormous challenges for researchers trying to answer such questions today, and analyze and predict patterns of the pandemic in its cross-disciplinary complexity. This project will do so by linking diverse information about pathogens, health data, and environmental indicators into a common knowledge graph, to let researchers trace the virus in different geographic conditions and provide input into effective intervention policies. <br/><br/>The core technical component of the project is a COVID-19 knowledge graph, which represents linked facts about different aspects of the pandemic, from scientific literature and large data collections and models. The project will develop a novel methodology for creating a knowledge graph from disparate sources describing pathogens, population health, environmental conditions, and critical infrastructure components. The graph will be created in coordination with several partner projects working on the NSF Open Knowledge Network. This will ensure that additional knowledge domains can be integrated to support cross-disciplinary analysis. The results of the collaborative knowledge network development will be published as a continuously updated online dashboard for the general public and a collection of Jupyter Notebooks, open source software to enable interactive computing, to help researchers explore various aspects of the knowledge graph and improve our understanding of how the virus is spread and what intervention strategies are potentially most effective.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1222	Peggy Giordano	Bowling Green State University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC: PREDICTORS AND CONSEQUENCES OF COMPLIANCE WITH SOCIAL DISTANCING RECOMMENDATIONS	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - The need for social distancing measures implemented in the wake of the novel coronavirus pandemic is well established, but few studies have examined variability in compliance with this public health recommendation. It is particularly important to understand the social factors associated with this variability. This project builds on an ongoing longitudinal study of the life and relationship experiences of a large, diverse sample of young people interviewed first as adolescents, and subsequently interviewed multiple times as they have become adults. This provides an opportunity to interview these women and men to understand the process of navigating the guidelines, including: a) what factors predict more and less compliant responses to the social distancing guidelines; and b) what are the consequences of social distancing for emotional health, behavioral health, and relationship functioning. The findings of the project will alert researchers and policymakers to the myriad of personal and background characteristics that are associated with more or less compliance. This information will allow for the crafting of more effective public policies and messaging about social distancing, with the goal of promoting faster and more complete compliance during future pandemics. <br/><br/>Social distancing is a vital tool in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, but we know little about who complies with guidelines and who does not. This project will draw on six waves of previously collected survey data (n=1,321) from the Toledo Adolescent Relationships Study (TARS) and a new COVID-19 online survey that will be administered to all respondents. These longitudinal data provide a unique opportunity to examine precursors and consequences of variations in response to the current social distancing guidelines. The design also includes in-depth phone interviews with a subset of respondents who were compliant (n=25) and others who did not change behavior or failed to comply consistently (n=25). The qualitative component will provide help to understand compliance as a process, and develop insights about the role of social networks in either encouraging or minimizing the need to comply. In addition to assessing the role of sociodemographic characteristics, the project will analyze the effects of prior adverse childhood and adolescent experiences, economic and social uncertainties, and network embeddedness as influences on levels of compliance. The availability of previous measures of social and behavioral health and prior relationship circumstances will allow the project to determine effects of social distancing and the experience of the pandemic, controlling for prior background. The project will also examine whether consistent reports of depression at prior waves exacerbate or dampen the effect of the recent experience of social distancing. The emphasis on social determinants provides a counterpoint to approaches that conceptualize compliance with health-promoting recommendations as an individualistic, largely cognitive process, and more broadly, will contribute to the emerging science of behavior change. Findings will inform sociological theories regarding identity and symbolic interaction, as well as theories of inequality, especially within the context of extreme events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

The binding of the viral spike protein to a receptor protein (called the angiotensin converting enzyme 2, or ACE2) is the first step in the infection of the human host cell. Blocking or inhibiting this interaction could stop the invasion of the human cell by this highly infectious virus. With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes program is supporting the research of Dr. Xiaohong Tan at Bowling Green University in Bowling Green, Ohio to create DNA aptamers to inhibit this initial step of viral invasion. Aptamers are short sequences of DNA that fold into a shape that matches that of a target molecule, thereby keeping other molecules from binding. These DNA aptamers are ?designed? by successive selection of molecules from large mixtures of different sequences, resulting in a few sequences that keep all other DNAs from binding the target. Dr. Tan uses this selection process to find DNA aptamers that bind tightly to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Two of more of the identified DNA aptamers are linked together to create ?super binders? that are much better at inhibiting the interaction than would any single aptamer. Constructing DNA aptamers that block the invasion of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells may lead to the design of antiviral agents that help lessen the infectivity that causes the COVID-19 pandemic. Educational and training activities will focus on postdoctoral researchers learning cutting edge techniques in chemical biology on a ?front line? research problem. The team is developing ways to communicate their science to the public, to K-12 institutions, and to other research groups using distance learning technologies.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop polymeric molecules (fusion DNA aptamers) that significantly interact with the binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. The objective is to effectively block the virus from binding to the specific ACE2 receptor, thereby blocking the entry of the virus into human cells and, as a result, its ability to cause COVID-19 infections. Professor Tan uses SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) to identify individual aptamers that interact with three distinct regions on the cell binding domain of the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. The affinities of aptamers to their targets are measured through standard binding assays. These individual high affinity DNA aptamers are connected together using nucleic acid or chemical linkers to make fusion aptamers that have affinities comparable to those of antibodies. The ability of these fused DNA aptamer ?super binders? to effectively block this interaction is tested against a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using standard technologies, as well as live SARS-CoV-2 through collaboration with the University of Toledo Medical School.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

This RAPID project will study how at-risk adolescents and their parents experience COVID-19 in the initial time period following the novel coronavirus pandemic. The research will compare adolescents? sleep, social skills, social relationship quality, stress, mood, substance use, mental health symptoms, physical health, psychosocial development, externalizing behavior, and delinquency across the COVID-19 outbreak. The project also will examine whether juvenile incarceration exacerbates the potential impact of COVID-19 on youth outcomes. <br/><br/>The project will engage in a longitudinal study of at-risk (justice-involved, low-SES) adolescents to address how adolescent-parent dyads respond to and are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This research will use multiple methods, including self-report, collateral report, official records from the partnering department of probation, electronic daily diary reports, and actigraph technology, to assess changes in adolescents? and parents? functioning on a variety of outcomes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings will evince physical and mental health risks in response to the pandemic among at-risk youth. As well, the research will provide best practices for juvenile detention facilities and departments of probation in times of crises to ensure that youth continue to receive important rehabilitative services while maintaining the health and safety of youth, legal actors, and community members. Results will contribute to the limited existing knowledge base on the needs, risks, and potential protective factors of a vulnerable group of youth during a global state of emergency.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1225	Konstantin Sobolev	University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Superhydrophobic and Photocatalytic Antimicrobial (SPA) Coatings	Engineering - The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in drastic socioeconomic, educational, political and cultural impacts worldwide. Despite the measures currently undertaken, the latest projections of COVID-19 death toll range upwards of 100,000 across the U.S. The World Health Organization considers the main route of COVID-19 transmission to be through contact with surfaces that have been contaminated with small respiratory droplets that are released when COVID-19 patients cough or exhale. The virus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) retains infectivity on stainless steel surfaces for up to 72 hours, and the current absence of a vaccine and effective antiviral drugs makes it critical to explore novel approaches to breaking the chain of viral transmission. The project focuses on design and initial laboratory and field testing of a spray coating technology that can be applied to a variety of surfaces to both repel virus-laden droplets and photocatalytically deactivate viral pathogens that lodge on coated surfaces. More broadly, the project supports graduate and undergraduate training in the areas of surface coating technology and catalysis, and also engages local hospitals and university medical research facilities in assessing the efficacy of the coating technologies for combating a broad range of airborne pathogens.<br/><br/>Specifically, the research investigates the pathogen inhibiting efficacy of superhydrophobic and photocatalytic antimicrobial (SPA) coatings, a group of sprayable materials which, through their combined modes of action, can confer self-disinfecting properties to a wide array of surfaces, such as metals, concrete, ceramics, glass, and wood, to help prevent the transmission of viral, bacterial, and other pathogens for a prolonged duration of time, ranging from several months to several years. The SPA coatings represent a novel two-pronged approach to repelling and deactivating viral pathogens. The coatings consist of nano-TiO2 and ZnO siloxane-modified superhydrophobic layers that serve to repel respiratory droplets, thus minimizing the ability of pathogens to linger on surfaces, while also facilitating cleaning procedures. The superhydrophobic layers are intermixed with TiO2, ZnO, and Ti-phosphate layers that impart photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic material has potential to deactivate any pathogens that remain on the surface through the release of hydroxyl radicals. Doping of the materials with cuprous compounds further enhances the antimicrobial effect. Efficacy against the COVID-19 virus is the primary justification for the urgency of the research, which will proceed in parallel via both lab and field testing. Beyond the immediate impact on the current pandemic, the resulting technology will improve our nation?s preparedness for future waves of the same virus or other airborne pathogens. In addition, data obtained during the current pandemic will provide a fast track to scale-up, manufacturing and widespread deployment of the anti-viral coatings.<br/><br/>This award is being funded by the CARES Act supplemental funds allocated to ENG and MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

These changes in behavior are placing extraordinary demands on the Internet. This project will measure the Internet?s ability to meet these demands, including comparing its performance before, during, and after the peak of COVID-19; whether the amount of change varies between areas heavily impacted by COVID-19 and those less impacted; and whether and how large networks adapt.<br/><br/>To provide this rich understanding, this project will combine multiple Internet-scale datasets that provide complementary views to investigate how responses to COVID-19 have impacted the Internet and how networks have reacted. Specifically, the project will measure how workloads have changed and their impact on networks in response to COVID-19 by measuring traffic patterns worldwide and the impact of congestion on performance globally. In addition, the project will measure how networks react to these changes in workloads by monitoring path changes that indicate rerouting of traffic during surges induced by measures in response to COVID-19, identifying whether traffic management is deployed for (de)prioritizing certain network flows, and measuring whether networks add interconnections and upgrade capacity. <br/><br/>Measuring the network impact of COVID-19 will illuminate the Internet?s strengths and weak points and is a crucial step towards improving the Internet?s future resilience in the face of pandemics, natural disasters, large scale conflict, and terrorist attacks. The Internet is designed for resiliency, but large cloud and content providers have been avoiding public Internet exchange points and the public Internet in favor of private interconnection and private wide-area networks. This project will understand the impact of these decisions. The relative performance of these strategies under stress should play a critical role in informing future research, funding, and design of critical Internet infrastructure. <br/><br/>All of the data, measurement tools, and analysis code used for this study will be published to the greatest extent permitted by our affiliated organizations and prevailing data privacy regulations, with links to these artifacts posted at<br/>https://covid19-internet-resilience.github.io/. The goal is to keep these artifacts publicly available in perpetuity via free storage and cloud repositories, though the duration is subject to the availability of such resources. The tools and code will be maintained for as long as they remain useful for measuring Internet resilience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1227	Vesselin Shanov	University of Cincinnati Main Campus	None	2020-06-01	2021-05-31	RAPID: Design, Fabrication, and Testing a Prototype of Heatable Face Mask for Preventing Respiratory Diseases Contracted through Airborne	Engineering - Currently, there is a significant shortage of Personal Protective Equipment, particularly face masks, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The statistic shows that one COVID-19 patient consumes on average 17 face masks per day worn by the medical personnel. The pandemic is also affecting personnel in military and correction facilities. The post COVID-19 forecast describes that the face masks will be required long after the infection and death toll curve is flattened and declines. Wearing face masks will become a new norm for a long period of time at workplaces, shopping centers, and public events. Simultaneously, with the huge demand, face mask prices are increasing dramatically. This project is targeting the design and fabrication of a prototype of heatable and reusable face mask that can kill viruses caught on the mask surfaces thus preventing their penetration within the human respiratory system. This is achieved through resistive heating above the virus lethal temperature. A thin and breathable hater film made of engineered carbon nanomaterials will be used, which is porous and can be retrofitted or placed on the outer surface of any commercial face mask. This heatable filter is powered by a portable battery or a cell phone and is thermally insulated from facial skin. The mask can be energized when worn by the user or in storage to disinfect it. Faculties with diverse background as well as undergraduate and graduate students, and eventually some industries, will be involved in this project. <br/><br/>The main objective of the proposal is to fabricate and test a heatable and porous carbon nanotube air filter incorporated into a commercially available N95 respirator or other face masks that are suitable for healthcare workers dealing with pathogens. The Joule heating is generated by a thin film consisting of a few layers of carbon nanotube sheet drawn from vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays, however other carbon nanotube sheet materials like Bucky paper can be also employed. The performance temperature directly on the surface of the porous carbon nanotube heater is designed not to exceed 85 °C, which will be enough to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. The selected breathable insulating layers will attenuate this temperature down to the harmless 37 °C when wearing the heated mask. A second mode of the mask operation is proposed here when the protective equipment after use is activated by heating for 30 seconds which will disinfect the stored mask for reuse. The objective of this proposal will be achieved by pursuing the following aims: (a) design and fabricate a breathable carbon nanotube heater that is flexible and requires low voltage for powering via a portable battery or cell phone; (b) integrate the porous carbon nanotube heater into commercial masks; (c) test the air flow rate and the effectiveness of the mask to inactivate virus surrogates, and its safety to be worn. The intellectual merit of the proposed work is seen in the merging of a porous carbon nanotube heater with a conventional face mask, thus converting it to a reusable Personal Protective Equipment, which is proposed here for the first time. This mask does not have an alternative among other commercial face protective equipment. The broader impact of this proposal can be found in the multipurpose use of the invented face mask, which is expected to be beneficial not only for healthcare providers, but also for military personnel exposed to biological weapons, as well as for the general public preventing viruses causing COVID-19. Faculties with diverse background as well as undergraduate and graduate students, and eventually some industries, will be involved in this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1228	Joseph Mihaljevic	Northern Arizona University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Real-time modeling of the source-sink dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in rural regions for equitable public health	Biological Sciences - SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has become a global epidemic, spreading rapidly through communities across our country and around the globe. Accurate forecasting of disease spread is a critical tool for effectively planning outbreak responses, allowing us to predict how many people will be infected, how many patients will be in hospitals at any given time, and the resource needs (e.g. ventilators) at each hospital. Most modeling studies of SARS-CoV-2 have so far focused on predicting how the virus will spread in densely populated cities like New York City, but the virus is also rapidly spreading in more sparsely populated, rural regions. To accurately model outbreak dynamics in more rural areas, more realistic mathematical models are needed that can represent mid-sized population centers separated by large areas of low population density. This project will develop and refine these more advanced mathematical models to understand how population density and interconnectedness influence the trajectory of epidemic outbreaks. Importantly, the project will deploy model projections in near-real-time to aid in local public health interventions, via a secure web portal accessible to local and regional response planners. Model output will also be linked to the resources available at specific local and regional hospitals in a broad rural area, so that these hospitals can better manage the impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. The modeling system and web application will serve as a framework for rapidly responding to future outbreaks. <br/><br/>Most epidemiological models that have been developed to forecast the spread of SARS-CoV-2 make assumptions that are likely only realistic in dense urban centers, such as frequency-dependent transmission dynamics, a lack of stochastic processes, and a lack of density-dependent effects. In this project, models will be developed that are more appropriate for sparse metapopulations, accounting for multiple sources of stochasticity, population movement across a landscape, density-dependent transmission, and spatial heterogeneity in transmission rates. The project will use advanced statistical computing algorithms to fit the models to data from a large rural region. This fitting routine will identify the most appropriate transmission functions that describe longitudinal patterns of case-counts and will allow the project to release data-informed predictions of SARS-CoV-2 spread in near-real-time. These model forecasts will be developed in collaboration with public health experts and healthcare practitioners to respond to the needs of under-served, rural communities. The secure web application will provide predictions of hospitalization rates at fine spatial grains so that already strained, rural hospital systems can adapt and plan under different intervention scenarios.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

This research will develop and analyze data-driven mathematical models to predict the spread and evaluate the success of various public health intervention strategies to control COVID-19 in the US and abroad. The models will account for the characteristics of the pathogen, the variation of transmission that occur within community and in hospital settings, and geographical difference in transmission.

The study measures pandemic-related health experiences including knowledge, behaviors, and experiences (e.g. exposure, contagion, testing), the economic impacts of the pandemic containment measures, and the social and psychological changes related to stress, anxiety, and psychological well-being that have occurred. It analyzes the degree to which the social and psychological outcomes are related directly to the pandemic?s health impacts and to the extent which these are affected through the pandemic?s disruption of the economy. Then, in turn it studies how the levels of stress as well as social and psychological well-being affect health-related behaviors and health outcomes. This knowledge helps inform, and possibly improves, efforts to mitigate the disruptions of the current pandemic and leads to the development of better programs and responses to future pandemics.<br/><br/>These research goals are achieved through a longitudinal and comparative design incorporating baseline measurements from both NORC studies during earlier periods of national turmoil and disruption and from recent, more normal times based on NORC?s General Social Survey. Using NORC?s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel®, a nationally representative sample of 2,000 adults are interviewed immediately and then re-interviewed twice in following months.

With little time to prepare, water resource and hydrology professors and lecturers must generate online content rapidly for at least the spring and summer semesters of 2020, with an increasing possibility this format will extend into the fall 2020 term. At the same time, there is large variation in access to and preparation for online delivery among institutions and individual faculty.

It is importance to understand which aspects of the culturally engaging project foster a computer science identity and persistence among the youth.<br/><br/>The goal of the STEM Illinois project is to create a unique ecosystem that will nurture future computer scientists in industry and the academy. This project will provide underrepresented students with computer science activities that include using spatial analysis to map communities vulnerable to COVID-19, coding, big data analysis, artificial intelligence, data visualization, math, algorithms, and access to a recording studio to represent computer science concepts using art and music. Students will receive unprecedented access to mentors and professional experiences that include interviewing industry/academic computing scientists for podcasts, giving TEDxYouth talks about their experiences with computer science, questions and answer sessions with Nobel Prize Winners, etc. This project will increase the number of marginalized students majoring in Computer Science and Information Technology at the University of Illinois and around the country. The goal is also to increase the number of students in computer science internships and jobs at large companies such as State Farm, American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) and Microsoft (workforce development). The project will be evaluated using pre- and post-tests surveys, interviews, and participant observation. The project will use the Computer Science Attitude and Identity Survey (or a similar instrument) that includes questions about how confident a person feels about their computer science skills and how much interest they have in computer science as a profession.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1236	Kimberly Prather	University of California-San Diego Scripps Inst of Oceanography	None	2020-04-15	2021-03-31	RAPID: Aerosolization of Viruses and Bacteria in the Coastal Atmosphere	Geosciences - This RAPID project will investigate the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent of the COVID-19 disease, in coastal waters near an area of sewage outflow. The flow of sewage can become trapped in the surf zone, the region where waterborne species can be transferred into the atmosphere. Any viruses released in small sea spray droplets can remain airborne for hours, and recent research has demonstrated that the aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 virus can remain infectious for up to 3 hours. Thus residents in nearby regions could be exposed to the virus through this unanticipated atmospheric pathway.<br/><br/>Airborne samples will be collected near the US-Mexican border where millions of gallons of untreated sewage from the Tijuana River have been flowing into the ocean continuously for the last 5 months. The samples will be tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by the RTqPCR laboratory technique, and subject to metagenomic and metatranscriptomic DNA and RNA sequencing. The data will be visualized using a map created in collaboration with the UC San Diego WIFIRE team showing the locations in which SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses and bacteria are detected in air samples, providing critical unprecedented information on the spatial distribution of the airborne microbiome. The plan is for the air samples to be collected before and after COVID-19 becomes widespread in Tijuana, the source region of the raw sewage. This will enable the researchers to examine the relationship between the airborne distribution of SARS-CoV-2 and the distribution of confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases. This project will help to answer questions such as: Which strains of viruses, bacteria, and other sewage-related pollutants are released in sea spray aerosol in a coastal environment? How do ocean concentrations of enteric viruses and bacteria and conditions (swell, flow, wind speed) affect airborne concentrations? Do traditional water indicators of fecal contamination provide any link with airborne concentrations of bacteria and enteric viruses? Are there ?hot spots? where certain strains of viruses and bacteria are detected in higher abundance in the atmosphere (such as near the mouth of the Tijuana River)?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1237	Justin Boutilier	University of Wisconsin-Madison	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Investigating Performance of an Online Platform for Matching Supply and Demand for Medical Equipment During the COVID-19 Pandemic	Engineering - The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a sudden surge in demand for medical supplies, including personal protective equipment (PPE) necessary to protect first responders and healthcare workers. This surge has exposed gaps in the established supply chains for procurement of such equipment, leading medical facilities, particularly those that lack the scale to buy equipment in large quantities, to face shortages. In response, small-scale suppliers have emerged that can redirect idle design and manufacturing capacity for non-essential equipment to production of critical medical equipment. In collaboration with the University of Wisconsin Makerspace, the PIs have created an online platform that has enabled this fragmented and inherently temporary supply chain to efficiently match small-scale suppliers with hospitals in need of supplies. This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project supports valuable data collection efforts about participating manufacturers, medical facilities, and overall system performance of the online matching platform. These data will improve understanding of the role that pop-up supply chains can play in addressing supply shortages during pandemics and other nationwide emergencies.<br/><br/>The online platform is driven by an optimization algorithm that efficiently matches buyers with sellers by order size, price, lead time, etc. The PIs will collect and archive data from the platform on manufacturer characteristics (size, capacity, lead times, location, etc.), medical facility characteristics (size, type, requirements, urgency, etc.), and match logistics available through the platform, and will perform follow-up surveys to gather information on impact of the matching system and the effects on business operations. These data will be used to understand performance of the matching platform during the COVID-19 pandemic, identify factors that influence whether a recommended match leads to a successful transaction, understand the impact of quality variability on pop-up supply chain performance, and study the impact of improving the optimization algorithm on supply chain performance. The project will involve a graduate student who will gain valuable experience in designing optimization methods for effective supply chain design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1238	Gregory Voth	University of Chicago	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Data-driven Multiscale Integrative Model of the Coronavirus Virion	Mathematical and Physical Sciences - Gregory Voth of the University of Chicago is supported by this RAPID award to develop and deploy multiscale models of the entire SARS-CoV-2 virus, the virus that causes the novel coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19). Such multiscale models, at both the atomistic and coarse grain levels, contribute greatly to our understanding of how this virus replicates. Molecular simulations of viral processes in COVID-19 are useful to identify possible weaknesses in the viral life cycle. This research focuses on the dynamics of coronavirus processes, including the conformational transitions that are required for the virus to function. The project has three main foci: 1) all-atom simulations of individual viral proteins that are essential to the viral life cycle; 2) a coarse-grain models to a holistic understanding of entire virion (the virus outside the host cell) and its large scale processes, such as fusion of virions with host cells; and 3) machine-learning-based approaches to link the all-atom and coarse grain models and further refine their accuracy. As part of a larger, international community working on COVID-19, all data, models and analysis code will be made publicly available as soon as they are developed, including through the NSF-funded Molecular Science Software Institute (MolSSI). The complete multiscale picture of virus structure and dynamics will be used to identify potential target sites for drug development and other therapeutic strategies.<br/><br/><br/>The research in this RAPID project is for the development and application of multiscale computer simulation methods to characterize key elements of large-scale viral processes in SARS-CoV-2 replication. To achieve this goal there are three main objectives: (1) to characterize the dynamical behavior of essential viral proteins involved using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and understand the conformational transitions necessary for their function; (2) to develop and model the complete SARS-CoV-2 virion using coarse-grained simulation methods; and (3) to develop machine learning based approaches that systematically link atomic-level and coarse-grained simulation scales, and facilitate the generation of even more accurate and descriptive coarse-grained models. This research focuses on several biomolecular systems that are urgently needed to understand and characterize the transmission and propagation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including the spike protein that mediates entry of the viral particles into host cells, the host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2, which binds the spike protein, coronavirus protease which catalyzes viral processes, and other viral protein components, especially as structural data and biochemical information are released in the next few months. Coarse-grained simulations will focus on the urgent need to develop a holistic model of the entire SARS-CoV-2 virion as well as its large-scale processes such as the fusion of virions with host cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1239	Gourab Ghoshal	UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: A fast and scalable method to improve epidemiological models for COVID-19	Computer and Information Science and Engineering - The current COVID-19 pandemic is prompting the scientific community to improve the epidemiological models currently employed to understand the spread of infectious diseases. Current models divide a population of individuals into compartments, such as, susceptible, exposed but non-infectious, asymptomatic but infectious, symptomatic and infectious, recovered, and deceased. To simplify the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases, the prevailing assumption is that individuals in the same compartment behave identically. One way to add sophistication to these so-called compartmental models is by categorizing individuals in a more fine-grained manner, thus adding more compartments. This results in more parameters added to a model. Estimating these parameters requires more data, and more data increases the computational cost of estimating the parameters. In addition, as this pandemic is showing, our access to data is varied. Within each country and municipality, different sampling strategies are being pursued. This project lowers the computational cost of setting up and updating complex, compartmental epidemiological models as more data becomes available. By doing so, the project improves the ability of the scientific community to make more accurate predictions on the spread of the virus and inform on the effectiveness of local policy decisions on mitigation strategies. <br/><br/>The investigators adopt a category of model fitting that has seen recent success in molecular dynamics simulations in molecular modeling ? maximum entropy biasing methods. These methods replace model parameter optimization with a minimal biasing term that is independent of the model parameters. This makes the runtime complexity of model optimization linear with the amount of data and independent of the unknown number of parameters. The activities will enable rapid optimization of complex models that additionally consider spatial resolution and sampling biasing. The improved cost of the optimization process will permit frequent updates of compartmental models without the need for full parameter optimization each time new data is observed. The investigators will collaborate closely with others in the rapidly coalescing COVID-19 research community by releasing code, data, and findings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

We generate information useful to policymakers and local authorities and offer near-real-time state-by-state disease tracking. Our data allow officials to understand where the virus is currently spreading, facilitating improved allocation of resources. We also evaluate the networked nature of the disease, tracking its flow based on the reported social relationships of the survey participants and their social distancing behaviors. The project captures how well the information and communication needs of Americans are met during this crisis, observes patterns of citizen compliance with government recommendations, stay-at-home orders, and enforced lockdowns, and assesses their impact on suppressing the spread of the virus among diverse populations.<br/><br/>The project has two core objectives: (1) producing information that will be immediately useful in improving the national response to COVID-19; and (2) using COVID-19 data to understand how people adapt to and make sense of a national crisis that has important and immediate ramifications for their daily lives. We rely on a large-scale, rolling national survey that is conducted on a daily basis, with approximately 3000 respondents per day. We also link the survey data to the social media behavior of respondents. The large sample sizes collected daily offers near-real-time state-by-state disease tracking, as well as the ability to observe key differences in responses to policies across demographic groups. The design will capture how people use technology to work, get informed, and stay connected, and respondents? financial difficulties, employment experiences, and parenting and educational challenges in response to the pandemic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1241	Brian Mailloux	Barnard College	None	2020-07-01	2021-06-30	RAPID: Examining How Access to Green Space Impacts Subjective Well-Being During the COVID-19 Pandemic	Engineering - The aim of this project is to explore the connections among green space, perception of risk, and well-being in times of a public health emergency that require people to stay indoors and isolated. In a crisis like the current COVID-19 pandemic, the role of urban green spaces in promoting public health and well-being may be an especially important co-benefit of green infrastructure (GI) programs. However, there is simultaneous acknowledgement that being outdoors, even in green space, is a continuing source of risk for exposure and/or spread of COVID-19. Therefore, this research asks, how do variations in access to green space, whether due to lack of safe, nearby green space and/or the perceived risk associated with being outdoors in particular kinds of spaces during a public pandemic, impact well-being? To answer these questions, this study uses online surveys and video interviews with college students. These students have traveled home from their campuses, returning to a wide variety of residential and landscape forms, presenting an opportunity to conduct comparative study of how access to green space influences responses to current conditions and well-being. The survey, distributed via email, includes questions about well-being, outdoor activity, risk perception, and personal responses to social distancing/self-isolation measures. Interviewees, solicited from survey participants, will be asked questions about available outdoor green space and activity, lifestyle changes in response to COVID-19 and their effect on well-being, the role of outdoor activity in subjects' well-being, and barriers to outdoor activity under present circumstances. Both statistical analyses and qualitative coding analyses will be used to determine (a) subjects' access to different types of green space; (b) subjects' willingness to utilize green space with respect to type, accessibility, and risk perception; and (c) the association of (a) and (b) with subjects' well-being during the pandemic. <br/><br/>This study will expand knowledge on the co-benefits of green infrastructure (GI) programs, with an emphasis on the co-benefit of health and well-being during times of great stress. This study will allow determination of the impacts on well-being for a wide-range of green space types and accessibility, across and within landscape forms (urban, suburban, rural). As such, this study will contribute to understandings of how novel, large-scale stress-inducing events intersect with differences in green space type and access to contribute to inequalities in human well-being. By collecting data from a diverse study population located across a broad area this study will be able to make comparisons across a range of green space types and access. This will further understanding of the mechanisms by which green space affects well-being, applicable to a range of fields like public health, civil engineering, urban ecology, and urban design and planning. This research will address two primary broader implications for well-being in the face of current and future global pandemic-related challenges. First, this study examines how green space access affects well- being during social distancing/stay-at-home conditions, such as those experienced by more than three-fifths of the US population. Second, this study will provide detailed information on subjects' choices and behaviors regarding outdoor recreation during social distancing/stay-at-home conditions, including risk perception and beliefs about the importance of green space access. Together these data will be used to inform current and future preparations and responses to pandemics and other extreme emergency circumstances through recommendations on outdoor recreation, well-being, and current and future planned GI design. Attention to characteristics of neighborhoods by type of building and by population characteristics will support GI planning and implementation by providing fine spatial resolution for the integration of GI contributions to well-being with GI contributions to stormwater management and other environmental benefits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1242	Christina Chan	Michigan State University	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	RAPID: Integrative analysis of multi-omics data to understand ACE2 regulation and cytokine storm	Engineering - Many drugs are being tested for efficacy against COVID-19. The side effects of these drugs are poorly understood. The issue is complicated because a number of organ systems (lungs, heart, liver) can be affected by the infection. In addition, underlying conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease increase the likelihood of serious complications or death. This project is designed to identify the effects of these drugs on the organ systems of vulnerable populations. This information would inform the selection and application of effective drugs that also cause minimal negative consequences. This project will also advance the education and research experience of under-represented groups in the STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>This project combines ?horizontal? and ?vertical? analyses of global genomic datasets. The ?horizontal? perspective will map the landscape of gene expression under various conditions that will enable broader consideration of potential changes that drug treatments could have on Covid-19. The ?vertical? perspective will identify regulatory mechanisms that suggest possible treatments to target specific responses (e.g., increases in the different types and levels of cytokines or decreases in the ACE2 levels) for the different phenotypes. The integrative approach of this proposal will capitalize on the timely results from the latest studies and incorporate these results into the gene regulatory network analysis to provide phenotypic-specific guidance on potential anti-inflammatory treatments and insight into the host response as a function of the phenotype. The scientific and engineering contribution of this project is the development and application of an integrative, multi-scale, and multi-faceted approach that models cellular interactions (signaling and regulatory) to enable prediction of the phenotypic responses to external stimuli, including drugs and pathogens. This integrative modeling framework will be applicable to other pathogens and patient populations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

The MolSSI is jointly supported by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure and the Divisions of Chemistry and Materials Research. The centerpieces of this engagement will be (1) a centralized repository for simulation-related data targeting the virus and host proteins and potential pharmaceuticals, and (2) a select set of MolSSI Software Seed Fellowships for Ph.D. students and postdocs targeting COVID-19 related software tools that operate on the data developed in the repository. These two components will enable the biomolecular simulation community to share and utilize key data and other resources to help identify the structural and dynamic characteristics of the host-virus complex to generate potential leads for therapeutics. Although this project is intended to address the acute COVID-19 crisis, in the near term, it also will impact research communities and the next generation of computational molecular scientists in the confrontation and proactive resolution of future world problems.<br/><br/>The MolSSI will create and curate a large-scale repository containing: simulation input files (structures, configurations, scripts, Jupyter notebooks) in an organized structure; MD trajectories, analysis tools, and ready models for drug discovery; pointers to preprint servers such as arXiv, bioRxiv, and ChemRxiv on biomolecular simulation research in regards SARS-CoV-2; and DOI services that create citable data. In addition, it will engage the molecular sciences community through a set of Software Fellowships for graduate student and postdocs to carry out software development, such as large-scale MD simulations, design of drug discovery tools such as docking, machine learning for small molecule toxicity predictions, and methods for determining whether new drugs are bioavailable or can be synthesized. Collectively, these resources will speed the identification and development of leads for antiviral drugs, analyzing structural effects of genetic variation in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and inhibitors that can disrupt protein-protein interactions to viral entry into cells and adherence to surfaces that cause disease spread.<br/><br/>This award is being funded by the CARES Act supplemental funds allocated to CISE and MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

This project will develop new mobile sensing and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques for in-home evaluation of COVID-19 infection in order to pursue automated and non-invasive screening of potential viral disease carriers. It aims to timely identify negative cases caused by other diseases with similar symptoms, and hence avoids unnecessary hospital visits as many as possible. <br/><br/>The proposed techniques will use commodity smartphones to measure the changes of humans? airway mechanics, which are uniquely correlated to COVID-19 infection. These measurements build on acoustic sensing with smartphones? built-in speakers and microphones. First, new acoustic waveforms will be designed to minimize acoustic signal distortion in human airways. Second, new signal processing techniques will be developed for accurate measurements. Third, deep learning techniques will be used to develop generic models that depict the core characteristics of airway mechanics. These techniques will be evaluated by lab testing and experiments with student volunteers. This research will enable identifying false positives of COVID-19 infection out of the clinic and could contribute to the containment of the virus spread and damage. The proposed technologies will be applicable to a wide variety of commodity smartphones and could also be used in daily practice with handmade mouthpieces. Broader impacts will also result from a variety of education and outreach activities. New courses will be developed to incorporate the outcome of this research, and the research outcome will be disseminated through technology transfer to industry. The outcome of this project, including source codes and collected data from student volunteers, will be maintained at the project repository (http://www.pitt.edu/~weigao/research_COVID19.html) for at least five years, and will be made available to the public community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

RAPID Project is to develop a diagnostic platform that is well-suited for widespread monitoring of infection during pandemics, such as the current COVID-19 threat. It consists of a low-cost mailer that can be used at home, returned in the mail in a safely-sealed, confidential envelope and quickly scanned upon receipt without opening to diagnose infection. These results can be relayed to the user immediately and a real-time outbreak map along with affected demographics can be produced. This approach off-loads the burden of diagnostics from health workers, eliminates the increased use of limited personal protective equipment, and provides a better response to outbreaks. Resources could be more efficiently allocated by local and federal governments, and workers could make more informed decisions on staying at home or going to work. Moreover, this project will train a team of four students to collaborate quickly together to meet the design constraints of an actual product based on technologies from their thesis work. Commercial impact beyond COVID-19 would be a highly modular platform that can be rapidly adapted to other current diagnostic needs (HIV, tropical diseases) as well as future pandemics. <br/><br/>The proposed project overcomes the current methods of COVID-19 detection which are limited by 1) healthcare workers having to collect samples, 2) shipment of biological specimens, and 3) bottleneck of assessment with current RT-PCR techniques. What is needed is a more rapid method of widespread genetic testing for epidemic control that overcomes these limitations. Here we propose a new sensor system that relies on embedded contact-free sensors and sensitive RNA detection and amplification in a low-cost, passive (no onboard power) solution that allows for the user to collect sample and safely carry or mail to a local scanner. In this work we will design genetic switches sensitive to COVID-19 RNA (aim 1), implement these switches on paper substrates with cell free protein production (aim 2), and integrate them with a resonant sensor RF transducer (aim 3). The project deliverable will be a working prototype that is tested in our collaborative labs, along with a first generation data visualization interface.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1246	Abbas Ourmazd	University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee	None	2020-05-01	2022-04-30	EAGER: Functionally Relevant Structural Heterogeneity in Coronavirus SARS-CoV2 Proteins	Biological Sciences - In order to prevent infections by specific viruses, it is important to understand the molecular details that drive the virus into host cells where they replicate, making more viral particles that spread to other cells in the infected individual. This award will help understand the mechanisms of the SARS-CoV2 infectivity, the virus responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic, by employing machine learning algorithms to make movies of key proteins involved in driving its infection. There is mounting evidence that viral proteins exist in a range of structures, known as conformations, and that these can play a critical role in their function. In this project, recently developed machine-learning techniques will be used to determine the conformational landscape of key SARS-CoV2 proteins at near-atomic level, with and without antibody involvement. Atomistic insight into the conformational changes in SAR-CoV2 proteins is expected to help clarify the structural basis of virulence in this virus and its successors, ultimately providing a foundation for the development of suitable therapeutic strategies against coronaviruses. <br/><br/>Using experimental cryo-EM snapshots, this project will map the functionally relevant conformational heterogeneities of key SARS-CoV2 proteins to gain a deeper understanding of the role of conformational heterogeneity in this pandemic virus. The specific goals of this project are as follows: (1) Apply advanced machine-learning algorithms to experimental cryo-EM single-particle snapshots in order to determine the energy landscapes of key SARS-CoV2 proteins with and without antibody involvement; (2) Identify the functionally important conformational paths on the relevant energy landscapes; (3) Compare and contrast motions along functional paths with those inferred by discrete clustering methods; (4) Determine the biological implications of conformational motions associated with function; and (5) Make the results widely accessible in order to help facilitate the development of therapeutic strategies.<br/><br/>This RAPID award is made by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1247	Judith Klein	Colorado School of Mines	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	RAPID: Prediction of coronavirus infections and complications at the individual and the population levels from genomic, proteomic, clinical and behavioral data sources	Computer and Information Science and Engineering - As of mid-April 2020, two million people are infected worldwide with the novel coronavirus that first appeared in Wuhan, China in December of 2019. Now, the USA is at the epicenter of this pandemic, where it has already killed 20,000 people. Approaches to slow the progression are urgently needed. This requires a better fundamental understanding of the factors affecting not only virus spread, but also who develops complications and ultimately dies from the infection. It is becoming clear that many factors are at play, including molecular, physiological, lifestyle, behavioral, demographic and socio-economic ones. In particular, co-morbidities such as diabetes and high blood pressure are known risk factors for COVID-19 complications and death but are likely only the tip of the iceberg. Molecular data indicates that as many as 100 co-morbidities exist. Given this complexity, statistical approaches are needed to integrate and account for all of these factors when predicting and assessing the health risks arising from coronavirus spread and infection. This project will create computational tools that will help individuals and healthcare professionals make decisions related to coronavirus, helping target human and material resources where they are most needed. To decrease the numbers of people suffering from this pandemic, these tools are needed urgently.<br/><br/>Integrating large numbers of risk factors through machine-learning approaches allows the building of statistical models that take all evidence into account. COVID-19 infections will be predicted at the individual and population levels. At the individual level, two binary (yes/no) classifiers will be built, (1) if an individual is likely infected with coronavirus, and if yes, (2) will the patient develop complications. As with all predictions, they cannot replace real data, but they can help prioritize who gets tested, who gets quarantined, who gets more closely monitored for signs of complications, and who gets personalized recommendations. Existing approaches include symptom-tracker apps, such as the coronavirus self-checker apps offered by the CDC, many healthcare providers and local government authorities and the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) and Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), which determine the degree of illness of a patient. None of these approaches account for co-morbidities, and they lack the use of machine learning for data integration needed to predict individual outcomes. At the population level, possible routes of infection will be analyzed using graph analysis, through analysis of proximity, social interactions, and materials transport, taking the individual-level information into account where available. The project will be highly interdisciplinary, integrating biochemistry and computer science with ongoing input and feedback from healthcare professionals. This will ensure that the work will be relevant to the current crisis and easier to adopt by healthcare providers. Students and postdocs who participate in this research will be trained in interdisciplinary research and will be exposed directly to frontline workers in the pandemic. A publicly available, free app and a web interface will disseminate the predictions made in this project broadly in the hope it will find many users.<br/><br/>In summary, the goal of this research is to understand how SARS-CoV-2 virus and host genomes interact to determine the full spectrum of disease outcomes, with the goals of identifying the cellular basis for host range and pathology, predicting morbidit,; and developing effective medical interventions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1248	Keri Stephens	University of Texas at Austin	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	RAPID/Collaborative Research: Human-AI Teaming for Big Data Analytics to Enhance Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic	Engineering - Social media data can provide important clues and local knowledge that can help emergency managers and responders better comprehend and capture the evolving nature of many disasters. Yet humans alone cannot grasp the vast data generated by social media, so computers are used to assist. Very little is currently known about how to leverage the skills of humans and machines when they work together (human-machine teaming) to identify meaningful patterns in social media data. Therefore, the fundamental issues this Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project seeks to address are 1) understanding the process of real-time decisions that human digital volunteers make when they rapidly convert social media data into structured codes the machine (Artificial Intelligence algorithms) can understand, and 2) using this knowledge to improve human-machine teaming. This project advances the field by revealing the unique abilities that both humans and machines bring when working together to comprehend social media patterns during an evolving disaster. It supports education and diversity by providing research experiences to diverse students, as well as generating data useful for interdisciplinary courses teaching teamwork, social media analysis, and human-machine teaming. Finally, the findings can help emergency managers better train their volunteers who comb through social media using their understanding of the local knowledge and built environment to help machines see new patterns in data. Hence, this project supports NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance the nation's health, prosperity, and welfare by articulating the unique value that both humans and computers bring that can lead to better decisions during disasters. The goal of this research is to better understand the real-time decisions that human annotators make under different environmental constraints, and how those contribute to the learning of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. Under time constraints and information overload, human decision-making capabilities are limited; yet, humans still have a unique ability to understand the contextual references to the structures in the built environment that machines cannot recognize. For example, the meaning of the tweet, ?Memorial is overloaded,? -- which means the hospital, called Memorial, is out of beds for patients ?- can be lost on AI systems that lack the knowledge of the built environment. This example demonstrates the value that humans in the loop offer in a human-AI teaming context. <br/><br/>This research focuses on capturing the ephemeral data from a variety of social media sources and our two research thrusts include: 1) online observations of Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) volunteers and a manager (a collaborator on this project) using think-aloud and cognitive interviewing strategies to reveal the real-time mental models used to make coding decisions for annotation tasks; and 2) an empirical analysis of different sampling algorithms for active (machine) learning paradigms to develop a typology of machine errors under diverse contexts that affect the quality of human decision making for annotation. This research will generate design guidelines that bridge the gap between the mechanisms used for real-time data processing with AI models and the understanding of context contributed by a human user teaming with the AI models. Using theories of human decision-making combined with knowledge of how AI functions, this project provides a real-time, mid-disaster examination of 1) how humans understand, process, and interpret social media messages, and 2) how to refine AI algorithms to optimize active learning paradigm. This understanding will provide a theoretical framework enabling future research to develop protocols to optimize human-AI teaming by using concepts such as motivation and information theory. This work can help emergency managers conduct better training of their CERT volunteers and other annotators and provide clearer guidelines for how to communicate the unique value that humans bring to the annotation process for AI systems. Both our protocols and developed understanding of how humans interact with AI systems will be helpful for global health organizations, local and state-level disaster decision-makers, as well as provide direction for the vast CERT network in the United States.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1249	Karl Linden	University of Colorado at Boulder	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	RAPID: Investigating molecular-level responses of coronavirus under UVC irradiation	Engineering - Coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19), have caused several global pandemics of respiratory diseases over the last two decades. A primary exposure pathway for coronavirus infections is through skin contact with contaminated surfaces followed by touching of facial areas. Effective and safe methods for surface disinfection against coronaviruses is urgently needed. This is particularly true in healthcare settings where reusable personal protective equipment (PPE), medical instruments, and surfaces in operating rooms need repeated disinfection. Beyond clinical settings, high-touch areas such as public transportation and commercial shops have an urgent need to stay virus-free as intervention efforts to control the pandemic are eased. Current surface disinfection methods using chemicals like bleach and alcohol can result in material corrosion and chemical residuals. A potential solution for surface disinfection is the use of ultraviolet light (UV) devices. UV light has been proven to be effective against other viruses but must be optimized to treat SARS-CoV2 and other coronaviruses because of their unique molecular structure. The study aims to understand how UV light from different sources (including newly available UVLEDs) damage the nucleic acid and proteins in SARS-CoV2 coatings. The findings will provide guidance for UV device design and operation for disinfecting contaminated surfaces, which will help in the fight against the COVID-19 global pandemic and future coronavirus-caused respiratory outbreaks. <br/><br/>Ultraviolet light (UV) devices emitting UVC irradiation (200-280 nm) have proven to be effective for virus disinfection by damaging nucleic acids and proteins. UV exposure to non-enveloped viruses revealed that DNA/RNA damage is the primary cause for virus inactivation, with a peak efficacy around 265nm, whereas protein damage is important at wavelengths at the high (~280 nm) and low (<240 nm) ends of the UV spectrum. Coronavirus, which is an enveloped, non-segmented positive-sense RNA virus, may respond to UVC irradiation differently due to its unique molecular structure. The goal of this project is to investigate inactivation kinetics and RNA and structural protein damage of coronavirus under UVC irradiation across wavelengths from 220 to 280 nm. Murine coronavirus and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) will be used as a representative coronavirus and a surrogate of human coronavirus in this project. The UVC inactivation efficiencies and kinetics of coronavirus will be determined by exposing MHV contaminated surface samples and water samples under UVC irradiation in a bench-scale collimated beam apparatus with three different UV sources: a UVLED system (emitting at 255, 265, and/or 285 nm), a KrCl excimer lamp (222 nm), and a low pressure UV lamp (254 nm). The RNA damage of MHV under UVC irradiation across wavelengths will be investigated using long range reverse transcript quantitative polymerase chain reaction and the protein damage will be assessed using peptide liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The fundamental scientific relationship between virus molecular structure and UV inactivation efficiency and mechanisms will be evaluated by comparing the UV action of coronavirus to those of nonenveloped viruses used in previous studies. These findings will lead to generation of definitive UV-disinfection kinetics of coronavirus on surfaces to inform proper operation and use of UV devices and support the engineering of new disinfection devices that will serve as urgent and effective interventions during relevant public health emergencies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

The short-term reductions in most crimes are consistent with various opportunity-based theories of crime with fewer people on the streets and visiting places like bars. The reports of increased domestic violence align with opportunity-based theories and in addition strain-based theories. Over the longer term, however, the reported crime reduction trends may reverse themselves as people become more economically impacted. Impacts of restricted admissions and accelerated releases from local jails and prisons on crime and on infection rates, within these facilities during this pandemic, are also unknown and of policy interest.<br/><br/> Analyses will be conducted at the level of county and city for crime and jail population impacts and at the level of the state for prison population impacts. To estimate these effects we aim to do difference-in-difference type analyses. The main objectives of this project are to provide a rapid analysis of these impacts on crime and corrections populations to be completed prior to a possible future resurgence of the pandemic, and to share with policymakers rigorous analyses that will assist in informing their decisions in dealing with the crisis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1251	Peter Vikesland	Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	RAPID: Development and Testing of Low-Cost Sensor Platforms for SARS-CoV-2 in Aerosols	Engineering - The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted human health on a global scale, with over a quarter million fatalities to date. There is growing evidence that COVID-19 is transmitted by the presence of SARS-COV2 virus in small respiratory droplets known as aerosols. To slow transmission of COVID-19, we need a better understanding of how much virus travels through the air in these droplets. Current methods to measure the virus are too time consuming to provide information necessary to fully combat transmission through air. Using nanotechnology, the proposed research will develop a faster way to measure viruses in small droplets. This will allow us to measure the virus in more locations to track them as they move through indoor air. The project team leverages research expertise in nanotechnology, aerosol science, and viral detection. Successful completion of this project will lead to production of a more rapid COVID-19 analysis tool that does not require RNA extraction and can be used for rapid and inexpensive testing. Results will be used to evaluate the scientific validity of the ?six-foot rule? recommended for social distancing.<br/><br/><br/>There is a pressing need for rapid and sensitive environmental detection of the respiratory virus SARS-CoV2, the agent responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Most current approaches for SARS-CoV2 detection rely upon RT-qPCR for quantification of viral RNA. These techniques are both labor and cost intensive. The goal of this research is to develop a rapid SARS-CoV2 detection method to test the hypothesis that SARS-CoV2 is spread by aerosols. A second goal is to assess whether the recommended six-foot social distancing guideline is scientifically valid, as research supporting this recommendation is sparse. These goals will be achieved through the development of a low-cost sensor platform for the rapid detection of aerosolized SARS-CoV2 virus that uses surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to detect viruses in under an hour. The secondary objective of this study is to deploy the developed platform within the built environment to quantify SARS-CoV2 transport. The project team includes researchers with complimentary expertise in nanosensor development, bioaerosol characterization, and virus detection. In the development of the sensor platform we will examine virus recovery and detection using both plastic and fabric coupons as well as gold-nanocellulose and gold-adhesive tape SERS substrates. Transport of aerosolized SARS-CoV2 in the built environment will be assessed using Phi6 (a surrogate for SARS-Cov2) and heat-inactivated SARS-CoV2 nebulized to generate aerosols and droplets with sizes and velocities consistent with human breathing, talking, and coughing. The low-cost sensor platform will be deployed at various distances from an aerosolization source. Virus concentrations will be measured using the SERS assay and compared to results using RT-qPCR for validation. This effort will be the first to explicitly focus on development of low-cost SERS-based sensor platforms for detection of SARS-CoV2 within aerosols or droplets. Additional societal benefits will result from assessment of the validity of the ?six foot? social-distancing recommendation for SARS-CoV2.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1252	Julie Martin	Ohio State University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	Collaborative Research: RAPID: Approaches to Online Implementation and Social Support in Undergraduate Engineering Courses	Engineering - The pandemic of COVID-19 is disrupting undergraduate engineering education globally. Students have been asked to move out of their campus residences and back home to take courses online. While some students may quickly adjust and continue to do well in their courses, others may struggle to feel connected to campus and their courses. Recent research has found that peers are a major support for engineering students and supportive social relationships and networks are critical for navigating through engineering education and careers. This research will provide an understanding of how engineering instructors are supporting student connections in their courses and what other social supports students have during this time. <br/><br/>This research explores how choices made by engineering instructors during the COVID-19 pandemic are associated with undergraduate engineering students? academic social capital and achievement of learning outcomes. This work uses a multiple cross-case comparison of three undergraduate engineering courses taught in different ways. Data is collected from three team-based engineering courses at Purdue University: a large first-year course, a medium-sized senior-level capstone course, and a small service-learning course that has first year through senior-level students. Data collection consists of student surveys, interviews with students, faculty, and graduate teaching assistants, course documents such as syllabi and schedules, and student assignment scores. The findings from this study will make online and in-person instruction more inclusive and easier for instructors because it will help make future decisions to ensure that all students have the resources they need to be successful in the course and to persist in their major. Findings and recommendations will be shared with instructors of the courses studied, potentially influencing the learning experiences of more than 3,000 students each year. The research team will use the results of this research to create a list of best practices for online STEM instructors which will be disseminated to the public through social media, professional organization outlets, and archival journals. Ultimately, findings will inform STEM instructors about what they can do to support the success of all undergraduate students by helping them to build academic social capital, whether during online or in-person instruction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

By taking advantage of significant reductions in atmospheric emissions associated with current COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders, a natural experiment has presented itself that allows for observations to be made under uniquely useful conditions. Results will help constrain predictive models of pollutant concentrations and guide regulatory agencies in best strategies to mitigate poor air quality.<br/><br/>Gaseous and particulate samples will be collected during and after the lifting of COVID-19 by co-locating sampling devices on Caltech?s established roof-top sampling platform, where continuous monitoring of essential parameters, including NOx, O3, and PM2.5, is ongoing. Focus in this study is on the detailed chemical speciation of the important precursor group of compounds denoted as volatile to intermediate volatility organic compounds (I/VOCs) containing 1 to 15 carbon atoms (C1-C15). These compounds are emitted through a number of different sources, including from fossil fuel production and burning, use of chemical products, and biological productivity. Their ill-defined sources and reactivities have been attributed to an existing gap in knowledge that could describe higher-than-expected O3 levels in megacities where precursor emissions have seen a general decrease in past decades. Here, I/VOC sources and source markers will be determined during a period when transportation associated emissions to VOCs and NOx are low. State-of-the-art analyses of collected samples at PIs? laboratories include two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC) with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS) and a multi-column/detector GC system with 5 different types of separation and detection combinations. Results will (i) provide new insight into the intricate mechanisms of O3 and PM2.5 production under uniquely low NOx conditions and a changing mix of VOCs, and (ii) help constrain predictive models of atmospheric chemistry and air quality.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

As a result, many doctors and nurses are reusing personal protective equipment intended to be discarded after a single use and thereby increasing their risk of contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. These medical workers, and also the general public, urgently need reliable guidelines for sterilization of personal protective equipment to enable safe reuse. Dry heat sterilization can be performed almost anywhere (including home ovens and rice cookers), and viruses inside of crevices or within fabrics are easily inactivated; this project will provide evidence-based guidelines for the time required to achieve sterilization at a given temperature. The project will also enable prediction of the lifetime of human coronaviruses across various climates, which will be of extreme importance to epidemiologists in predicting the spread of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the severity of a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic that may accompany the return of colder weather this upcoming autumn and winter.<br/><br/>This collaborative research project will produce a thermodynamic model that combines a framework built on the Arrhenius equation and the rate law with both existing and forthcoming experimental data to accurately describe the thermal inactivation time of SARS-CoV-2. The proposed thermodynamic model will treat viruses as large molecules that undergo thermal denaturation and will be used to predict inactivation times for viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, by incorporating physical properties of each virus as inputs to determine the dependence of viral inactivation rate on temperature and other environmental conditions. The project will aim to achieve three objectives, namely: (1) to model the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 due to thermal degradation, including the effects of humidity, pH, surface material, and other conditions in addition to temperature; (2) to experimentally demonstrate sterilization due to thermal inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 on medical personal protective equipment and refine the thermodynamic model by incorporating data from these experimental results; and (3) to characterize thermal degradation of personal protective equipment during repeated thermal sterilization cycles. This work will lead to an unprecedented fundamental understanding of the thermal inactivation of viruses that will help fight the current COVID-19 pandemic and provide the basis for modeling viruses that cause future outbreaks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the recommendation to maintain social distancing, students will virtually contribute to computational research projects focused on COVID-19. The Northeastern University REU Site will recruit a total of six students, primarily from colleges with limited research opportunities or who are from an under-represented group, to be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted and many will present the results of their work at future scientific conferences. Assessment of the program will be done through the online SALG URSSA tool. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths. <br/><br/>The primary focus of this undergraduate research program will be for the students to learn about and use computational techniques that will be applied to urgent research questions surrounding the functions and control mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Each student will be trained in some of the following skills: molecular modeling, ligand docking, molecular dynamics simulations, biomolecular electrostatics, and quantum mechanical electronic structure calculations. Students will analyze SARS-CoV-2 proteins and screen libraries of small molecules that can bind to and control these proteins. They will be mentored by three faculty members and six graduate students from the departments of Chemistry and Chemical Biology and Bioengineering at Northeastern University. They will contribute critical new knowledge about how the viral proteins function and how their function may be modulated. The students will also receive professional development training in areas such as research ethics, scientific writing, the graduate school application process, and resume writing. Participants will be selected by the PIs, based on applications consisting of college transcripts, personal statements, and letters of reference. Preference will be given to students who were accepted by another REU program that was subsequently cancelled because of the pandemic. More information about the program is available by contacting PI Dr. Mary Jo Ondrechen (mjo@neu.edu) or co-PIs Dr. Steven Lopez (s.lopez@northeastern.edu) and Dr. Mona Minkara (m.minkara@northeastern.edu).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1256	Tamar Schlick	New York University	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	RAPID: Exploring Covid-19 RNA Viral Targets By Graph-Theory-Based Modeling	Mathematical and Physical Sciences - The urgently needed treatments and vaccines for COVID-19 rely on a fundamental understanding of the complex viral apparatus. This project will determine the structural properties and drug-binding potential of two regions of the viral RNA essential for invasion and propagation of the COVID-19 genome in host cells: genes responsible for making spike and fusion proteins. Specifically, the project will develop new and efficient graph-theory based computational algorithms for identifying subregions in the COVID-19 viral genome that alter the RNA substructure when they are mutated. Identification of these subregions will aid in the discovery of anti-viral inhibitor compounds. Graph theory tools already developed in the PI?s lab offer coarse-grained approaches for RNA structural analysis and design. The PI will combine these tools with biomolecular modeling to examine the therapeutic potential of anti-viral inhibitors known from SARS, MERS, and other viruses. This project will produce structural insights into the RNA viral regions and identify critical nucleotides and candidate inhibitors that will help make progress against COVID-19. The research has profound impact to COVID-19 as well as other coronaviruses that could emerge in the future. The project offers unique interdisciplinary training in mathematics, biology, chemistry, and scientific computing for young scientists, including women and minorities. The research results will be shared rapidly with the COVID-19 research community at large.<br/><br/>RNA-targeting approaches have therapeutic potential due to the high sequence and structure conservation of the viral genomes and the rapid emergence of CRISPR technology. They also present alternatives when protein-inhibiting compounds lead to invasion of the RNA viral genome itself. Such compounds that alter the RNA structure significantly are expected to inhibit viral invasion and replication. Because the fusion-protein coding region contains a pseudoknot (intertwined base-pair) substructure involved in a frame-shifting mechanism, the determination of critical mutation regions and associated compounds that destroy this pseudoknot will be invaluable. The project team has rich experience in biomolecular modeling and simulation of nucleic acid complexes and has developed a graph-theory framework for analyzing RNA motifs, predicting structures, and designing novel RNA folds. The graph-theory framework will be extended and applied in this project to address the COVID-19 pandemic by determining key regions in the RNA COVID-19 viral genome and associated chemical inhibitors that would interfere with viral fusion into and replication within host cells. With this award, the Mathematical Biology Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry are funding Dr. Schlick from New York University to determine the structural properties and drug-binding potential of the COVID-19 viral RNA.<br/><br/>This grant is being awarded using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1257	Sindy KY Tang	STANFORD UNIVERSITY	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	RAPID: Effective mass spray disinfection using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)	Engineering - The SARS-CoV-2 persists on contaminated objects or surfaces, referred to as fomites, for long times, which may promote virus spread. Effective and efficient disinfection of surfaces in public spaces will play an important role in plans to resume business, education, commerce, and other important activities. Mass spray disinfection is currently used in multiple countries by employing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). While this strategy has potential benefits, such as the minimization of health risk to personnel performing the disinfection and the potential for large-scale and quick deployments, the effectiveness of mass spray disinfection, especially for Covid-19, has not been systematically examined. The goal of this RAPID project is to identify effective mass spray disinfection strategies for Covid-19, and employ UAVs to implement those strategies. The results of this project will provide effective means to mitigate the spread of Covid-19, as well as other infectious diseases (e.g., influenza), by intercepting virus transmission via fomites. The approach has the potential to be adopted as a general and scalable strategy for sanitization in hospitals, schools, and other public facilities that are susceptible to virus exposure and contact with a large number of people. To ensure the broader impact and accessibility of the research, all results will be available in open-source archives, as well as on social media dedicated to this project (e.g., Facebook, Twitter). The unique collaboration among the researchers provides an excellent opportunity for training and workforce development at the interface of multiphase flow physics, UAV engineering, and infectious diseases.<br/><br/>Fomites are objects or surfaces that can become contaminated with a pathogen. Studies have cited fomites as significant vectors for virus transmission in a range of environments including hospitals, schools, and offices. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to contaminate a wide range of porous and nonporous fomites, and can persist on many surfaces for extended periods of time from a few hours to days. The long persistence time indicates the need for effective surface disinfections to intercept virus transmission and the spread of the disease. Mass spray disinfection from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has many advantages including the high-tempo coverage of large and difficult-to-reach areas, and the minimization of health risks to personnel performing the disinfection. Nevertheless, the basic science that underlies the effectiveness of such mass spray strategies has not been examined. Instead, most prior work on surface disinfection is highly empirical. This project will develop a physicochemical understanding behind the empirical results. The project aims to address these gaps, and will determine the spray parameters and the underlying physics for effective disinfection under different conditions, and devise perception and decision-making algorithms that allow a UAV equipped with programmable sprayers to implement the spray strategies identified.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1258	David Zilberman	University of California-Berkeley	None	2020-06-15	2021-05-31	Collaborative Research: RAPID: Compounding Human and Natural Disasters: Implication on agriculture sectors	Engineering - One of the key sectors being significantly affected by the COVID-19 disaster is the agriculture sector. The COVID-19 human disaster is further posing significant challenges to mitigating ongoing natural disasters (e.g., drought) in different parts of the world, including the USA. COVID-19 will have a significant impact on multiple agricultural sub-sectors as farm prices will be impacted, supply chains will likely slow down, farm workforce disruptions will occur, and the odds of farm bankruptcies will increase. The reduction of demand for crops and the reduction of supply of labor is likely to reduce revenue and increase costs. Drought conditions will further exacerbate the hardship of the broader agricultural sector as water availability declines due to drought and costs continue to rise.The resilience of agricultural systems in the face of natural hazards (e.g., drought, hot days) has improved over the decades but the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic presents a new and unexpected challenge to the farming community. The combination of drought and COVID-19 can lead to a compounding impact on farming sectors. Droughts reduce crop yield and create financial losses, and COVID-19 further compounds this challenge by impacting farm price, supply chains, health risk, and loss of farm work force. This project will study how the combination of ongoing drought and COVID-19 will affect the agricultural sectors that play an important role in the nation's food security. <br/><br/>The research team will investigate the consequences of compounding drought and COVID 19 on farmers' socio-economic indicators at the county scale, and what strategies can be implemented to minimize the impacts. This project will advance knowledge of the combined influence of human hazard and natural hazard on agricultural sub-sectors and provides an excellent opportunity to study the compounding effect of two different types of hazards in different parts of the USA. Research results will be used to develop strategies for improving awareness about this unique extreme compounding, allowing stakeholders to take precautionary measures for such events in the future. The research findings will be shared with key stakeholders (e.g., Department of Agriculture, agriculture extension specialists) and is targeted to benefit those most affected by this ongoing disaster in the USA and worldwide, assisting in the development of precautionary measures that can be taken in the near future.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (CBET) Division and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1260	Krystal Pollitt	YALE UNIVERSITY	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	RAPID: Personal SARS-CoV-2 Exposure Assessment using a PDMS Wristband	Mathematical and Physical Sciences - NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT<br/>People with COVID-19 can spread the disease through droplets expelled when coughing. There is also a possibility that infection of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 can be spread through smaller droplets, called aerosols, released by simply speaking or breathing. While larger droplets quickly fall to the ground, these smaller sized aerosols can stay in the air for longer and travel distances far greater than six feet. This is especially concerning because infected people with no or mild symptoms could unknowingly be contributing to the spread of COVID-19. Airborne SARS-CoV-2 aerosols have important implications for healthcare workers and people that work in proximity to the public, such as grocery clerks or transit workers. One way to test a person?s risk for infection is to determine the amount of virus in the air around them. This project will develop a low-cost wristband made from a soft silicone rubber that can be used to rapidly detect a person?s exposure to airborne SARS-CoV-2 aerosols. This wristband?s collection efficiency will be determined in our lab, and the ability to detect airborne viruses in a real-world setting will be tested with healthcare workers in a hospital COVID-19 patient ward. The simple design of the wristband could shape how COVID-19 infection is assessed. This research is critical, as cases in the US peak and we prepare for a possible second wave of infections as shelter in place orders are eased. Results from this project will be shared with hospital networks and more broadly with public health organizations. Wristbands will also be given to elementary school children during cold and flu season to test for SARS-CoV-2 and other airborne viruses as part of a learning module on the spread of respiratory viruses.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT<br/>This RAPID proposal concerns the urgent need for monitoring levels of airborne SARS-CoV-2-laden aerosol as a critical strategy for assessing an individual?s risk of infection and identifying hotspots of exposure. The PI's vision is to develop a wearable, low-cost, highly deployable sampling device called the Fresh Air wristband. The envisioned device would passively concentrate airborne constituents onto a polymeric membrane sorbent bar while being worn. The critical component is the composition of this membrane, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based material, which was chosen given its efficient sorption of non-polar compounds that potentially include lipid enveloped viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2. An important focus of this project is identification of the physical properties and specific configuration of PDMS-based materials appropriate for a passive sampler, useful for simple and rapid exposure assessment of airborne SARS-CoV-2-laden aerosols. The goal of this NSF RAPID project is to develop a wearable low-cost environmental sampling device for detecting personal SARS-CoV-2 exposure to inform individuals of their potential risk of COVID-19 infection by determining the sorption characteristics of PDMS. The urgent nature of this work stems from the need to limit exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in order to decrease the incidence of new cases, especially in health care and other high-risk workers. Specific research objectives include the following: (1) Determine the size-resolved efficiency of viral collection on the PDMS-based sampler, and (2) Demonstrate utility of the Fresh Air sampler to assess health care providers? exposure to airborne SARS-CoV-2. The major outcomes of this research project include an inexpensive exposure assessment tool and a rapid portable test protocol that individuals or groups can use to protect their health. Project results will be disseminated by sharing exposure data and sampler design with stakeholders at the Yale New Haven Hospital and more broadly to other hospital networks.

1262	Dominik Konkolewicz	Miami University	None	2020-06-01	2021-05-31	RAPID: Viral Particle Disrupting and Sequestering Polymer Materials applied to Coronaviruses	Mathematical and Physical Sciences - This is an NSF RAPID award in response to the 2020 CARES Act and is managed by the Polymers Program in the Division of Materials Research of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.<br/><br/><br/>PART 1: NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Since the first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appeared in late 2019, the disease has infected millions globally. The virus responsible for COVID-19 can stay active, capable of causing infections, on various surfaces for days, during which time indirect contact transmission could occur. Coronaviruses contain both a surface envelope of lipids and surface presented proteins which resemble spikes. Both of these features of the virus can be used to trap and destroy the viruses within synthetic materials. Synthetic polymer materials capable of inactivating and sequestering the virus causing COVID-19 will be developed in this project. These materials will form tough structures, with the materials containing synthetic and natural groups to both disrupt the lipid molecules on the surface of the virus and to bind and trap the coronavirus spike proteins. The polymers will form a tough network, ensuring the material performs for an extended period of time. This research involves design and synthesis of polymers as well as characterization and study of their mechanical properties and focuses on developing materials that could be adapted or coated onto existing high-touch surfaces. Additionally, the project will create publicly accessible virtual presentations and content on how polymer materials are critical for the health care industry and innovations in materials for biomedical applications. With the development of materials with excellent durability and robust ability to disrupt and trap the coronavirus, a reduction in COVID-19 infection by mitigating the indirect contact transmission mechanism is possible.<br/><br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exhibits active lifetimes of over 24 hours. This enables transmission to occur hours or days after a virus containing droplet is deposited from an infected individual. Materials that destroy the virus and sequester the virus to the surface could reduce the transmission rate of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This project will develop virus trapping and disrupting tough networks which could be used to coat commonly encountered surfaces. The polymer materials will disrupt the lipid envelope of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles and bind the spike on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 with high affinity. Both purely synthetic materials as well as hybrid peptide/synthetic materials approaches will be investigated. The polymers will include tough network forming functionalities as well as peptide or synthetic polymers for both lipid envelope disruption and spike protein binding. The scientific focus of the project is to determine how a polymer material's microstructure and functionality impacts its ability to: form tough and mechanically robust networks; disrupt viral lipid envelopes; and immobilize SARS-CoV-2 through the surface spike proteins. A library of polymer materials containing distinct crosslink densities and macromolecular architectures will be used to determine how polymer structure impacts a material's mechanical property, lipid particle rupturing capability, and ability to bind to SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. This will guide the design of materials for optimal mechanical performance and coronavirus disrupting capabilities, and will facilitate the design of surface coatings that can hinder indirect contact transmission with long lifetimes of the structures. To remotely engage with the public on the importance of polymer materials, a series of monthly YouTube videos will be developed to convey how polymer materials are critical to health and safety, highlighting developments in materials for healthcare and biomedical applications.<br/><br/>This grant is being awarded using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supplement allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1263	Michael Rosenfeld	STANFORD UNIVERSITY	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	RAPID: Online Social Networks, Relationships, and COVID-19	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - The unique situation of a majority of Americans called upon to shelter in place during the COVID-19 pandemic has created society-wide social distancing in the U.S. for the first time since the Spanish influenza pandemic of 1918. How will social distancing affect marriages and other romantic relationships? This project will analyze couple stability or instability under conditions of extraordinary stress. We know that the coronavirus pandemic will have serious and potentially devastating short term impacts on health, mortality, employment, and economic production. It is possible, however, that social life and social relations may prove more resilient during the crisis than people would ordinarily expect. An understanding of the resilience of social relationships under extraordinary stress will provide the public with more confidence that future crises can be overcome. As family and relationship satisfaction is a key contributor to general well-being and low mortality, this study seeks to understand the ability of Americans to survive the pandemic with their relationships intact, thus contributing to health and well-being of the U. S. population.<br/><br/>We know very little about the extent to which social relationships can endure during a crisis that entails sustained social distancing. This project will field two nationally representative follow-up surveys to approximately 1600 American adults. The first follow-up survey will take place during the COVID-19 shelter-in-place period. The second follow-up will be fielded once the shelter-in-place orders have been substantially lifted. Both surveys will longitudinally follow subjects and relationships first identified in the How Couples Meet and Stay Together (HCMST) 2017 survey. The resulting dataset will have measures of couple satisfaction, couple stability and breakup, couple co-residence, income, employment, online social network use, and relationship history for the same set of subjects from before, during, and after the COVID-19 lock down. The project will analyze transitions to breakup, transitions to cohabitation, and transitions to marriage using multivariable event history methods. The different state prevalence of COVID-19 cases and the variable state responses to the pandemic will represent an important natural experiment for the social effects of a lock down policy. Findings from the project will inform sociological theories of relationship transition involving marriage, cohabitation, and partnering, as well as relationship satisfaction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1264	Elena Zheleva	University of Illinois at Chicago	None	2020-05-15	2021-04-30	III: RAPID: Stay-at-home attitudes and their impact on the COVID-19 pandemic	Computer and Information Science and Engineering - The rapid spread of the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has paralyzed societies and strained health care systems, with a rising death toll and severe economic consequences. Stay-at-home orders around the globe have been embraced by some and protested by others. At the same time, little is known about the spectrum of attitudes towards these orders and people's justifications for following or resisting them. This research will develop algorithms for analyzing stay-at-home attitudes on social media, connecting these attitudes to pandemic impact through a novel visual representation that takes geographical location and socioeconomic context into account. This research will bring greater awareness to the public about the role of values that protect life in public discourse and their influence on citizens' appraisal of policies that affect their own well-being. Shared values, beliefs, and understandings build the social cohesion and cooperation needed to build greater economic prosperity. The results of this project will help policy makers craft more persuasive public health directives to enhance public health.<br/><br/>Framing--highlighting certain aspects of an issue or event--can have a significant impact on the formation of perspective. To address the complexity of modern information networks, this project will develop algorithms that automatically detect frames propagated through social media. It focuses on value frames because people use those values to justify a position and issues can be re-framed accordingly to appeal to and change the opinions of target audiences. Creating the first dataset of its kind, this project will collect and annotate tweets that include stay-at-home attitudes and core value frames. Current state-of-the-art approaches to detecting attitudes in tweets are limited to binary or ternary classification of either sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) or language type (abusive versus "normal"). By bringing together state-of-the-art deep learning models with models that have more explanatory power, this project will devise a novel methodology for identifying values frames in microblogs that takes advantage of semantic and discourse structure information. By enabling statistical computing and analysis over geospatial data, for which few techniques exist currently, this research will make it possible to analyze datasets at multiple levels of spatial aggregation and to compare temporal and spatial differences to enhance participation and promote positive public health outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1265	Robert Reiner	University of Washington	None	2020-06-01	2020-11-30	RAPID: Covid-19 Forecasting Models for Removal of Social Distancing Measures	Biological Sciences - Given the dynamic and uncertain nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, predictive models have been used to inform the implementation of harm-reducing social distancing policies in the United States and elsewhere. Relaxing social distancing measures too early or too broadly, particularly in states where there are still many positive cases, will facilitate community transmission with potential to return to exponential resurgence. This proposal will incorporate measures of population density and human mobility patterns into predictive models to project future COVID-19 cases and deaths within US states and the nation as a whole. As locations ease or end prior distancing policies, consideration of population density and careful tracking of human mobility and incorporation of these data into predictive models will provide data-driven evidence for how these actions could potentially affect COVID-19 trajectories. As a broader impact this project will develop, refine, and share COVID-19 modeling tools that will forecast disease trends for different scenarios of relaxed social distancing measures. Results will be made available through an interactive open-access online visualization tool. In addition to the potential to directly inform policy, the results of this project will benefit the modeling community at large by generating data products of utility to all COVID-19 modeling efforts, which will be made available on a website where results, data, models, and other resultant products are available for open access.<br/><br/>The new modelling tools and derived data products produced in this work will enhance forecasting and scenarios of COVID-19 infections and mortality in two formative ways. First, data on population density and human mobility will be used to examine (i) how voluntary and mandated social distancing measures affect population-level mobility, and (ii) the relationship of these measures with Covid-19 infection and mortality. Second, a modelling framework will be expanded to generate forecasts of disease reemergence based on different scenarios of relaxation of social distancing measures that are currently in place. This multi-stage hybrid modeling framework combines a statistical model on deaths with a new component quantifying rates at which individuals move from being susceptible to exposed, infected, and then recovered (known as SEIR models). This modeling platform will be flexible to allow regular data updates and to incorporate new types of data on the drivers of coronavirus as they become available.<br/><br/>This RAPID award is made by the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases Program in the Division of Environmental Biology, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1266	Russell Fazio	Ohio State University	None	2020-05-01	2021-04-30	RAPID: Who is (Not) Complying with the Social Distancing Directive and Why?	Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences - In the current COVID-19 pandemic, one approach to minimizing the spread of the virus focuses on people?s behavior ? social distancing. Since the start of the pandemic, government leaders and health experts have requested citizens to follow social distancing directives. Despite this repeated message and despite the fact that many people are taking the message seriously, many others are violating the new norms. That raises important questions: who is and who is not complying, and why? Understanding why people choose not to practice social distancing is crucial for designing effective public service campaigns. This research investigates who complies, what specific beliefs should be addressed, and what factors make public campaigns believable. The project seeks to identify the factors that lead to greater compliance for the greater good, and will inform future public service campaigns. <br/><br/>A series of studies examines how social distancing behaviors vary as a function of belief systems. An innovative measure of social distancing is developed ? one that is more behavioral in nature than the typical survey. The critical beliefs that are to be examined stem from a conceptual framework regarding a directive as involving three essential components. One is the source -- someone is requesting people to change their behavior. A second is the surrounding context -- the request is in response to some challenge. The third component is the target -- the persons to whom the request is addressed. Belief systems relevant to each of these three components are expected to influence the likelihood that people will comply with the request. As a result, an entire network of beliefs is expected to influence how people respond and why. Some individuals? belief systems will lead them to view the request favorably, thus promoting appropriate social distancing behaviors. Others will reach more negative conclusions and subsequently refuse to take directives seriously. Once the concerns about the pandemic have lessened, study participants will be re-contacted and asked to again respond to social distancing behavioral scenarios and to indicate if they had experienced virus symptoms in the interim. Those follow-up data will shed light on the relationship between individuals? social distancing behaviors and their subsequent likelihood of infection. The research aims to inform theory regarding social compliance processes, and will provide a stronger foundation for developing future public service campaigns.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

The proposed work seeks to integrate the output of a set of diverse, individually funded Internet and network measurement efforts into a single comprehensive report that describes how the Internet responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. This project will facilitate sharing of tools and other measurement know-how, set up one or more workshops to share methodologies and interim results, and develop a report that integrates output of the different measurement efforts, in coordination with the measurement PIs.<br/><br/>While the technical knowledge on the state of the Internet will be gathered by the individual projects, the technical merit of this complementary effort arises in the coordination and facilitation, which will benefit the individual projects, as well as in generating a comprehensive report. Furthermore, this work will contribute towards efficiency and better outcomes by cross-fertilizing ideas among them. This effort coordinates results from technical assessment done by individual network measurement projects and, as a result, will present a comprehensive understanding of the state of the Internet performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such a comprehensive report will give policy makers, consumer advocacy groups, and ordinary citizens the best view of how the components of cyberspace have functioned and evolved during this time to meet their needs, and for future planning. The results from this effort will be made available at http://living-online.csail.mit.edu.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

The research will increase understanding of how life situations in urban versus rural settings affect epidemic disease experiences and will provide knowledge of important community characteristics that put residents at greater risk during the current pandemic. The study will also shed light on which characteristics of a region have been stable over long periods of time and which are aspects of modern life and perhaps more malleable. The research is therefore time-sensitive because the investigators will expeditiously communicate project findings relevant to the current pandemic to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. In addition, this project will provide student training in data collection and first-hand experience in conducting research to help deal with an unforeseen and serious public health event. <br/><br/>A new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, to which humans possess little underlying immunity, has been spreading throughout the globe. In this pandemic setting, rural regions may face challenges that are not present in urban areas. As there is currently no vaccine, it is critical to devise effective strategies quickly, to protect rural regions from echo waves of the virus that may circulate over the next few years. The world experienced a similar situation in 1918-19 when a new, lethal strain of influenza began to infect humans. Although there are significant differences between these two pandemics, the viruses have similar modes of transmission and overall impacts on human communities. Understanding the experiences and responses of rural citizens to these two pandemics provides important insights that may lead to new public health strategies that are more tailored to the needs of rural residents during major disease outbreaks. The project involves in-depth comparative analysis of mortality and morbidity patterns during the 1918 influenza pandemic and the present COVID-19 pandemic in the state of Missouri. Analysis will focus on data aggregated at the county level and will determine county characteristics (e.g., population density, number of hospitals, household composition, proximity to large urban area, ethnic composition, mobility patterns) that are associated with death and/or illness rates during the two pandemics. Historical data from the Missouri 1918 influenza pandemic will be examined to identify control strategies used in different counties during the pandemic, determine their effectiveness, and assess whether they would be of use during the present pandemic. This in turn can aid in the development of potential strategies that public health authorities can add to the arsenal already being used in rural counties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Participating institutions include Alabama A&M University, Ana G. Mendez University at Gurabo, Florida A&M University, Hampton University, Howard University, Jackson State University, Morgan State University, Norfolk State University, North Carolina A&T State University, Prairie View A&M University, Southern University, Tennessee State University, Tuskegee University, University of Maryland Eastern Shore, University of Texas at El Paso, University of the District of Columbia, and Virginia State University. Member schools are among the top producers of African American and Hispanic engineering graduates. These schools have been working to build a support organization to enable the participating faculty, students and staff to engage fully in the national education and research enterprise through multi-institutional collaboration. The unprecedented stress as campus operations moved online due to the COVID-19 pandemic creates the need to capture the experiences of the member communities. Lessons will be learned and applied in the summer and fall as universities work to improve the learning experiences of their students and continue to respond to the extraordinary disruptions caused by the pandemic. In addition to enhancing distance education efforts, nearly every tool used and every idea applied will be a potential candidate to further build the support infrastructure, programs and processes that can make it possible for the nascent IEC to realize its vision of enabling its partners to act in concert as a virtual super department. <br/><br/>The current project builds on two successful IEC collaborations funded by the National Science Foundation: the Experimental Centric Pedagogy (ECP) project and the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)/Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) Mega Site. The ECP project prioritized hands-on experimentation in the circuits and/or electronics courses of thirteen collaborating institutions. With the transition to online learning, the treatment is now distance delivery and learning and the enabling technologies include tools for online meetings, forums, homework and quizzes and other distance delivery compatible tools. The data collection protocols and instruments developed for the ECP will be deployed to study and improve student learning under virtual conditions. The Mega Site serves as a national model for how to broaden participation in engineering by successfully implementing multi-institution undergraduate research programs, which others can adopt/adapt and build upon. Now in its second year, the Mega Site will be offered as a scaled back, online program in summer 2020 and faculty, teachers and students are well positioned to participate in data collection activities to better understand the impact on critical workforce development programs that take place outside of the classroom. <br/><br/>The great distance learning experiment is sweeping the nation?s colleges and universities. The Minority Serving Institutions who make up the Inclusive Engineering Consortium are uniquely positioned to rapidly capture the experiences of minority engineering students and their instructors. Leveraging the existing network of collaborators from seventeen universities significantly increases the potential to successfully develop and test a model for online learning environments in electrical and computer engineering courses that can be used in times of crisis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Survey designs using multiple choice responses are by far the most common -- "open ended" questions, where survey participants provide a longer-form written response, are used far less. This is true despite the fact that when you allow people to provide unconstrained spoken or text responses, it is possible to obtain richer, fine-grained information clarifying the other responses, as well as useful ?bottom up? information that the survey designers did not know to ask for. A key problem is that analyzing the unstructured language in open-ended responses is a labor-intensive process, creating obstacles to using them especially when speedy analysis is needed and resources are limited. Computational methods can help, but they often fail to provide coherent, interpretable categories, or they can fail to do a good job connecting the text in the survey with the closed-end responses. This project will develop new computational methods for fast and effective analysis of survey data that includes text responses, and it will apply these methods to support organizations doing high-impact survey work related to COVID-19 response. This will improve these organizations? ability to understand and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.<br/><br/>This project?s technical approach builds on recent techniques bringing together deep learning and Bayesian topic models. Several key technical innovations will be introduced that are specifically geared toward improving the quality of information available in surveys that include both closed- and open-ended responses. A common element in these approaches is the extension of methods commonly used in supervised learning settings, such as task-based fine-tuning of embeddings and knowledge distillation, to unsupervised topic modeling, with a specific focus on producing diverse, human-interpretable topic categories that are well aligned with discrete attributes such as demographic characteristics, closed-end responses, and experimental condition. Project activities include assisting in the analysis of organizations' survey data, conducting independent surveys aligned with their needs to obtain additional relevant data, and the public release of a clean, easy to use computational toolkit facilitating more widespread adoption of these new methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1282	Louis Flamand	Université Laval	None	None	None	Understanding the pathogenesis of COVID19	Pulmonary infections by viruses such virulent Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MeRS) CoV associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Clinically, infections by these viruses are associated with a pronounced lung inflammation, causing respiratory problems that often develop in secondary pneumonia. Inflammation is the result of immune activation in response to infection. When activation is too pronounced or sustained for extended periods of time, complications occur. Two main mediators of inflammation are known: Cytokines and lipid mediators of inflammation (LMI). In the current proposal we will study the inflammatory response during infection/exposure of lung and blood cells to the newly described COVID19 and compare this response to that of SARS-CoV-2 and MeRS-CoV to obtain correlates of pathogenicity between these viruses. We will use primary lung cells and white blood cells from donors to conduct our studies. The mediators of inflammation will be identified and quantitated using state of the art methodology available in our laboratories. More than 200 LMI and 150 cytokine/cytokine receptors will be examined. Upon completion of this proposal, a detailed analysis of the response of primary epithelial cells and leukocytes to COVID-19 will be obtained, enabling the rational design of therapeutic strategies to help combat COVID-19.

1283	Isaac Bogoch	University Health Network (Toronto)	None	None	None	Harnessing human mobility and surveillance data for disease forecasting to drive evidence-based public health policy during the COVID-19 epidemic	COVID-19 emerged from Wuhan, China in late December 2019 and is currently spreading to international destinations, globally. At the time of writing, cases have been confirmed in 24 countries worldwide. Of major concern are early indications of human-to- human transmission outside of China in those without a travel history to China. During the two months of this epidemic, public health policy has adapted rapidly to emerging information about disease location, disease burden, and clinical features of COVID- 19. Public health screening and interventions will need to continuously evolve over the course of this epidemic to keep up with new foci of infection and potential new regions of COVID-19 exportation. We aim to harness validated tools to predict where COVID- 19 will spread in real time by using a novel, AI-driven web-based surveillance tool coupled with real-time human mobility data. This surveillance system identifies regions with real or suspected cases of COVID-19. We simultaneously harness global commercial air transportation data and geo-referenced mobile device data to reflect human mobility, also in real time. We have successfully validated these tools for COVID-19 forecasting during the course of this epidemic and published our results in peer-reviewed literature. We will first use the AIbased surveillance system to identify regions with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases. We will then model the spread of infection from these locations by harnessing human mobility data to identify and forecast new regions (at the city, regional, and national level) for virus importation. We will work closely with our partners in the World Health Organization, the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to use this data to help drive evidence-based public health policy in real time, with a focus on global projection strategies, and strategies for low and middle income countries in Southeast Asia.

Although there have not yet been any deaths in Canada, public health agencies are on high alert, as there is a real possibility of a serious epidemic. The WHO has declared COVID- 19 a public health emergency of international concern. As of February 14th, five COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in British Columbia and based on travel patterns there is every reason to expect additional cases in BC. There are many unanswered questions regarding the virus, how it spreads and the disease that it causes. This information is needed for a data-driven response to this outbreak. We aim to use two types of next-generation data (next-gen genomics data and next-gen human data), along with a data integration tool called PLOVER 2.0, to answer these unknowns. The research team will 1)Carry out rapid genomic sequencing on patient samples to study the virus, how it spreads, how it evolves and predict which drugs will work 2)Develop knowledge of how the virus characteristics, along with a patient's previous health conditions, impact the severity of illness and how they recover from the illness 3)Develop a software tool (PLOVER 2.0) that will allow us to carry out this research and will also make the data viewable by key stakeholders such as Medical Health Officers. This work will not only generate critical knowledge about the SARS-CoV-2 virus but will also help develop a better understanding of health outcomes for infected patients. The knowledge generated and tools developed by this research can ensure an evidence-based and cohesive response to this public health emergency, here in Canada and internationally.

By performing rapid response research, we can better understand social and policy countermeasures to mitigate the threats communities face from this and future Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEIC). This project focuses on the research area of social and policy countermeasures. Specifically, cultural dimensions of the epidemic such as examining how individuals and communities understand and react to the disease along with tailoring a response to the unique circumstances of different populations will be the foci of this project. Our research team will: 1) examine how Chinese diaspora communities in large urban centres globally, namely in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA or Toronto herein), Canada and Nairobi, Kenya are understanding and reacting to the novel coronavirus by studying social impacts and coping strategies. 2) engage with vulnerable groups (children, women, elderly, etc.) within Chinese communities using participatory action research approaches to counter misinformation about COVID-19 and share emergency management and public health practices and resources relevant to the health crisis. 3) share findings with emergency management professionals in both countries and collaboratively develop a culturally-specific public education campaign to support efforts to destigmatize Chinese communities during the COVID-19 PHEIC in both Toronto and Nairobi. 4) use social media and knowledge sharing events to educate the broader community on the true impact of misinformation, disinformation, stigma and fear, with the hope that this will improve community cohesion during the outbreak phase, in recovery, and for future resilience.

The situation is getting worse and may last longer than anyone can expect. Despite of only eight confirmed cases, Canada is now shrouded in fear and worry in face of uncertainty. The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) has one of the largest Chinese communities in the world and thus bears the brunt of the fear, anxiety, and panic. This, coupled with English language obstacles, has enabled rumors and misinformation to explode on social media. It has been suggested that the Toronto Chinese community is the most vulnerable, yet least prepared population for the potential COVID- 19 outbreak. There is an urgent need to prepare and mobilize the GTA Chinese community to fight against the possible outbreak. In this context, the overarching goal of the proposed work is to assess the knowledge, develop effective epidemic control practice, and identify the psychological impacts of the disease. This will be achieved through coordinated efforts across communities, professionals, and local residents, to address three specific and inter-related objectives: 1) assessing GTA Chinese immigrants' knowledge, attitudes/beliefs, and protection practices toward COVID-19; 2) developing, evaluating, and optimizing a mutual- support quarantine network to contain COVID-19 from further spreading; and 3) assessing the psychological impacts and the associated predictors of the potential COVID-19 outbreak. The proposed project is culturally relevant, practical, and community- based. The research team is comprised of multidisciplinary researchers from the related fields of public health (epidemiology), psychology, sociology, and health policy. As part of the ongoing effort, the team has been closely working with the GTA Chinese community in various ways. This project will benefit not only the target population but also other communities in Canada.	Canadian Institutes of Health Research	Research Grant	500000.0 CAD

News about emerging pandemics often bring out fear and anxiety in the public. Recent public response to the new coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak reflected blame, fear, and racism against the Chinese communities. We have learned during the 2003 SARS crisis in Toronto that stigma could lead to crushing harm on the health, psychological, social, and economic well-being of the affected communities. In response to the potential negative impacts of COVID-19 on the Chinese communities, our team proposes a cutting-edge model - Pandemic Rapid-response Optimization To Enhance Community-Resilience and Health (PROTECH) that consists of three interrelated components: (1) an online resource hub that provides accurate and timely information on COVID-19, and practical ways to cope with fear and anxiety; (2) an online group training with live video meeting to reduce stigma/stress and promote resilience among affected groups (individuals tested positive; healthcare providers experiencing stress or burnout, community leaders); and (3) a framework that sustains the first two components and aligns people, processes, and resources together. Our team includes clinicians, researchers, and leaders from diverse public, arts, and business sectors. We will also reach out to key opinion leaders and community influencers to mobilize the Chinese and other affected communities. We will use focus groups, surveys, and note-taking on project activities to examine the effectiveness of PROTECH in reducing stress and stigma, and promoting collective resilience, or how to best support the affected groups to keep well despite the challenges. Finally, the PROTECH model can be adapted and used in different communities across Canada and other countries for future pandemic outbreaks.

The municipal government shut down the entire city since Jan 23, 2020, hoping to halt the COVID-19 outbreak. "[B]elieved to be without precedent" (New York Times), this largest quarantine in human history provides a natural case study to assess the impact of quarantine, as a public health response to COVID-19, on individuals and communities. We will conduct five waves of online survey, each four months apart, to follow a diverse sample of 8,000 adults who lived in Wuhan during the quarantine. The survey will evaluate respondents' mental health, challenges encountered, and community services received during and after the quarantine. We will use survey data to identify individual and community risk factors for mental health outcomes during and after the quarantine, thereby determining the course of post-quarantine recovery and pinpointing the populations that need public health services the most. We will also conduct in-depth interviews with 120 adults who lived in Wuhan during the quarantine to examine, in much greater detail, how people understood, reacted to, and coped with the quarantine, and what local barriers, challenges, and needs existed in combating the COVID-19 outbreak. Our interviews will target vulnerable groups who have special healthcare needs (pregnant women, people with chronic conditions, and the elderly living alone) and people who are primary caregivers (people who care for family members with COVID-19, healthcare workers, and parents of young children). Spanning the fields of public health, sociology, demography, and disaster studies, this research will illuminate the feasibility of quarantine as a public health response to COVID-19, inform community and mental health service planning for post-epidemic recovery, and ultimately help to mitigate potential negative impacts of quarantine and the COVID-19 outbreak on individuals and communities.

We propose to carry out a two-year global prospective study that will enroll and follow-up children with suspected COVID-19 from 50 participating emergency departments (ED) across 19 countries. Patient epidemiological and demographic information, clinical characteristics, and disease outcomes, will be collected at the time of ED admission, during the course of illness, and at three weeks and three months after enrollment, using WHO-compliant case report forms. Statistical analysis of the collected data will allow for the identification of risk factors associated with children having confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and/or severe COVID-19 outcomes. In order to enable rapid implementation, this study will be built as a parallel study that borrows the infrastructure from an ongoing study - the called Pediatric Emergency Research Network (PERN)-Pneumonia study, which has ethics approval, a centralized database, data sharing agreements, and established study teams that are actively enrolling children in 70 sites worldwide. Our multidisciplinary team of investigators includes pediatric infectious disease and emergency medicine clinicians, epidemiologists, statisticians, and public health leaders (from PHAC and the CDC), all with extensive experience pertaining directly to the research topic. As data will be shared in real-time with appropriate national and international authorities, this study will enable policymakers to make rapid evidence-based adaptations to case screening and management procedures that will then allow for the earlier identification of children at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes. Furthermore, the establishment of this global multi-site study will be the first trial of a rapid PERN response to a novel virus, which, applying lessons-learned, can be urgently reactivated for future public health emergencies.

The urgent situation is pressing the global community to respond rapidly together to develop a vaccine or small molecule drug to inhibit viral infection. We have recently established a powerful Deep-Learning accelerated Docking pipeline to virtually screen a commercial 1.3-billion-compound library in a matter of one week--compared to the three years with previous programs. We have applied this novel algorithm to identify 1000 quality "candidate" compounds to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CLpro) which is uniquely critical for the viral life cycle. We will screen these compounds with a high throughput screening biochemical assay and then evaluate these hits using a cell-based SARS-CoV-2 viral replication assay in a Canadian Containment Level 3 facilty at University of British Columbia. In addition we will use X-ray crystallography to refine the protease 3D crystal structure to accelerate the development of COVID-19 therapeutic drug development. Our research program will significantly contribute to global response to the COVID-19 outbreak by rapidly identifying small anti-viral drug molecules in an extremely condensed timeframe. Our expertise, facilities, and capabilities in cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence, inhibitor modeling, X-ray crystallography, coronavirus protease inhibition, human viral pathogen research, and anti-viral therapeutics are world class. Our first application this month of "Deep Docking" enabled the screening of 1.3B commercially available compounds against the essential SARS-CoV-2 protease, in 1 week compared to the 3 years of conventional docking.

The virus has infected over 64,000 people and caused 1380 deaths and the World Health Organization has declared it a public health emergency of international concern. Although drastic measures are being taken to contain SARS-CoV-2, there is an urgent need for new therapeutics to combat this virus and reduce its spread.

No established treatments exist, thus there is a need to identify antiviral targets. As evidenced of recurring SARS-CoV (2003) and MERS-CoV (2012) outbreaks, there is also a need for long-term preparations to counteract future emerging coronavirus outbreaks. Currently, the pathogenic mechanisms that lead to COVID-19 and related SARS/MERS-CoV diseases are not understood. In this study, we will identify the host proteins that are targeted by a viral protein called a protease using an unbiased proteomics approach. Identifying the protein targets of SARS/MERS-CoV proteases will reveal into the protein sequence that binds to the proteases. We will engineer and optimize decoy protein sequences that will effectively block SARS/MERS-CoV protease function and thus, inhibit SARS/MERS-CoV infection. Uncovering the proteins that are targeted by the SARS/MERS-CoV proteases will also provide a catalog of the host processes that these viruses affect, thus gaining insights into the pathogenic mechanisms that lead to COVID-19 disease.

After the genomic sequence was determined the causative pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, showed 99.98% identity among 9 patients, was 88% identical to two bat SARS-like CoV, ~79% identical to SARS-CoV, and ~50% identical to MERS-CoV (Tan 2020 Lancet). SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were responsible for severe human illness and mortality (~10% in 2002 and ~35% in 2013, respectively). Although understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 disease is ongoing, it is believed human-to-human transmission is possible and the disease fatality rate is ~2-3%. In early February 2020, WHO reported >31,000 confirmed human infections, >640 deaths, and declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, presumably due to the possibility of a pandemic. The coronavirus 2019 outbreak is the third coronavirus outbreak causing a severe human disease in the past ~20 years. Currently a coronavirus prophylaxis vaccine and therapeutic drugs are not available. In this application we describe the investigation of vaccine candidates. Our team has manufacturing experience expressing a subunit Hepatitis-C virus vaccine candidate and has developed methods for industry-scale vaccine purification using removable purification tags (Logan 2017 Journal of Virology).

There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19 infection. The spike protein (SP) of the virus is the key molecule for entry into a cell and is a main target of host protective immune responses. A receptor-binding domain (RBD) located in SP is essential for the infection of COVID-19. Previous studies have demonstrated that RBD of SARS-CoV consists of multiple neutralizing epitopes that induce highly potent neutralizing antibodies. The neutralizing antibody can bind to SARS-CoV and interferes with its ability to infect a cell. These findings suggest that RBD of COVID-19 is an ideal anti-COVID-19 vaccine candidate. Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells that play critical roles to efficiently present viral antigens to the T cells of the immune system. Therefore, targeting DCs is a promising strategy to improve vaccine effectiveness. Recently, we have developed a highly efficient DC-targeted vaccination technology, and in this study, we will use this vaccination technology to expose the RBD of COVID-19 to host immune system. We will also investigate the potential of this novel vaccine approach to elicit potent immune responses against COVID-19 and SARS-CoV infections in vivo. The success of this proposed study will lay the groundwork for the quick development and production of anti-COVID-19 vaccine candidates, and contribute to a rapid response towards controlling the COVID-19 pandemic in China and worldwide	Canadian Institutes of Health Research	Research Grant	597128.0 CAD

By early February there were over 40,000 confirmed cases in 25 countries, of which 2.5% have been fatal. The WHO declared the virus to be a public health emergency of international concern. COVID-19 is poised to become the next pandemic.

The proposed studies are the first of a planned series of studies with the end goal of developing a rapid assessment system (assessment battery and online delivery platform) that can be used to assess, for any pandemic or major epidemic, infection-related excessive anxiety and xenophobia, and risk factors for these problems. To achieve this end goal, we will conduct three studies with a specific focus on COVID-19 using community samples. The goal of Study 1 will be to develop and validate measures of COVID-19-related anxiety and xenophobia (C-ANX, and C-XEN). In Study 2, these scales will be used to identify the correlates of C-ANX and C-XEN, which can then be used to identify the downstream impacts of these psychological reactions. Based on the findings of Studies 1 and 2, we will develop and evaluate an online public health assessment and information platform (Study 3) designed to reduce the risk of adverse psychological reactions to infectious outbreak. This platform would then be expanded to (a) monitor the psychological impact (as a public health problem) of a pandemic/epidemic, (b) identify people in need of psychological services, and (c) implement interventions for reducing infection-related xenophobia and excessive anxiety.

This platform would then be expanded to (a) monitor the psychological impact (as a public health problem) of a pandemic/epidemic, (b) identify people in need of psychological services, and (c) implement interventions for reducing infection-related xenophobia and excessive anxiety.

1303	Syed H Ali	York University (Toronto, Ontario)	None	None	None	COVID-19's Informational Virus: Analyzing the Viral Character and Effects of Social Media Misinformation	Social media is playing a central yet neglected role in the creation and spread of misinformation about COVID-19 by confusing public understanding, fostering racism and xenophobia, and affecting the capacity of public health officials to communicate scientific facts about COVID-19 to the general public. Without an understanding of the role that contemporary social media plays in the outbreak response, the resultant response may be of limited effectiveness. Thus, this project is based on the following research questions: how is social media-based misinformation shaping both public health and lay responses to COVID-19, and what public health strategies and public policies can be adopted to combat such misinformation and its stigmatizing social impacts? To address these questions, we will develop and apply a cutting-edge mixed-methods approach that combines big data analysis from computational social science with small data analysis from cultural and interpretive sociology. In year one, we will scientifically track misinformation about COVID-19 on Western social media platforms - Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Reddit - as well as on Chinese social media platforms - WeChat, Weibo, Tencent, and Toutiao. This will be supplemented with interviews with public health officials. In the second year, our analysis will turn towards understanding the effects of social media misinformation about COVID-19, including: xenophobia, racism and stigmatization. We focus on the following lines of investigation: (i) Social Media, Misinformation and Risk Communication in Outbreak Response; (ii) Misinformation in a Post-Truth Environment: Implications for Outbreak Response; (iii) The Role of Misinformation in the Promotion of Stigmatization, Xenophobia and Racism During the Outbreak; (iv) The Relationship of Social Media and Political Culture in Outbreak Response: A Comparison of China and Canada.

1304	Christine Fahim	Unity Health Toronto	None	None	None	Combating misinformation, fear and stigma in response to the Covid-19 outbreak: An international collaboration between Canada and Singapore	On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a pneumonia-like illness (previously 'coronavirus' and now named Covid-19) a public health emergency of international concern. In past months, misinformation about the outbreak rapidly spread, sparking fear and stigmatization of Chinese, Asian and other communities in Canada and abroad. We will conduct this study in partnership with the Chinese Canadian National Council for Social Justice (CCNC-SJ) and the Chinese Canadian National Council Toronto Chapter (CCNCTO), which are advocacy organizations aiming to reduce stigma and racism facing the Chinese-Canadian community. We have also partnered with the Yee Hong Centre in Canada and researchers and government officials in Singapore to explore how cultural and political contexts impact misinformation, stigma and fear. We will conduct a social media analysis to understand Canadian and Singaporean local and federal governments' response to Covid-19 and the public's reaction to these messages. We will conduct multi-language key informant interviews with citizens, health care providers and government officials in Singapore and Canada to identify drivers of misinformation, fear and stigma, and will develop corresponding strategies and tools to mitigate these. We will test our tools with an international, diverse participant panel to ensure our findings are meaningful to a global audience.	Canadian Institutes of Health Research	Research Grant	499965.0 CAD
1305	Amir Sanati Nezhad	University of Calgary	None	None	None	Rapid, Ultrasensitive Clinical Detection of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (nCOVID-19) by Novel Microfluidic Electrochemical Nano-Biosensors	In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in the city of Wuhan, in China and has spread widely, including Canada. In a few weeks, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection has dramatically increased. Currently, 20-25% of confirmed cases have severe clinical presentations. With no vaccines nor specific treatments, early confirmation before progression to late stages would provide more time for effective supportive treatment. The traditional detection process requires that samples from sick individuals be transported to laboratories for manual processing. This is extremely inefficient and introduces a significant time-delay that has severe consequences for disease spread. Since January 2020, tests have become increasingly available for clinically suspected patients. However, despite the high sensitivity of these methods, they are not suitable for rapid and large-scale screening for multiple samples because of their long analysis time. Moreover, these methods need skilled personal to perform and not suitable for point-of-care testing. Most of these assays have not been yet adopted for COVID-19. The objective of this project is to develop a novel diagnostic tool for rapid detection of early-stage COVID-19. The device will have an impact to timely inform and refine strategies that stop the spread of the disease.	Canadian Institutes of Health Research	Research Grant	795560.0 CAD

In combination with the sequence of nsp12 from SARS-CoV-2, previous studies on closely related enzymes from other viruses provide insights into how nsp12 functions. Our analysis indicates how the specific structural features of nsp12 provide new opportunities for creating inhibitors with higher activity and specificity, and thus likely to act as more effective medications for treating COVID-19. Our models of the 3D structures of nsp12 bound to RNA and drugs like remdesivir indicate how existing inhibitor compounds developed to treat other viral diseases could be modified to work more effectively for treating COVID-19. We propose to synthesize a series of modified inhibitors tailored to fit the structure of nsp12 and then test the activity of these inhibitors on purified nsp12 using a previously published assay procedure. The ability of different inhibitors to disrupt the activity of nsp12 will be measured using this assay. The most effective inhibitors will be cocrystallized into a hybrid form of the norovirus polymerase to provide timely structural information about how inhibitors are likely to bind to nsp12. This structural information will help to further refine the design and improvement of the next generation of inhibitors. Promising inhibitors will be passed on to collaborators and the general community to evaluate their effectiveness in cell culture infection models and ultimately in human clinical trials. We expect to synthesize the first series of novel inhibitors within 4-6 months and to be able to evaluate their activity by the end of 2020. Additional structural characterization will take another 4-6 months. Based on this information, a second generation of inhibitors will be prepared and characterized by the end of the 2-year project.

The proposed research will analyze the stigma, fear, discrimination, and misinformation related to the spread of the novel coronavirus, now referred to by the scientific name, SARS-CoV-2. Our research team will approach the problem by using several strategies to gain information from members of the Chinese and East Asian communities in Canada which have been targets of much of the stigma, fear, discrimination and even, violence, targeted at them because they are perceived to be responsible for and spreading the SARS-CoV-2 virus. First, we will conduct interviews and focus groups with members of the Chinese and East Asian communities to document and understand their experiences related to the COVID-19 disease epidemic, the scientific name now designated to identify the disease related to the new novel coronavirus. Next, we will conduct a representative survey of all Canadians which will assess their knowledge levels about SARS-CoV-2 including the prevalence, lethality, modes of infection and perceived personal risk of acquiring the virus. We will collect detailed information about aspects of participants' identities such as their gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, social class, religion, age, and other factors to provide a context for understanding their responses. We will then work to propose a model of how these various factors fit together to assist public health officials and others to understand and respond to the COVID-19 disease epidemic. Finally, we will design a social media response employing "social influencers" to counteract the negative message received about the COVID-19 disease epidemic and communities associated with it, and construct a website based on the principles of motivational interviewing to decrease the prejudices and stereotypes of participants and increase their health-protective responses and feelings of resilience in response to the COVID-19 disease epidemic.

Human epithelial cells will be seeded in “ready to transfect” multiwell plates, designed and produced in the laboratory of HE. Those plates are containing dried siRNA/transfection reagent complexes. When the cells attach to the surface, reverse transfection enables siRNA mediated knockdown of a single gene, in high-throughput. Then, the cells will be infected with clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates collected by SC and cCytopathic effect and MTT assays performed. After inactivation by paraformaldehyde, these transportable plates will be sent to the lab of HE who will elaborately phenotype the cells using an established imaging pipeline. RK will compare the hits from the screen to time-lapse proteomics data of SARS-CoV-2 infected human epithelial host cells (data was derived from SC recently), omics data from other coronavirus infection studies, and gene associations to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. This will lead to a short list of host dependency factors for which drugs will be selected employing publicly available drug databases. Selected host factors and drugs will be validated in the lab of SC employing a broad selection of SARS-CoV-2 isolates. In addition, RK will infer a SARS-CoV-2 specific protein interaction network and identify clusters of host factors to get drug combinations, which will be experimentally validated by SC. We will yield an effective drug treatment for COVID-19 therapy and prevention.	Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung	Research Grant	240072.0 EUR

Randomized trials are urgently needed for high-risk patients especially prior to full blown ARDS and mechanical ventilation. This multicenter phase II trial will analyze the effects of CP in high-risk patients with COVID-19 infection. Patients at high risk for a poor outcome due to underlying disease (group 1, pre-existing or concurrent hematological malignancy and/or ongoing chemotherapy for cancer; group 2, chronic immunosuppression not meeting criteria group 1; group 3, age 50-75 years and lymphopenia <0>1µg/mL not meeting criteria groups 1 or 2; group 4, age = 75 years not meeting criteria for either 1, 2 or 3) are eligible for enrollment. Eligibility also requires PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and O2 saturation =93% while breathing ambient air. Patients are randomized to receive (experimental arm) or not receive (standard arm) convalescent plasma from two different donors (day1, day2). A cross-over from the standard arm into the experimental arm is possible after day 10 in case of not improving or worsening clinical condition. The primary endpoint is the time to clinical improvement defined as two points improvement on a seven-point ordinal scale of patient state of health or discharge alive from the hospital. Secondary outcomes are mortality, changes in clinical scores, inflammatory cytokine changes and viral load dynamics. This trial systematically assesses the therapeutic role of convalescent plasma for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection in a high-risk patient population.

The Department of Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) have provided supermarkets with a list of 1.5 million vulnerable people in England; this is being used to determine eligibility for grocery deliveries. However, there are press stories that families are struggling to put adequate food on the table. And in the devolved nations there are delays in supermarkets obtaining information on who the vulnerable are. Many households are under significant financial pressure, some low-income families have lost access to free school meals, and interrupted supply chains and hoarding by some consumers are leading to significant upward pressure on food prices. We will provide evidence on whether vulnerable people - e.g. the elderly, those on low incomes, and those with young children - are having difficulties accessing essentials and maintaining a healthy diet. We will use real-time longitudinal data on a large representative sample (over 30,000 households) to provide a systematic analysis of how different people's food spending is changing over the crisis relative to pre-crisis spending patterns. We will show how prices have changed and how the crisis is impacting the number of calories different people buy, how they obtain these calories (e.g. food out, takeaways or home cooked), the balance across different types of foods, and the overall quality of people's diets. Our analysis will provide timely, invaluable information to policymakers tasked with ensuring a food supply chain that functions for all.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	110294.0 GBP

We find large and significant differences in the impact of the economic disruption across workers of different income levels, ages, and those employed under different work arrangements. They seek funding for five follow-up waves of representative survey data to enable the impacts of the crisis on different workers to be tracked and to assess the effectiveness of different policies aimed to smooth the effect of containment measures on living standards. Using a specialised survey company, we will survey a representative sample of UK workers in mid-April, mid-May, mid-June, and two longer term follow-ups depending on the duration of containment measures.

1354	John Drury	University of Sussex	None	None	None	Facilitating the public response to COVID-19 by harnessing group processes	There is international recognition that effective response to Covid-19 is dependent upon the public acting collectively and for the common good. This is important in terms of adherence to preventative measures, which, especially for low-risk groups, is as much about protecting others as protecting oneself. It is important in terms of volunteering and mutual aid, which is critical in complementing the official response by supporting and sustaining people through the pandemic. It is also important in terms of maintaining social cohesion and avoiding social disorder. This multi-method project builds upon understandings of psychological group processes to address how to develop and sustain shared identity and social solidarity during pandemics. It is organised around three interrelated strands that together address the issues of adherence, mutual aid and social order. The first strand uses experiments to examine the impact of collective identification on adherence, the role of leadership in developing collective identification, and how coverage of others’ positive or negative behaviours (e.g., volunteering vs. stockpiling) impacts collective identity and adherence to preventative measures. The second strand uses interview and survey methods to understand why people join emergent mutual aid groups, the effects of participation upon efficacy and well-being, and how such groups can be sustained over time. The third strand uses ethnographic interviews to examine the UK’s security and civil contingency response to the pandemic and enforcement data to understand how responder actions impact upon community relations, adherence and social tensions.

Government has provided them with billions of additional funding, but more may be required. A key challenge is ensuring this is allocated appropriately. Without such targeting, either more than is needed across the sector has to be provided or the most exposed and least resilient councils could run out of money or be unable to maintain services. Councils also need to understand how their residents are being differentially affected by the crisis. To help address these issues, we will analyse: 1. A suite of ex-ante indicators of the population and financial risks facing different English councils and their potential financial resilience, and publish the compiled data: 2. Actual changes in residents’ incomes and spending, council tax payments and problems, and benefit claims by local area across the UK, which will provide evidence on how key risks are crystallising; 3. How different English councils’ spending and revenues are changing during the course of the crisis, and the extent to which this corresponds to the aforementioned ex-ante and real-time indicators; We are having frequent discussions with central and local government, and the new research proposed here would directly feed into this – and inform wider public and political debate –, allowing us to help policymakers ensure councils have the funding and flexibility so that vital services can continue to operate and meet new demands	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	70812.0 GBP

In contrast to elsewhere, the UK has seen significant growth in self-employment, now reaching 15% of the workforce. They are predominant in those sectors most hit by shutdown and social distancing measures. This disproportionate impact on self-employment is likely to have a longer-term effect on entrepreneurial activity and regional economic performance in the UK if current policies are not able to support groups and areas that are particularly hit. Self-employment has specific social and spatial features which means that the crisis will impact on specific social groups and areas in the UK differently. Women and some ethnic groups cluster in the most affected sectors, and some regions, particularly in the North and Scotland, have large shares of self-employment in accommodation and food services. Although generous to those eligible, government support (SEISS) excludes some significant groups. We will investigate the disparate spatial and social impacts of COVID-19 on the self-employed. We will undertake 1) quantitative secondary analysis of major UK datasets in order to provide a robust understanding of differential impacts on self-employment. This will be complemented by 2a) qualitative research involving an expert panel, to provide contextualisation and aid rapid impact such as policy and practice advice, and 2b) interviews with the self-employed to understand personal perspectives and effectiveness of policy. We will provide evidence and understanding to inform future support policies, for example within local industrial strategies, to ensure rapid and sustainable recovery in this group of workers.

Protein reagents are provided free of charge by a consortium of leading protein production laboratories, in an Open Science initiative led by Wellcome and UKRI.In response to the urgent need for COVID-19 therapeutics, vaccines and diagnostics, many expert UK scientists are working to understand the fundamental biology of SARS-CoV-2. Reliable robust protein reagents are crucial to such research, but can be challenging and time consuming to produce, especially under restricted working conditions.To facilitate vital research on SARS-CoV-2, Wellcome and UKRI have brought together a consortium of leading centres of protein engineering and production to launch the COVID-19 Protein Portal. The COVID-19 Protein Production Consortium (CPPC) is made up of expert scientists from founding institutes including Diamond Light Source, the Rosalind Franklin Institute, the Francis Crick Institute, the MRC Protein Phosphorylation and Ubiquitylation Unit (MRC-PPU) and MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (MRC-LMB), the Edinburgh Protein Production Facility, STRUBI and the Structural Genomics Consortium; with logistical support from Instruct-ERIC.The CPPC will produce and provide access to protein reagents through the COVID-19 Protein Portal website at [http://COVID19proteinportal.org]. The Portal contains a searchable database of reagents, including viral proteins, human proteins and antibodies relevant for SARS-CoV-2 biology. Each reagent is annotated with key information, including sequence, origin, and SDS-page results post purification. Researchers are able to select the proteins they require from the database and submit their request with a short research proposal. All requests will be subject to rapid peer review, to enable the CPPC to coordinate and prioritise reagent allocation based on scientific merit and the urgency of the request. Once approved, a request will be allocated to one of the CPPC’s expert protein production laboratories, all of whom are committed to providing high-quality reagents as quickly as possible.In the spirit of Open Science, recipient labs will be required to provide feedback to the CPPC on their experiments, and to share important outcomes with the scientific community. By contributing to the coordination of research efforts across the UK, the COVID-19 Protein Portal will accelerate vital research to deliver effective clinical management of COVID-19.

1373	EYN LIMITED	EYN LIMITED	None	None	None	Novel Immunity Passports for Covid-19	Governments around the globe are currently using/trialing proximity tracking apps to trace people infected with Covid-19 . Apple and Google collaboratively developed tracing techniques that shall be soon available and is expected to cover 99% of smartphone users. Due to the sensitive nature of tracing apps, preserving a user's privacy is essential. As a consequence, the PEPP-PT project (a partnership of 130 scientists, technologists, and experts of institutions and companies across eight EU countries) is developing techniques to ensure an individual's privacy. While tracing is an important step (to detect and inform) members of the public of the virus spread (and if they should self-isolate), another, equally important step is the possibility of proving one's immunity status -- via vaccination or antibody test -- once they have surpassed the disease. To ensure the safe return of anyone infected with Covid-19 into public spaces (and/or crowded spaces such as public transport, schools, workplaces, airports), it is therefore of utmost importance to securely, accurately and in a privacy-preserving manner to allow someone to prove their immunity status. A generic way of achieving such a purpose is to link one's identity via existing identity documents (eg. passports, residence permits, driving licenses) to their immunity status (issued by a certified provider such as the NHS). Such 'immunity certificates' must ascertain the identity of its holder and their immunity status. 'Immunity certificates' are already in wide discussion within the UK government (and, other governments around the globe, as well as other providers). A much simpler (and, more accurate and privacy preserving way) is to use face biometrics instead of linking to identity documents (e.g. passport, driving license) or patient records. We simply aim to link face-biometry with immunity status. Such a system resolves four core issues:  [a ] fraud (ie. nobody can steal your face and your face is not a secret);  [b ] asserts the identity of an individual (ie. removes the intermediary step of an id document);  [c ] available offline (ie. does not need to be connected to the Internet); and  [d ] preserve's one's privacy (ie. storage of encrypted face biometry without linkage to other personally identifiable information). In the UK alone, it is estimated that over 1.5 million vulnerable people will be the worst affected by this crisis (with recent news suggesting lockdown procedures until 2022). In order to protect them and other members of the public, let's take a step towards proving immunity.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	46798.0 GBP

Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020, clinicians, researchers and scientists have been rushing to understand this new disease. Numerous academic publications and guidelines are being published every day and it is difficult for clinicians to keep up with all the new research and guidelines on how to best care for COVID-19 patients and themselves. These resources are released by different publishers, government bodies or medical specialty societies. Clinicians need a single point of access to this information and a much easier and faster way to search through these resources. Our AI platform will ingest peer-reviewed biomedical journal articles and national guidelines and then quickly retrieve the relevant knowledge to answer clinicians' questions. This can help save clinicians' time in keeping up to date with the latest research and guidance and improve the adoption of best practices so clinicians can protect themselves and provide the best care for COVID-19 patients.

This machinery can be run to produce PH neutral electrolysed water containing 0.03% hypochlorous acid, <0.02% sodium chloride & sodium hydroxide, and 99.95% water. This water has an ORP of around +900mv and kills 99.95% of all bacteria and viruses on contact, acting around 30 times faster than bleach. It is safe to use, is harmless to humans and the environment and requires no rinsing or washing off. It is currently being used in Italy for sanitising people in queues before allowing them to enter supermarkets. It is also certified for drinking water treatment in Norway. The Electrox water can be applied using ulv fogging equipment (provided by us) and in the case of ambulances could be operated at hospitals by hospital staff, rather than at remote decontamination stations. This would dramatically reduce the time taken to get ambulances serviceable after use with Covid-19 patients, and would relieve pressure on staff and ambulance fleets. Sterilising hospital wards, offices etc can be carried out in the same way using similar equipment and taking only minutes. Rooms can be re-occupied immediately after sanitisation. We currently have limited supplies of Electrox water at our premises in Wiltshire and are preparing a production facility for the arrival of the machinery, which has the capacity to produce more than enough Electrox to keep all ambulance fleets in the UK fully sanitised. Our mission is to be fully operational as soon as possible, in time to help with the current Covid-19 situation. With funding, this could potentially be achieved within a few weeks.

1378	SURGEASE innovationS LIMITED	SURGEASE innovationS LIMITED	None	None	None	Remote community-based digital rectoscopy for patients with rectal disease during Covid-19 Pandemic	The COVID-19 pandemic has exerted significant pressure on all elective and emergency NHS resources and capacity. This has been so significant that operations and treatments for planned care have been cancelled and it is now likely that many millions of patients will come to harm as a direct result of delayed diagnoses. New technologies may present a range of flexible and adaptable solutions that can also help widen accessibility to care and alleviate physician burden during and after the pandemic. Indeed, the need for rapid innovation and new ways of increasing capacity within the NHS have been identified as key to tackling the COVID-19 challenge. Each year the NHS sees nearly 6.7 million patients with gastrointestinal complaints as outpatients, and it performed over 900,000 telescopic procedures of the gut. Nearly all of this activity has stopped during the pandemic. Endoscopy in particular is thought to pose a risk of covid-19 transmission to doctors and nurses. This means that during the pandemic many patients with chronic conditions are not able to receive care and rates of new cancer diagnoses are falling. This will cause a large and second "peak" of deaths from covid 19 . This project will deploy a new, state of the art tele-endoscopy platform into the primary care setting so that patients are able to undergo endoscopic procedures during the pandemic and access specialist opinions. This will also serve to reduce the demand for formal endoscopy in hospitals after the pandemic. We will target two types of patients: 1) Patients with rectal bleeding or symptoms of bowel cancer presenting to primary care. 2) Patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The goal is to commence treatment in the community and protect patients from exposure to Covid-19 by keeping them out of hospital. This highly innovative project will establish and pilot a novel primary care service that uses this platform at the point of care supported by specialist "virtual" clinics in secondary care hospitals. This pilot will be run in two sites in London. Primary end-points will be completion of 100 appointments using the platform and digital endoscope. Secondary end-points will be patient and user satisfaction, safety, utility and identify barriers to support the scaling up of the technology throughout the UK.

1379	INVENTIA UK LIMITED	INVENTIA UK LIMITED	None	None	None	Encrypted Mobility Intelligence & Proximity Tracing (E-MIPT)	E-MIPT project is about creating a prototype digital tool for the government and the public aimed at controlling and stopping the spread of infectious diseases that leads to a global pandemic like the COVID-19 . By installing SIM card applications to collecting, aggregating and analysing radio measurements (radio fingerprints) taken by cellular devices on a regular basis, the system will be able to trace the proximity between mobile devices at all times. By combining this information and live feed from hospitals about newly infection cases, potentially infected people can be informed so they can self isolate or take necessary actions, and hence interrupting the transmission of the infection to more chains. This also means the government authorities will be able to predict the actual current and future virus cases and allow them to make informed and strategic decisions to combat its spread. To achieve this, the system will intelligently scan through the historical cellular radio fingerprints of the newly infected person for the last 2 weeks, for example, and identify the devices that produced a similar radio fingerprint at the same 10 minutes time window (which implies that a close contact had occurred at the same time and location). The process will be recursively repeated for all the chains of possibly infected people so ultimately the whole chain of infections will be identified. Additionally, the radio fingerprints are converted into anonymous locations on a 250 m2 grid of a map. Furthermore, the mobility state (e.g., idle at a home location, inside their 250 m2 zone or moved outside the zone) can be predicted from the radio fingerprints with total anonymity. This will help the government authorities to identify mobility rates in the country and support the lockdown of specific zones instead of the whole country, and finally inform people about the risk involved with entering a specific zone. **E-MIPT uses sophisticated algorithms and encrypted mechanisms for mobility intelligence and proximity tracing without compromising the privacy of individuals. This is because the identity of the mobile device is never exposed to the system. Instead, a digital key, that only the mobile device knows it belongs to it, will accompany the data. Additionally,** the system as a whole will include an opt-in opt-out mechanism. A web portal will be provided to the public so they can enter their digital key and the system will tell them if they are at risk of infection.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	49980.0 GBP

1381	SPECTRUM LOGIC LIMITED	SPECTRUM LOGIC LIMITED	None	None	None	Low Cost, High Throughput Western Blot Antibody Detection Device for Those Already Infected with COVID-19	There is an unmet need for COVID-19 antibody testing for those already infected with SARS-CoV-2 . This can be accomplished using serological Western Blot assays in a lab setting by detecting antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in blood samples. The antibodies bind to antigen proteins and are visualisation using bioluminescent particles. This test can show whether your immune system has fought-off SARS-CoV-2, even months previously. Western Blot assays have been used for many years to test for Hepatitis B and other viral diseases. Unlike home test kits, they offer excellent sensitivity and specificity (no false positives) approaching 99.99%. The test can be multiplexed with multiple samples run in parallel. The imaging takes approximately 20 minutes to run plus some preparation time. The test uses different reagents from the rtPCR testing widely used today for antigen testing, which are in short supply. The test will help scientists fight the pandemic by giving researchers a more accurate measure of how many people have had the COVID-19 . On a personal level, many people wish to know whether that have already suffered from COVID-19 and posses protective IgG antibodies. Existing Western Blot instruments are expensive and have poor sensitivity, because they use either scanning line sensors or lens-coupled CCDs. Our instrument will enable accurate laboratory antibody testing to be ramped up inexpensively. Our project will use unique, large-area CMOS image sensors coupled to fibre optic faceplates already used in surgical X-ray systems for 1:1 imaging without a lens or scanning. This allows our bench-top instrument to capture much more of the light measured in the assay, making it more sensitive. Because the sensors are already in mass production, the new instrument will be far cheaper than existing instruments (about 15% of the cost). Sensors can be rapidly mass produced using the existing supply chain. This will be the first product of its type using 1:1 imaging with a large-area image sensor.

1382	INGENZA LIMITED	INGENZA LIMITED	None	None	None	Recombinant yeast production of COVID-19 antigen to support clinical testing	This project aims to support a novel and vital alternative strategy to realise broad population immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus (the cause of COVID-19 disease) in the event that the adenoviral-based vaccines currently under development in the UK prove insufficiently efficacious, safe and/or cost-effective. It will show that yeast-based production of a key viral protein fragment (antigen), that has proven immunogenic in feasibility studies when linked to a novel Virus Like Particle (VLP), provides a rapidly scalable, highly cost-effective and versatile means to enable widespread vaccination of the UK and global population. Crucially, whereas the VLP can be readily produced in the bacterium _E. coli,_ the viral protein fragment is unsuited to production in bacteria and has only been prepared in cultured human cells, a method that cannot be cost-effectively scaled-up for clinical trials and full scale manufacture. However, the yeast _Pichia pastoris_ can produce complex mammalian proteins efficiently, enabling rapid scale-up and highly cost effective production. Ingenza recently engineered _Pichia_ to prepare novel antibacterial proteins to high purity by optimising their production, purification, testing and yield from _Pichia_, using an innovative manufacturing platform called "visABLE" which enables selection of the most productive and stable _Pichia_ recombinants and recovery of their heterologous target protein. In this project we will repurpose visABLE to deliver a recombinant _Pichia_ strain to rapidly prepare and supply the viral antigen, that will be combined with the novel VLP developed by researchers at Oxford University for efficacy testing. If comparably immunogenic, the _Pichia_ production system will permit rapidly scalable, highly cost-effective and cGMP-compliant manufacture of this vaccine component, thereby accelerating the development, testing and availability of a vital alternative to current COVID-19 vaccine production systems in development as well as providing a versatile and novel platform to enhance future UK viral responsiveness.

1383	AQDOT LIMITED	AQDOT LIMITED	None	None	None	Enabling Safe Air Quality Levels In The Transport Industry With Game-Changing Air Filtration	The transport industry has been significantly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. People fear that virus-containing bioaerosols cause infection on board which has contributed to the spread of the pandemic. This is also compounded by reports of air-quality issues arising from the often-unpleasant odorous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and airborne particles. This problem is global, affecting all types of transport including airplanes, trains, buses, cars and even passenger ships. Air quality could be greatly improved by introducing filters that not only kill viruses but also capture VOCs and odours, thereby reducing risks of infection and health concerns while boosting the confidence of passengers and crew in post-pandemic travel. Unfortunately, existing air-filtration technologies are unable to deliver the performance required even when used in combination (i.e. HEPA with charcoal filters). Therefore, alternative and novel solutions are required. Aqdot (a Cambridge-based SME) has a unique, proprietary VOC/malodour-capture technology (AqFresh) that is effective against a wide range of molecules that are unpleasant and/or harmful. The innovation is currently commercially available in home care, pet care and industrial cleaning products. This project aims to adapt the technology to meet the needs of the transport industry by developing scalable, ready-to-adopt air filters that bring together novel VOC/odour capture technology with antiviral capabilities, significantly improving air safety and quality in transport. The innovative filters, generated by impregnating appropriate polyurethane foam substrates with a unique coating formulation, will be designed to fit into existing systems of global filter manufacturers. The filters will be formulated and tested for anti-viral and VOC-reduction capabilities. These filter prototypes will then be incorporated and tested in operational environments by commercial manufacturers with a view for global roll out. Aqdot will partner with customers to allow rapid adoption of this innovation in their filtration frameworks in aerospace, automotive and public transport. Upon success, Aqdot's innovative air filters will bring major improvements in air quality for the transport industry worldwide to be free from viruses, VOCs and odours, minimising the risk of infections and health concerns onboard, helping to combat the immediate Covid-19 pandemic while reducing the impact of future potential pandemics. It will also assure safety and build confidence among passengers and crew to resume travelling following the pandemic, reinvigorating the transport industry and giving a much-needed boost to the economy. The project will demonstrate support for innovative UK-based SMEs, strengthen the UK technology portfolio and has significant export potential.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	50000.0 GBP

None	None	None	Application of proprietary AI computer vision software to enable remote, digitised management of patient recovery from orthopaedic surgery	This project is designed to model and develop a digital application to facilitate the use of Instructor Guru Ltd's proprietary software for management of orthopaedic recovery remotely, and more cost-efficiently, whilst improving patient care. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in postponement of many orthopaedic surgeries, which has created a backlog. Working with the Life Sciences Hub Wales, Instructor Guru Ltd. is capable of developing a service which can aid healthcare providers in tackling this backlog by reducing the number of physical follow-ups needed, replacing them with a superior digital service. This project will make it possible for Instructor Guru Ltd. to develop a prototype and work with surgeons and healthcare providers such as NHS Local Health Boards to deliver early trials and gain clinical validation.

1385	ISABEL HEALTHCARE LIMITED	ISABEL HEALTHCARE LIMITED	None	None	None	Isabel EPIFFANY medical eLearning platform	The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and enforced social distancing in the UK has substantially cut the amount of training time in the workplace for healthcare professionals in training. Without enough training, new doctors and nurses risk entering work unprepared and lacking core skills. Whilst our project addresses this problem now, our vision also provides a new solution for rapidly upskilling away from the workplace. Our solution is to create a virtual patient platform with cases - made by combining data from three different sources: 1) the very symptoms and signs reported by real patients themselves; 2) artificial intelligence in the form of a clinical decision-support technology and 3) the expertise of clinicians. The result is a new way of delivering online learning at scale allowing healthcare professionals in training exposure to a far greater number of clinical case problems available in any one workplace setting. The advantage of online eLearning is that platforms can automate the creation of thousands of virtual patients, as well as automate the assessment of performance of healthcare professionals on those cases as well. The project brings together a clinical decision-support technology company - Isabel Healthcare, with a UK University - Nottingham - supported by stakeholders - other UK Universities, Health Education England (responsible for healthcare professionals in training) and NHS England's Academic Health Science Networks (responsible for spreading innovation across the NHS) in order to work on this challenge. An existing 'proof-of-concept' beta-version of the eLearning platform without clinical decision support technology was developed by Isabel, and enhanced in 2019 following the award of an internal fellowship grant by University of Nottingham. The project will consolidate that partnership, and transform the previous beta version into a fully functioning working prototype of the eLearning platform embedded with the clinical decision support technology and capable of generating virtual patient cases. This funding would be used to: 1 . Embed Isabel's clinical decision support technology into the authoring process for generating virtual patient cases so all cases are evidence-based and include relevant 'never miss' diagnoses 2 . Streamline the authoring process and optimise the process by which multimedia (anonymised digital audio, images or video) is integrated into virtual patient cases 3 . Integrate an assessment system that evaluates the performance of users on cases and their development over time can be easily seen, with areas in need of strengthening identified to them and their teachers	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	48672.0 GBP
1386	UFONIA LIMITED	UFONIA LIMITED	None	None	None	Automated telephone conversations to triage and reassure patients whilst at home	With the NHS focusing its efforts on managing the frontlines of the Covid-19 crisis, vast numbers of clinical appointments have been delayed or rescheduled. As the country recovers, we face a large and increasing backlog of clinic visits and waiting lists for operations. Understandably, this will create tremendous anxiety for patients both about their conditions and also about being "lost in the system". Administrative teams and clinicians will be under pressure to make sure individuals are not put at risk, and that patients are kept informed about the constantly changing situation. Our solution, Ufonia, delivers autonomous, natural language conversations with patients about their care over the telephone. Ufonia's artificial intelligence driven system can make calls to patients whose care has been postponed, to explain the current plans an organisation or team has for that patient, to answer common queries and to check in on how they're doing. The calls will provide an additional layer of reassurance to patients, whilst allowing teams to get up to date individualised information about each patient's situation and their specific concerns. From the point of view of a patient, this is a normal conversation from any home or mobile phone. Patients will not need to receive any training, access websites, download apps or be given new devices. The system will verify the identity of the individual, and provide a route for questions and concerns to be fed back directly to the clinical team. In contrast to human conducted telephone calls, Ufonia offers the ability to simultaneously and repeatedly contact large groups of patients. This replaces manual calls being made by skilled administrative and clinical staff with a new channel of two way communication. Despite the resource constraints faced by NHS organisations, care teams will have a tool to keep in touch with individuals who otherwise might feel abandoned. The content of the call is captured and analysed to allow care teams to more easily identify patients who may be at risk or who are particularly concerned for further review. The technology will initially be trialled at Oxford University Hospitals Foundation Trust. Patients, clinicians and administrative professionals will be involved in the process of refining the conversations and developing the platform. Following a successful pilot it will be made available across the NHS in time to help manage the aftermath of the initial peak of Covid-19 infections.

1387	ICENI DIAGNOSTICS LIMITED	ICENI DIAGNOSTICS LIMITED	None	None	None	Are you fit to work? A home test for COVID-19	In any infectious disease outbreak, the rapid triage of potential carriers of infection is essential to control the spread of infection and to allocate resources efficiently. We will repurpose the technology, most famously used in the pregnancy test, to create a new diagnostic to rapidly identify coronavirus carriers. This approach requires no infrastructure and can be used in the community with minimal training or expertise. This tool leads to a simple 'red line' output within 15 minutes, enabling early identification of infected individuals. Crucially, Iceni Diagnostics has successfully applied this technology for influenza diagnostics already; insight into how to adapt these tests for the detection of coronavirus is also in place. The scientific basis of this new test is to exploit the carbohydrates that coronaviruses attach to on human cells, which we will immobilise in our devices. The key advantage of this technology is that is easy to produce and can be scaled up, using established manufacture and distribution chains, to meet the substantial demands for immediate and recurrent coronavirus testing in the weeks and months ahead. It is intended to be used for triage - to enable large numbers of people to be tested with a +/- outcome, enabling positive response patients to be rapidly identified, quarantined and subjected to further testing, while enabling negative-response individuals to return to their normal work-life activities.

1388	TENSARC LIMITED	TENSARC LIMITED	None	None	None	Novel face mask design for source control of viruses as a low-tech tool to enhance social distancing	This project is a proof of concept to study the efficacy of a new type of mask for community-based source control. If efficacy can be established, this form of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) will be a new tool for enhancing social distancing and helping to get people back to work in a safe way. We will reframe the requirements analysis for source control PPE, validate emerging approaches, and assess various materials and design approaches. The goal is to assess a new type of mask (face gaiter) and compare it to existing masks for suitability as source control for non-medical purposes, to meet government guidelines and the physical requirements of extended work hours, job duties, and related social interaction. The face gaiter resembles existing sport face coverings but is engineered specifically for source control. It is also durable, machine washable and can be reused hundreds of times. One objective is to modernise the tools for source control; currently there is a reliance on masks designed for medical or hazardous materials environments, which may or may not be suitable for use by the general public over extended periods of time. Another objective is to help evolve reviews of source control options towards UK and international rating systems. The project addresses a long-standing need surfaced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Source control has been used to reduce the transmission rate of bacteria and viruses, such as when sick patients present to hospital. Surgical masks may be issued for source control to a symptomatic patient and to those accompanying the patient to account for asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases. A key deficiency in such masks is the quality of the seal where the mask meets the face: the masks are poor-fitting; do not accommodate facial hair; lay in close proximity to the mouth; and have low breathability. Taken together, expelled air can escape around the sides of the mask and reduce the effectiveness of this type of source control. All of these issues are addressed by the novel design of the face gaiter. When surgical masks are in short supply then a reusable alternative is advantageous. A source control tool suitable for extended use and re-use is timely due to the COVID-19 outbreak and it can support the Government's recovery from the pandemic by limiting the transmission of infection, e.g. in the delivery of essential services and more generally once restrictions on movement start to lift.

1389	RAZORSECURE LIMITED	RAZORSECURE LIMITED	None	None	None	Real time measurement of UK Rail Passengers to enable social distancing during a pandemic	The UK is currently experiencing severe disruption due to the Covid-19 lockdown, and ending the lockdown in a controlled way is vital to the UK's economic future. Public transport is critical to getting key workers to their jobs as well as for the wider UK economy to function efficiently. However, given the requirements under social distancing, the overcrowding of people on public transport could lead to faster transmission of Covid-19 leading to a potential second wave or aiding a future outbreak. RazorSecure provides cyber security intrusion and anomaly detection using machine learning to give real time visibility of networks onboard UK trains. We propose to extend the data we currently collect and produce new visualisations to give real time data regarding overcrowding of public transport to allow for more active management of social distancing while transiting the UK transport network. As a direct, actionable item, guards would be given an application that will allow them to inform passengers that a particular carriage is less crowded and operators would have a real-time dashboard to review crowding.

1391	MATHS WITH PARENTS LTD	MATHS WITH PARENTS LTD	None	None	None	Maths with Parents COVID-19 support	"Daddy, what's a number bond?" Parents across the country, balancing a host of other things, are now suddenly being hit by questions like these from their children. Maths education has developed significantly since we were at school. New techniques and manipulatives are used in class and children enjoy solving problems and exploring concepts to a greater depth. Unfortunately, many of these children's parents have not been brought along with these developments. Without effective support at this time, parents will find it hard to support and children will struggle to develop their maths. The problem is greatest in disadvantaged communities, where parental engagement occurs less frequently, is less targeted and is overall less effective that in more affluent communities (Kalil, 2016). As our CEO Tom Harbour wrote recently in an article for the Times Education Supplement, resources to solve this problem "have to be carefully designed if they are to reach disadvantaged families. It is all too easy to half-bake support for parents, potentially helping to widen the disadvantage gap." Maths with Parents has been designed to motivate and empower parents in disadvantaged communities to have enjoyable learning experiences together with their children. We are working to ensure that every child is supported at home to fulfil their academic potential. Our platform enables teachers to assign topics to align with the curriculum they are teaching. Based on this, we provide a tailored package of support to each family, accessible on their phones. Parents receive a short video, presented by children, about the method their child is learning. The video is followed by fun games and activities to play together. These games connect the maths that the child is learning at school to real life activities at home, such as cooking, shopping and having dinner. Parents and children rate and leave comments about each activity that they complete, which give teachers valuable insight into pupils' learning at home. We work with the teachers to provide extra support for the disadvantaged families that need it. A month ago we were working with 85 schools. To support during Covid-19, we announced that we would offer our programme of support for free to schools during the school closures. We have had teachers from over 700 new schools register to join our programme. We now need to accelerate our product roadmap to ensure that we can respond to this huge demand and support disadvantaged families nationwide.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	49905.0 GBP

We are bonded by a common vision -- to elevate the teaching profession, and empower educators with the tools to drive their own success. We are the only global social network that gives teachers complete control over their professional profile, network, and career, and finally provides schools with an alternative to expensive recruitment agencies. Think LinkedIn but for education. The fact that teachers are overworked and under-resourced has never sat well with the teaglo team and this is even more apparent during COVID-19 . We share their frustration and want to do something about it. So, we're creating a tool to help teachers spend more time teaching and less time trolling through websites trying to find quality teaching resources... and often having to pay for the privilege. Our project goal is to build a free resource hub for teachers and schools to effortlessly find, create, and share everything they need to succeed in one place. That means attracting the very best classroom, extra-curricular, CPD, distance teaching, and wellbeing materials from across education and the wider working world to one site. No more tedious searching late into the night. No more lost weekends. Less time spent finding/creating resources, means more time improving student-outcomes, improved teacher-wellbeing, and more time for CPD.

1394	LB PARSONS LIMITED	LB PARSONS LIMITED	None	None	None	TutorHero - a revolution in primary tutoring	TutorHero is a Software as a Service (SaaS) product which automates the process of identifying knowledge gaps and developing individualised learning plans for tutees, guiding them to interactive video content which is most useful to them. Using machine learning to assess students, forms a consistent map of students' weak areas allowing the platform to automatically flag misconceptions that require 1-to-1 tutor-to-student intervention. This fully automated aspect of the system is referred to as "TutorBot". No other platform is able to provide consistently refined leaning plans and flag manual interventions at scale. The COVID-19 pandemic has hit education hard across the globe with 1.53 billion learners out of school (UNESCO) and 184 country-wide school closures, impacting 87.6% of the world's total enrolled learners. If left unaddressed, interruptions to education can have long term implications -- especially for the most vulnerable. TutorHero aims to address this quickly and at scale. In the short term, the platform will be tailored to helping UK students in Y5&6 fill knowledge gaps and re-join their level of competency as these students are in a critical stage of their education, due to transition from primary to secondary education, over 250 interactive videos will be available on launch. TutorBot periodically assesses students, creating a feedback loop which constantly measures and directs learning efforts, adjusting the students learning path based on their current understanding. Human tutors are not redundant though, TutorHero acts predominantly as a force multiplier, students are expected to receive 1-to-1 'live' support online to get the unique input and reinforcement they require in order to learn effectively for 5% of their learning. This 5 month project will develop and test TutorHero, ultimately producing an MVP to showcase its capabilities to target customers, parents and schools. After this project, the team intends to rapidly deploy the product to live environments and sign up the first users within 2-4 weeks. By rethinking how tutoring is delivered and developing TutorBot, the platform is able to deliver high-quality individual tutoring 75% cheaper than traditional alternatives, directing 95% of learning to prerecorded reusable content, this opens the door to households who have previously been unable to afford tutoring, creating new demand. Initially focussed on the UK educational system, the underlying technology has the potential to be integrated/adapted to suit any education system globally making global education more resilient to disruption and bringing tutoring into the 21st Century.

1395	INDEX PARTNERS LIMITED	INDEX PARTNERS LIMITED	None	None	None	Digital Sandbox - Online Hackathon Platform for University Students	The **Digital Sandbox project** will develop a solution for universities and employers to organise online hackathons and competitions (e.g. business idea challenge, coding hackathons, etc.) for students. Universities are increasingly using hackathons and competitions to help students acquire employability skills, develop employer networks as well as showcase their skills and ideas to academic and employer communities. Although no reliable statistics are available, estimates suggest ~10,000 hackathons take place in universities worldwide annually. US, UK, EU and Australia account for over 50% of events. However, the onset of Covid-19 pandemic prompted many universities to cancel these programs, thereby, depriving students of critical learning opportunities. While most universities readily adapted existing platforms and tools (e.g. Zoom, MS Teams, etc) to launch online classes and internships, they have been less successful in migrating their hackathons and competitions online due to a lack of appropriate tools. The "Digital Sandbox" project intends to address this gap. There is no existing tool or platform to help universities and employers conduct online hackathons for students, end-to-end. In the post Covid-19 era, our solution will help elevate the _scope_ and _impact_ of these programs (and the learning outcomes) to a higher level, by enabling: * Employers to conduct cross-university and, even cross-border hackathons and competitions; * More than 10x students to participate in these events, without the inherent limitations (e.g. venue capacity, commute time, etc.) of the physical world; * Students to form cross-University and cross-border teams and thereby expanding exposure and network; * Judges to offer clear and structured feedback to _all_ participants, thereby enhancing learning outcomes; * Students from disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g. with financial problems, physical disabilities, etc.) to participate in these opportunities by eliminating barriers to access; * Significant reduction of unit costs, and thereby making these programs more affordable and widespread. In summary, our solution will help Universities to conduct _more hackathons_ with _more students_ in a _more inclusive_ way with _better learning outcomes_ at a _lower unit cost_. This, in turn, will help reduce the employability skills gap in the UK at a faster pace.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	49485.0 GBP
1396	HELIAQ UK LTD	HELIAQ UK LTD	None	None	None	Low-Cost Powered Respirators Allowing Service Businesses to Resume Operation	The ease with which COVID-19 spreads has caused most service businesses, which rely on person-to-person contact, to cease operation. This is causing massive economic damage in many sectors of the economy, including healthcare (e.g. dentists), personal services (e.g. hairdressers), small retailers, repair shops, etc. Furthermore, it is likely that many of these businesses will have to remain closed for many months, leading to many of them not surviving. The businesses that do survive will further face significant consumer fear, and therefore reduced income, for an extended duration after the lock-downs are lifted. What is urgently needed is technology that will allow most of these businesses to re-open as soon as possible, even at reduced capacity, while simultaneously preventing the spread of COVID-19 . In this project we are rapidly developing a low-cost powered respirator system that will allow service deliverers to be in close proximity to customers with negligible risk of transmission. Hospital experience has shown that simple face masks, even with face shields, are largely ineffective in close proximity and service providers have to wear full-face masks for effective protection. However, a new development is needed since, in addition to the worldwide shortage of respirators and consumables (i.e. filters), all current respirator systems exhaust the wearers exhaled air directly into the face of the customer. Clearly this only provides protection for the wearer, and not the customer. The new respirator system would be far cheaper and more viable than distributing tens of millions of full-face respirators and a supply of filters to most businesses and members of the public.

1397	CYBERLIVER LIMITED	CYBERLIVER LIMITED	None	None	None	Cirrhosis Remote Care Management impacted by COVID-19	The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated an unusual allocation of healthcare resources which inevitably, _negatively impacts on resources available to care for patients with chronic diseases like cirrhosis (scarring of the liver in advanced disease)_, who still require high levels of medical oversight. Unlike many chronic diseases, cirrhosis mortality is increasing exponentially; it is the third cause of premature death in working-age people, with 62,000 years of working life lost/year, and NHS care costs  >£3.5bn. In 2019, there were 73,669 UK hospital admissions from cirrhosis. 25% of all cirrhosis patients are at risk of needing acute treatment for complications such as fluid overload, confusion, kidney dysfunction, infections, and gastrointestinal bleeding. These patients _require a regular clinical assessment_ and even when discharged following a recent hospital admission, have _re-admission rates approaching 40% in 6 weeks_. During the current pandemic, such patients have limited access to direct clinical review, and many avoid hospital for fear of infection. Invariably this has meant that many cirrhosis patients will not receive the level of care they need and will incur further morbidity and mortality, not currently captured by the reported Government COVID-19 statistics. This project aims to address this clinical need by remote monitoring of at-risk cirrhosis patients, using remotely acquired important vital signs such as heart rate and blood pressure, (using low cost, blue-tooth, low energy wearable technology), and assessment of higher mental function and weight (established smartphone app tools), all of which are key metrics that are perturbed as cirrhosis advances. By efficiently collating this data on CyberLiver Ltd.'s modified, existing platform set-up for management of alcoholic liver disease, our 'CirrhoCare' platform intends to improve the clinical workflow such that vital data is organised and presented to clinicians on a dashboard, to facilitate informed, remote telemedicine 'consultations'. This will allow early detection of signs of cirrhosis complications in the community, and rapid triage of patients needing early direct clinical review, at a time when this is a limited resource. Our solution will prioritise care whilst limiting risk of COVID-19 exposure, and also personalising this to an individual patient's needs and disease, making it more acceptable and convenient for patients. In the long term, costs efficiencies will arise through more streamlined outpatient direct contacts, potentially applicable to a wider liver disease remit, and with scalable processes, whilst delivery costs will reduce further as this technology is more widely adopted, in a digitized NHS.

The EMTEC software development team has extensive experience of vehicle tracking using GNSS location data and Bluetooth and will be able to deploy people tracking technology onto its existing cloud-based platform using apps installed on mobile phones. The project team is developing analysis methods that can identify users, localise them based on triangulation with the aid of Wifi signals inside buildings and then applying machine learning methods to build a true contact graph with probabilities. For example, not only staff in contact with COVID-19 patients will be high risk but also the people that interact with them. The immediate goal of the contact tracking is to be able to trace back all high-risk contacts when a new infection is determined and implement targeted testing. Contact tracking is a critical technology to manage staff levels and keep hospitals and other companies operational while managing risk. The project has an essential priority on establishing and observing the privacy protection issues required by management and staff. The privacy protection analysis will be based on USA Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPS) and European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to ensure global viability. The solution will be ready for wider global community deployment by September 2020 .	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	49827.0 GBP
1399	SELAZAR LIMITED	SELAZAR LIMITED	None	None	None	Return Robin, contactless retail returns consolidation platform	Return Robin is a software development project to consolidate the collection of returns from households and neighbourhoods across the country. This tool enables retailers, couriers and logistics companies to coordinate their return operations assuring a single courier and vehicle is being used for all the retail returns within a household or area. This will free up delivery drivers and vehicles to assure vital food and essentials reach those who need them most. Round Robin also allows retailers, couriers, and consumers to streamline the management of returns, collections and tracking in one easy to use the platform without consumers having to leave their homes. During the Covid-19 outbreak, there has been a dramatic increase in online shopping due to the limitations of operating at physical retail outlets. This online presence allows retail businesses to operate (at worst at a reduced level) but it is considerably difficult for consumers to return goods they have received. People cannot get too physical locations such as high street shops, Post Offices or courier drop off points because leaving the house would increase the risk to public health and many of these shops are now closed. A phased delivery will see the consumer, retailer and courier registration and integrations created first, allowing consumers to register and for retailers to align collections with couriers. This will mean that retailers can provide pickup information to the consumer which the consumer gets from the Return Robin portal. The second phase will allow retailers to consolidate returned at a centralized warehouse. These returns can then be sent back in bulk to the retailers to reduce pressure on courier operations while also reducing costs for retailers.	UK Research and Innovation	Research Grant	49986.0 GBP

A Public Health Emergency was declared for COVID-19 to galvanize global collaboration to support less resources nations; this must include research to address the unknowns and ensure equity in who benefits from findings and interventions. We propose to further develop a proven mechanism for supporting locally-led evidence generation by facilitating knowledge sharing between all the networks and getting information and support to where research capacity is low. During the Ebola and Zika outbreak The Global Health Network served an important role in delivering and sharing trusted research tools, guidance and training which facilitated faster, standardised quality data capture. Beyond these outbreaks we have been working with our partners to create lasting research networks to support evidence generation in challenging settings. Here we will take our experience and add new innovative technology to make highly targeted information, tools and resources discoverable and support rapid implementation of new knowledge as this outbreak evolves. Our global partners are asking for such a mechanism, and here we can use the platform, our community, technolology and expertise to address the immediate need for global sharing and research support at this crucial point. What we learn here can then be applied to future outbreaks.	Medical Research Council	P&Cs	299860.0 GBP
