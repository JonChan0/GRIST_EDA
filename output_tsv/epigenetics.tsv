In animals and plants the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) is involved in maintaining genes in an epigenetic 'off' state. In mammals and flies a second complex, PRC1, collaborates with PRC2 to maintain silencing. Interestingly, other organisms including worms and plants lack PRC1 and it remains elusive how they achieve stable silencing. In Arabidopsis the DNA-binding protein VRN1 is a potential candidate to fulfil such a role in silencing. During a cold-induced process called vernalization, the floral repressor gene FLC is epigenetically repressed and maintained inactive by a plant PRC2 and VRN1. Lack of VRN1 does not impair PRC2 function but seems to act downstream or in parallel of PRC2, a situation analogous to animal PRC1. Moreover, as found for mammalian PRC1, VRN1 interacts with a component of the spliceosome complex, implying RNA processing in Polycomb silencing. The above findings suggest that VRN1, despite its lack of homology with PRC1 components, functions in the stable maintenance of PRC2 mediated silencing. My aim is to establish a solid foundation for a mechanistic understanding of VRN1 mediated gene silencing using vernalization as a model. In-depth VRN1 protein-complex analysis will be complemented by chromatin and RNA immuno-precipitations (ChIP and RIP) as well as theoretical modelling of the vernalization process. Besides addressing a long-standing question in plant epigenetics, collected data will allow comparison with the situation in non-plant systems to develop a mechanistic consensus model on maintenance of gene silencing in different kingdoms. Notably, for both plants and humans, fundamental knowledge of epigenetics will facilitate the modulation of gene expression to; increase yield and disease resistance in crops and develop treatments for diseases, such as cancer, in humans.

The huge diversity of carbohydrates is reflected in a multiplicity of function; in addition to acting as energy sources, carbohydrates play major roles in structure, signalling and epigenetics. The work programme will build upon the applicant's excellence in the mechanistic and structural enzymology of carbohydrate-active enzymes to tackle the key challenges of modern cellular glycobiology. Our vision is to provide fundamental structural and mechanistic-dissection of key proteins and their complexes and to use these as the foundation to deliver enzyme inhibitors as tools to probe the cellular function of specific glycans. The programme's three strands will each scale a major pinnacle of carbohydrate biochemistry. Strand 1 will focus on mammalian glycosidases involved in glycocerebroside metabolism and genetic disease. We will unlock new 3-D information for glycocerebrosidase 2 (GBA2) and use these together with GBA1 to design and exploit novel and specific enzyme inhibitors as mechanistic and cellular probes, novel chaperones and imaging agents. Strand 2 will focus on the key endoplasmic reticulum enzyme endomannosidase, both its mechanistic novelty and its exploitation to perturb cellular glycans to unlock its biological roles and deliver compounds for anti-viral therapeutics. Strand 3 will probe the modification and elaboration of specific human N-glycans and their role in cell surface receptor biology. It will focus on the GlcNAc transferase V catalysed formation of polylactosamine epitopes and their regulation of growth factor signalling at the cell surface both in health and cancerous tissues. GlycoPOISE will both answer cardinal structural and chemical mechanistic questions in the enzymology of glycobiology and inform strategies for the observation and inhibition of carbohydrate-active enzymes and their exploitation	European Research Council	Advanced Grant	2500000.0	EUR

However, its biological significance is still poorly understood. Recent technological advances have shown that m6A methylation occurs in >7000 transcripts and has also led to the identification of enzymes which make this RNA modification dynamic and reversible. As such, reversible m6A methylation may have critical roles in gene regulation analogous to dynamically regulated DNA and protein modifications. Thus, dynamically reversible RNA modifications, such as m6A methylation, represent an emerging layer of gene regulation at the RNA level, termed RNA epigenetics or epitranscriptomics. We have exciting preliminary data to suggest Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) manipulates pathways which regulate m6A methylation. As such, this provides an excellent model to study the fundamental regulatory aspects of m6A methylation at an RNA epigenetic level. Our preliminary data shows that the KSHV ORF57 protein redistributes the recently identified RNA m6A demethylase, human fat mass and obesity (FTO)-associated protein, from nuclear speckles into the nucleolus. Moreover, this redistribution results in alterations within the m6A methylation status of viral and cellular mRNAs. Specifically, FTO redistribution dramatically reverses viral mRNA m6A methylation while increasing cellular mRNA m6A methylation status. The aim of this project is to determine what implications virus-mediated FTO redistribution and manipulation of the m6A methylation pathway has upon cellular and viral m6A methylomes. We will examine what effect altering the m6A methylation status has upon the fate and function of viral and cellular mRNAs. In addition, we will test the requirement of FTO redistribution and alterations in the m6A methylome for virus replication and assess the therapeutic potential of inhibiting this virus-based manipulation of the m6A methylation pathway as a novel antiviral strategy.

Genetic studies have shown that genomic imprinting occurs at dosage-sensitive genes regulating important developmental processes. In human, altered imprinted gene expression is associated with growth, metabolic and neurological disorders, and cancer. Over the past 30 years, genomic imprinting has emerged as a paradigm contributing to our understanding of the roles of epigenetic modifications in the regulation of gene activity and repression, and to mechanisms underlying the epigenetic control of genome function in pathways important for development, health and disease. In this application we propose a series of experiments addressing three key important biomedically relevant topics concerning the regulation, function and evolution of genomic imprinting. These studies are designed not only to better understand imprinting in development and disease, but also to generate more widespread functional and regulatory insights into the epigenetic control of transcriptional dosage, and its impact on normal and abnormal phenotypes. Our three main aims are: 1 - To understand the extent and implications of parental-origin specific allelic bias. 2 - To further study one of the most biomedically relevant imprinted genes, Dlk1, and the previously uncharacterised non-imprinted Dlk2 gene from whence it arose, to assess the regulation, function and evolution of these remarkable paralogues in mammals using neurogenesis as a paradigm. 3 - To determine whether canonical imprinting, an essential mammalian regulator of nutritional resources, plays a role in the mammary gland - a key site of postnatal maternal-offspring interactions important for lifelong offspring health.

With few exceptions, these changes occur without changes to DNA sequence. Changes in epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, histone variant deposition and the presence of non-nucleosomal chromatin-associated proteins are strongly linked to the transitions from totipotent to pluripotent stem cells, and precursor cells to fully differentiated somatic cells. Little is known about these interlaced systems work and interact. In this Collaboration Grant we propose to bring together a pre-eminent group of UK scientists working on epigenetics and chromatin during development. Our current funded research programmes are aimed at various and extensive epigenetic analyses of diverse ?developmental? cell-types; including primordial germ cells, developing oocytes, ES cells, blastocysts, TS cells, placenta, fetal liver and adult tissues. Presently these analyses are to be performed with real-time PCR, Sequenom massarray, or microarray based profiling, etc. Each of these techniques is limiting, either in terms of the number of samples or datapoints that can be assessed (PCR and Sequenom) or in the quality and quantitative value of data returned (array techniques). Rather than simply focussing on own little parts of the genome we propose to collaborate in the establishment of a new facility, to take advantage of improvements in DNA sequencing technology to create a database of genome-wide datasets representing an epigenetic time course through development. With the aid of an Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Solexa) massively parallel sequencing system we will generate genome-wide datasets for each experiment, rather than a tiny fragment of the genome. This will allow us to investigate the specific questions outlined in our present research programmes, while at the same time dramatically increasing the output and quality of each experiment. The data from each of the applicants will be deposited in a searchable database curated by the proposed postdoc. The net effect will be to create a programme that is substantially larger, more encompassing and providing much greater insight than the sum of the previous constituent parts. This collaborative database will foster interaction and sharing of expertise between applicants as well as create a shared resource for collaborative publications that would not have been possible without this grant.

5	Professor Andrew Prentice	MRC Unit, The Gambia	None	2008-04-01	2018-01-31	Nutritional Genetics	Nutritional genetics covers research on the role of genetic variation on dietary responses as well as evolutionary aspects of nutritional regulation of gene expression. We employ genetic and epigenetic tools to explore critical pathways that underpin or modulate nutritionally-mediated health and disease outcomes. The key driver of the Nutritional Genetics theme within the ING is the need to provide mechanistic insights into the underlying processes. The Keneba Biobank, a repository of biological samples involving the whole of the rural population of West Kiang (N~12000), presents a resource and major platform for our genetic research. Due to its tight integration across the other ING areas of research, Nutritional Genetics is a cross-cutting theme; we concentrate on the following two sub-themes: 1) Genetics and epigenetics of growth and development. Over several decades our group has collected DNA, birth size and child growth records on individuals living in rural Gambia. This is being used to understand which genes affect growth trajectories employing multi-generational, cross-sectional and longitudinal study designs in combination with high-throughput genome-wide association study (GWAS) and ExomeSNPChip genotyping arrays. Our epigenetics studies test the hypothesis that differences in maternal nutritional status during the periconceptional period influences the establishment of epigenetic signatures in the next generation. Our results on pre-natal supplementation and seasonal differences in dietary intakes demonstrate that maternal nutritional status during early pregnancy causes persistent and systemic DNA methylation changes in their offspring postnatally. 2) Genetics of nutrition-mediated infection. Our past and ongoing research demonstrated that viral, bacterial and host genetic factors modulate iron homeostasis and hence the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. Our future work focuses on seeking to identify genetic variants that affect phenotype variations of iron absorption and metabolism in Gambians. Risk alleles associated with iron deficiency and anemia will be ascertained in a first stage and in a second stage their potential functional effects on phenotypic outcomes including infection will be evaluated.

This has led to the development of HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) which can upregulate frataxin (Festenstein, 2006; Herman et al., 2006) and are therefore potential treatments for this, as yet, untreatable and devastating condition. This proposal is to take forward a particular HDACi, known as compound z (due to patent restrictions), which we have found to be effective in up-regulating frataxin greater than 2-fold in lymphoblastoid cell lines and primary cells from patients with FRDA. Direct comparison with the HDACi, 4b, shows it to be more effective and it is certainly less toxic. As compound z has already been shown to have an excellent safety profile in humans and to cross the blood brain barrier, it has clear potential as a therapy for FRDA. We will now investigate its effects in humanised mouse models of FRDA. Thus, we will treat mice with the inhibitor and analyse the tissues that are characteristically affected by FRDA, such studies are clearly not possible in humans. Tissues will be analysed for FXN expression, FXN chromatin structure and for pathological changes. The mice will also be crossed to epigenetic-modifier mice to further dissect the mechanism of silencing and mechanism of action of this and other potential novel treatments at the chromatin/transcriptional level. FRDA can therefore be seen as a prototypic disease in which gene-silencing is the cause. We are well-placed to undertake this study as all the necessary techniques are already well established in the lab. Moreover, the CSC has a critical mass of researchers interested in epigenetics making this an ideal environment to pursue these studies. Compound z has a real possibility to become a treatment for FRDA, this study will go a long way to developing this potential.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	372376.0	GBP
10	Prof Richard Meehan	University of Edinburgh	None	2018-04-01	2023-03-31	The functional requirement for epigenetic systems in development and disease	Epigenetics can be defined as an alteration in gene activity that is mitotically stable in the absence of a change in DNA sequence. In practice it represents a combination of observations and suggested mechanisms that are thought to functionally organize the genome to regulate gene expression, preserve genome integrity, propagate cell identity and govern transcriptional responses to external stimuli. Our aim is to determine the molecular mechanisms of epigenetic gene regulation that are associated with DNA modification in development and by implication in disease model systems Recent work (including our own) in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) suggests that signal transduction pathways determine epigenetic states and not vice-versa. Most surprisingly we find that cell transition states in ESCs (primed to ground state and vice versa) are independent of global DNA methylation status. This work resulted in system with which we can directly investigate the mechanisms involved in over-riding the repressive effects of DNA methylation at target promoters, which will have important implications for understanding how activation and silencing of DNA methylated genes (and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs)) occurs in development and disease. Our previous analysis suggested that general aberrant promoter hypermethylation in cancer does not necessarily directly promote tumorigenesis, but instead reinforces transcription repression inherited from pre-cancerous tissue. Our work in ESCs has led us to develop new models to explain the molecular basis of this observation, which potentially de-links de novo methylation of promoters as a direct driver of disease processes and perhaps physiologic states (ageing). We have also observed that global DNA methylation states impacts on Polycomb Repression Complexes (PRC1 and 2) dependent chromatin compaction in the nucleus of embryonic stems cells (ESCs). Currently we are investigating the molecular models involved in facilitating DNA methylation directed changes in higher order chromatin organisation and its relevance to developmental gene regulation. We use various ESC models and in vitro models for early development to address how defects in defined aspects of the DNA methylation machinery influence the transition of stem cells to more committed cell fates. Increased understanding of these basic processes underpins the interpretation and relevance of altered epigenetic profiles in disease, ageing, drug screening programs and environmental exposure.

In recognition of the importance of the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) our research takes a lifecourse approach from conception to ageing. We focus on five sub-themes each of which addresses an important area of diet-related disease. Early Growth and Development: We seek to understand the interplay between diet, infection, poor hygiene and gut dysfunction in causing growth failure and associated deficits in cognitive development. We also conduct randomised controlled trials of micronutrient supplements in pregnancy and early childhood with outcomes related to growth, iron status and anemia, immune function and cognition. Nutritional Genetics and Epigenetics: We have demonstrated that a mother’s diet around conception affects DNA methylation in her offspring with likely influences on later disease. A major focus of our on-going work seeks to understand precisely which nutrients are critical to these processes, which genomic regions are affected and why, how methylation differences at these loci affect placental and fetal development, and what are the likely lifelong consequences. This work could help define peri-conceptional diets (or nutrient supplements) to optimise placental, fetal and lifelong outcomes. Iron, Infection and Anemia: The discovery of hepcidin, the master regulator of iron metabolism, has provided important new insights into the links between diet, infection and iron deficiency anemia. We have described how low-grade inflammation, especially related to airways infection, induces hepcidin-mediated blockade of iron absorption, and are testing ways to circumvent the blockade in randomised controlled trials in pregnant mothers, very young infants and pre-school children. Calcium, Vitamin D and Bone Health: Most populations in low- and middle-income countries have very low calcium intakes. We have studied the effects of such diets on bone health throughout life with an increasing emphasis on older persons and on the related condition of sarcopenia. Nutrition-Related Chronic Diseases: As the demographic transition hits Africa there are increasing numbers of overweight and obese people, especially women. In a new programme of work we seek to understand the metabolic mechanisms leading to atypical African diabetes and hypertension with a view to defining new public health interventions and to help guide pharmacologic treatment choices.

About a decade or so ago, African health services were dealing principally with infectious diseases. While these continue to have a high burden, chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are increasingly becoming major contributors to morbidity and mortality in the region. There is however indication that NCDs in Africa may not manifest in a different way compared to the classical presentations in high-income countries. For example, the limited data available, including from our recent studies, suggest that type 2 diabetes and hypertension occur in relatively young and lean people in Africa. The biological mechanisms for this apparent heightened susceptibility are unknown, but may relate to environmental exposures (eg malnutrition), particularly early in life, which can influence long term risk of disease (perhaps by affecting organ size or via epigenetics). Our research will combine epidemiological studies and deep clinical and laboratory phenotyping to accurately document the burden and risk factors diabetes. In one study, we will address gestational diabetes (GDM) which, when not properly managed, is associated with significant morbidity to the mother and child. The true burden of GDM in Uganda (and most African countries) is not known, because of a lack of high quality studies. The objectives here are to 1) accurately document the burden, determinants and outcomes (fetal and maternal) of GDM; 2) using a combination of demographic, clinical and biochemical markers, develop as risk scoring tool that might be used to identify women at high risk of GDM who should be targeted for screening; 3) undertake formative research to gain a detailed understanding and document barriers and facilitators to GDM care, to inform a future intervention study to improve GDM care. Our second study will involve phenotyping of “type 2” diabetes. The primary objective is to describe, in detail, the metabolic and immunologic profile of newly diagnosed adult diabetic patients in Uganda in order to fully understand the unique phenotype of black African diabetic patients. Specifically, using dynamic testing, we will assess the contribution of defects in insulin secretion and/or insulin resistance, the role of inflammation and immunity and the frequency and determinants of co-morbidity with components of the metabolic syndrome (eg hypertension and dyslipidaemia). This work will not only help us to better understanding of the pathophysiology (including the contributions of beta cell dysfunction and insulin resistance), might lead to identification of novel biomarkers (and therapeutic targets) for the risk of developing diabetes and its progression, as well as a more rational use of the existing drugs.

18	Professor John Isaacs	Newcastle University	Institute of Cellular Medicine	2017-04-01	2021-03-31	MICA: BIOlogical Factors that Limit sustAined Remission in rhEumatoid arthritis (the BIO-FLARE study)	Flares of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), are a major burden for patients. They occur unpredictably, adding to the physical and psychological burden of the condition, and contribute to joint damage and comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease. Flares are difficult to study, precisely because of their unpredictable timing. However, we have established a human model that generates a 'synchronized' population of RA patients in clinical remission, of whom about 50% flare within 6 months, the remainder maintaining remission. We propose to carefully study such a population to better understand the factors that determine disease flare. Up to a third of patients with RA achieve disease remission with aggressive therapy. Many wish to discontinue therapy at this point and, if they do, about 50% flare in the subsequent 6 months. We will follow such a population prospectively, to study the biological processes underpinning flare. We will study 150 patients in clinical remission for at least 6 months, and prepared to discontinue treatment. After treatment cessation patients will be studied intensively, with blood sampling at weeks 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24. Patients will also undergo ultrasound-guided biopsy of 'flaring' synovium before reinstatement of previous treatment (with which patients readily regain remission). We will also obtain biopsies from consenting patients at baseline and in remission at 6 months. In blood we will study immune cell subsets and their activation status; autoantibody profiles; and epigenetic profiles. Synovial biopsies will allow us to examine the cell lineages present, including stromal cell subtypes, as well as inflammatory mediators. We will additionally examine metabolic profiles in blood, urine and synoivum. Using multivariate statistical techniques we will develop a model that predicts impending flare in RA, highlighting tractable therapeutic pathways and informative biomarkers.

So far arcOGEN has discovered nine novel OA signals. What is emerging as an area of increasing interest is the understanding that epigenetic effects can impact on the penetrance of genetic susceptibility, for example by modulating the expression of a susceptibility allele, and that integrating genetics and epigenetics can therefore clarify genetic association signals. We have shown this in our recent publication, where we demonstrated that CpG methylation impacts on the OA susceptibility coded for by GDF5. In this application we shall conduct a comprehensive DNA methylation analysis of the genes from within the arcOGEN association signals. We shall use nucleic acid from patient cartilage and a quantitative methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) protocol. Our data will allow us to assess in which genes CpG methylation correlates with the association signals and as such it will allow us to narrow those signals, by highlighting functional regions, and will enable us to assess the degree to which the signals are modulated epigenetically.

Modified bases are of fundamental importance to transcriptional programming and cell identity during and after development. The role of the cytosine derivative 5-formylcytosine and its influence on nucleosome formation, active enhancers, transcription and cell identity will be one area of focus to build mechanistic understanding, following on from hypotheses derived from our prior work. There will also be an investigation of 5-carboxycytosine and 5-hydroxymethyluridine and their potential links with transcription regulation. For other modified bases, such as N6-methyladenine, we will develop and use new chemical mapping/sequencing methods to elucidate their function in mammalian systems. The programme will include a systematic discovery of other natural DNA base modifications, building on and augmenting chemical methodologies I have developed to discover and profile modified bases in RNA. The function of newly identified base modifications will be investigated during the programme. The insights provided from these fundamental studies may have far-reaching consequences for normal biology and disease states.

A number of exciting technologies have recently been developed by which the derivation of embryonic stem (ES) cells from adult cell types is now possible. This includes the transfer of reprogramming factors into adult cells, resulting in the generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Inducing `pluripotency is of direct relevance to regenerative medicine as it enables specific cell populations and tissues to be generated from/for patients. However, this technology is inefficient and a particular bottleneck appears to be the reprogramming of the epigenome. Epigenetics or the epigenome refers to all the modifications to DNA and chromatin that are important for the function of the genome in the context of development and in the adult organism in different organs and tissues. Importantly, in germ cells (that develop into eggs or sperm) and early embryos, the epigenome is reprogrammed on a genome- wide scale, so that development of a new organism and new stem cells is possible. Work in our laboratory and others has revealed several features of this genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming. In collaboration with the company CellCentric, we have begun to set up a number of systematic screens for the isolation of epigenetic reprogramming factors. The current programme of work with CellCentric aims to assess the function of these new reprogramming factors in germ cells and early embryos, ES cells, and in the generation of iPS cells. CellCentric will in particular work on the isolation of small molecules that can alter the function of our reprogramming factors, which will then be tested in ES and iPS cells. The combined programme of work will shed new light on the fundamental process of epigenetic reprogramming, and provide new tools for the manipulation of stem cells and the translation into approaches to regenerative medicine and healthy ageing.

Current methods are inadequate for the detection of low abundance siRNA. I have identified the limitations of these procedures and propose three improvements: 1, better siRNA retention on hybridisation supports; 2, a novel siRNA enrichment procedure; 3, a novel amplification based method. Cross kingdom applicability of each method will be tested using natural plant and mammalian siRNA. Novel siRNA from the mouse Xist locus will be analysed in detail using the most successful method developed.	Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council	grant	184735.0	GBP

Nearly all common diseases and traits have now been found to be heritable and GWA studies are discovering many novel genes. However 95% of the heritability is not yet identified and discordances within identical (MZ) twin pairs cannot be explained by known environmental factors. The missing heritability could be due to epigenetic factors - which are ideally studied with twins. The proposed study uses MZ twins discordant for 10 important age-related complex disease traits to uncover epigenetic signals that are associated with disease. We will study in detail epigenetic differences using a high throughput Illumina methylation array in the 5% most discordant pairs for the following disease susceptibility traits : obesity (BMI), type II diabetes (insulin resistance) , hypertension (BP), hyperlipidemia (lipid levels), Osteoporosis (BMD), biological aging (white cell telomere levels), Allergy (IgE) , asthma (FEV1), platelet volume (MPV) and smoking. We will use the TwinsUK cohort of 3000 phenotyped MZ twins for a discovery group. For replication of the most significant associations we will use singletons from the 200 extreme highs and lows of the remaining 4000 phenotyped twins as a ?case'-?control ?association study genotyped by the same array. A sub-sample will be genotyped by sequencing. To assess tissue specificity, additional tissues for methylation analysis will be sampled (buccal, fat and skin DNA). Causality will be explored using bioinformatics, cell specificity experiments and longitudinal studies using DNA stored for upto 15 years- as well as parental and offspring DNA. Epigenetics is a major future growth area for genomics. This large scale study would enable us to maintain a European lead and act also a valuable future epidemiologic resource and enable important collaborations with other European researchers and cohorts.

Advances in understanding the detailed mechanisms of epialleles formation in response to environmental cues and their heritable maintenance in a model plant such as Arabidopsis will be the starting objective of the AENEAS proposal. To this end, we will focus on three epigenetic regulatory pathways, which have been well characterized for their interaction with environmental signals in mediating changes into the epigenome. They are: the autonomous, the small RNA and the CpG methylation pathways. The outcome of this research activity will be a road map for plant environmental epigenetics, necessary for further progress of the basic research in this area and for the transfer of the knowledge to crop plants. Concomitantly, the constitution of an 'Environmental Epigenetics platform' for maize, will start with the development of tools indispensable for the shift of epigenetic research from Arabidopsis to maize. This will be achieved by the functional characterization of maize mutants for epi-regulators belonging to the three pathways studied in Arabidopsis. The tools will comprise: maize epi-regulator mutants, their targets, and information about their interaction with environmental cues for epialleles formation and inheritance throughout generations. It is our opinion that the deliverables from AENEAS will be the 'progenitors' for the next-generation of breeding programs, based on the exploitation of the environmental-induced epigenetics variability. In addition, we will conduct a comparative genomics analysis of data arising from the project to generate comparative models for environmental epigenomics in two evolutionary distinct species such as Arabidopsis and maize.

Specifically, our proposal addresses how alternative nucleic acid secondary structures and chemical modifications on nucleobases regulate genome function, and comprises three inter-related elements.MethodsOur chemical biology programme uniquely integrates molecular biophysics and organic chemistry with cellular and molecular biology and genomics. Aims1. DNA G-quadruplexes- genome function and stabilityAccumulated evidence implicates four-stranded secondary structures called G-quadruplexes (G4) in genome function. Recent discoveries, from our lab and others, have shown that G4s exist in human cells with increased occurrence in several cancers, and that G4s in oncogenes and telomeres can be targeted by small molecules, suggesting potential for therapeutic intervention. Specific goals: a) Understand the detailed relevance of G4 formation to the cancer cell state.b) Elucidate the relationships between G4s, DNA damage and genome instability which are hallmarks of cancer.c) Develop new synthetic lethality approaches that exploit targeting G4s with small molecules.2. RNA G-quadruplexes- regulating transcription and translationWe recently demonstrated that RNA G4s (rG4s) are present in cellular RNA.Furthermore, we have identified oncogenes that comprise a G4-motif in their 5?UTR that may influence oncogene translation.Specific goals:a) Generate maps of where rG4s form in the transcriptome and how these change in the cancer cell state.b) Characterise proteins that form rG4-protein interactions.c) Elucidate the regulatory influence of rG4s on translation in cancer. 3. Modified DNA bases- epigenetics and gene expression Chemical modifications to nucleobases can be critical regulators of gene expression and inheritance, and epigenome changes can be associated with cancer progression. We have developed innovative chemistry-based technologies for accurate quantification and single-base resolution mapping of 5-methylcytosine (5mC), 5-hydroxymethlcytosine (5hmc) and 5-formylcytosine (5fC), that will be employed to elucidate the function of these (and other) modified bases.Specific goals:a) Elucidate the dynamics and maintenance of 5mC/5hmC.b) Investigate the mechanisms that perturb 5mC/5hmC dynamics in cancer.c) Evaluate base modifications as possible cancer biomarkers.d) Explore 5fC and other new modified bases in genome function and cancer.How the results of this research will be usedOur results will illuminate the fundamental mechanisms of genome function in cancer, provide tools and data that ultimately may improve diagnosis, and generate novel approaches for future therapeutic strategies.

The heritable nature of the expression phase is a direct result of inheritance of the DNA methylation state at agn43, and the regulation is by definition epigenetic. The processes that facilitate this inheritance during the various stages of the cell cycle are unclear. The specific objectives of this proposal are: 1) Identify the relative roles of OxyR, Dam and SeqA for inheritance of the methylated state of agn43 DNA. 2) Determine the role of DNA replication for agn43 epigenetic regulation. The approaches that will be used include quantitative analyses of protein-DNA interactions in vitro and in vivo analysis of agn43 phase variation in various mutant isolates. Ag43 expression contributes to the development of bacterial communities, and thus elucidating how its expression is controlled over many generations will also increase our understanding of the formation of phenotypic distinct bacterial populations.

These adaptations include metabolic and endocrine changes that may lead to life-long changes in the function and structure the body - a concept which has been termed fetal programming. The suggestion is that the baby receives from its mother a forecast of the nutritional environment it will receive after birth and modifies its metabolism, whole body physiology and growth trajectory appropriately to maximise its chances of survival postnatally. However these adaptations become detrimental if the conditions after birth are not the same as the ones encountered during early life. The inappropriate programming results in a considerably higher susceptibility to developing chronic diseases of adult life. This Developmental Origins of Health and Disease hypothesis proposes that disorders such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes may result from an imbalance between the environment experienced in utero and that experienced postnatally. This hypothesis has been supported by numerous epidemiological studies which have shown an association between low birth weight and later disease and also by studies in animals. The dominant research focus to date has been the defining of the physiological adaptations and metabolic changes in both human and animal studies. However, very few studies have addressed the molecular mechanisms by which a phenomenon that occurs in utero has a phenotypic consequence many years later. Epigenetics refers to covalent modifications of DNA and core histones which are heritable and affect genome function (transcription, recombination, replication) without altering the nucleotide sequence of DNA. Epigenetic mechanisms are essential for development and differentiation and create a memory" of cell identity. Importantly, epigenetic modifications can be modulated by nutritional factors and can act as reversible switches of gene expression to heritably maintain specific genomic regions in a transcriptionally silent or active state. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is therefore an attractive candidate mechanism for fetal programming because it confers and maintains cellular "memory" for many cell divisions. The aim of this proposal is to establish a mechanistic link between maternal diet during pregnancy, epigenetic states of the genome and the developmental origins of adult disease. Using an integrated approach combining molecular biology, whole animal nutritional programming and functional genomics, epigenomics on a defined cell type, the pancreatic beta cell, we will address the following issues. Firstly, we will establish if the epigenetic state of the genome can be altered due to nutritional programming in utero and if such changes can explain programmed changes in gene expression. Secondly, we will identify the critical time windows by which epigenetic memory and gene activity are established by fetal programming. Finally, we will manipulate DNA methylation of key metabolic genes in vitro and profile the transcriptional and metabolic consequences. We will achieve these aims using our well established maternal protein restriction model of fetal programming. Understanding the mechanisms involved in intrauterine nutritional programming could ultimately lead to diagnosis, prevention and potential treatment of long term effects of maternal diet on adult health."

Evidence is mounting that maternal obesity is also a risk for adverse programming. However, exploration of the mechanistic basis of programming is challenging, as animal models of obesity generally use hypercaloric diets based upon a narrow range of pure fats or sugars. These may have effects independently of maternal body composition. A cafeteria diet (a varying panel of highly palatable foods) is known to have a programming effect on glucose homeostasis in rodents, through epigenetic modification and altered expression of the insulin-signalling pathway. This project will utilize an established rat model of cafeteria feeding to investigate tissue sensitivity of such effects and the role of epigenetics in programming the insulin-signalling pathway. The relative contributions of maternal obesity and over-feeding to establishing metabolic and cardiovascular phenotypes will be dissected through cross-fostering and staged feeding experiments.

This will enable producers to move animal breeding and production towards more sustainable, environmentally and welfare friendly, low-input systems, that deliver safe and high quality foods in line with consumer expectations and European Policy. Our overall strategy is to combine the power of gene mapping technologies, gene expression studies in target tissues and modern bioinformatics tools with available and expanded genome sequences, to determine the origin of genetic variation in key quality safety, health and sustainability traits in realworld livestock populations. Research will be clustered in three areas: development of underpinning technologies and knowledge, including mathematical genomics, epigenetics and sequencing; understanding of the genomics of key biological systems concentrating on fertility, mammary function and the intestine, and tackling focused breeding goals including meat quality, reduced incidence of zoonotic infection and improved animal well-being. SABRE will integrate and build upon the expertise, resources and significant co-funding contributions of 33 of Europe's key research and industry centres in the field of animal production and breeding. The results of this 'cutting-edge' project will be identified genetic variation in key livestock traits together with the tools and knowledge necessary to use this variation in sustainable selective breeding strategies in a wide range of production systems. These new breeding strategies will help industry improve animal health and welfare, adopt lower chemical and energy inputs, reduce livestock waste and pollution,produce safer and better quality foods whilst maintaining biodiversity and economic sustainability.

Jasmonic acid (JA) is a plant hormone with key roles in defence against pests and pathogens. We have recently found that treating seed with JA prior to germination provides enhanced, long-lasting resistance to herbivores and fungal pathogens for periods of at least 8-10 weeks. Moreover, we have found that a second priming agent, beta-aminobutyric acid (BABA), also functions as a resistance-inducing seed treatment. Here, we will investigate the mechanism behind these effects using a multidisciplinary approach. The project will test hypotheses relating to gene expression, epigenetics-related effects, volatile emission, pathogen resistance and multitrophic interactions with insects to establish the science underpinning the phenomenon. We hypothesise that long-lasting induced resistance after seed treatment is based on priming of defence, which mediates a faster and/or stronger defence induction upon subsequent biotic attack. Experimental approaches, using control and seed-treated plants before and after pest attack, will comprise (i) gene transcript profiling, (ii) chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (iii) DNA methylation assays (iv) analysis of volatile emissions and (v) insect bioassays. We will determine impacts of JA and BABA seed treatments on direct defences against red spider mite (Tetranychus urticae). Impacts on indirect defences against herbivores (tritrophic interactions) will be studied with the predatory mite of T. urticae (Phytoseiulus persimilis). Effects on tomato resistance to the biotrophic fungus powdery mildew (Leveillula taurica) will also be explored. Using these systems, we will test the ability of JA and BABA seed treatments to work individually and in combination to improve biotic stress resistance and plant defence.

Diet and lifestyle factors are thought to alter the epigenetic profile of normal cells in a way which predisposes to the development of cancer. We hypothesise that the epigenetic status of normal systemic cells is predictive of breast cancer risk and that epigenetic status is influenced by diet and lifestyle. This hypothesis will be tested in a breast cancer case-control study of 1,000 women with information on diet, lifestyle, alcohol use, physical activity and clinical status. Epigenetic status will be measured in buccal cells using a genome wide scan of 25,000 promoter regions in 60 cases and 60 controls with detailed analysis of 16 selected candidate genes in all 1,000 subjects by pyrosequencing. We will determine; 1) whether the epigenetic status of healthy systemic cells is predictive of breast cancer risk, 2) which genes are epigenetically altered; 3) which lifestyle factors (e.g. diet, physical activity, BMI) are predictive of a 'high breast cancer risk' epigenetic profile?

In addition, HIRA has other H3.3-mediated roles in nuclear reprogramming and maintenance of genome integrity. We have defined a requirement for HIRA in cardiovascular progenitor cells during heart development, although it appears dispensable for the neural crest and endothelial cell contributions to cardiovascular morphogenesis. In this project we explore the genetic network downstream of HIRA-H3.3 in cardiogenic mesoderm. We found that, in embryonic mouse hearts, HIRA interacts with WHSC1, the protein haploinsufficient with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, a human birth defect where approximately half the patients have a congenital heart defect. Therefore, the function of HIRA in co-regulating WHSC1-NKX2.5 targets will be investigated. As a replication-independent chaperone we hypothesis HIRA will have a role in maintaining gene expression profiles in post-replicative (e.g. aging) cardiomyocytes and will test this using our conditional mouse model. The overall aim is to further our understanding of the epigenetics of heart development, and in particular the role of variant histones, which is hitherto unexplored in this context.

Up to 5% of T2D patients have dominantly inherited maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), characterized by beta-cell dysfunction. Elucidating the genetics of familial early-onset T2D, using Whole-Exome Sequencing (WES) can bring breakthroughs in understanding insulin secretion physiology. DNA methylation, particularly in insulin sensitive tissues may also contribute to T2D. Newly-developed genome-wide methylation arrays can be used to identify associations with these epigenetic elements and T2D. In the proposed project, GEPIDIAB, I will take advantage of our MODY family DNA collection and multi-tissue biobank to 1: identify novel genetic causes of familial T2D (WP1) and 2: identify DNA methylation variation associated with T2D (WP2). In WP1, unresolved MODY-X families will be studied using WES to identify novel sequence changes. Then we will elucidate the cellular and metabolic mechanisms leading to beta-cell dysfunction caused by these novel mutations. In WP2, variation in DNA methylation at 450K sites across the genome will be studied in normoglycemic or diabetic bariatric surgery patients. Five separate tissue samples will be studied to identify tissue-specific variation, individual-specific variation and that which varies between cases and controls. We will explore whether there are T2D-specific patterns of methylation that are distinct from those in lean or obese normoglycemic subjects using bisulfite-whole genome sequencing. Overall, we will identify genome-wide methylation patterns that are cell and tissue-specific and disease-specific for five main tissues important in T2D. Together, genetics and epigenetics will complement each other to give a deeper understanding of both insulin deficiency and resistance.	European Research Council	Advanced Grant	2476325.0	EUR

An alternative, but poorly characterised, potential source of human variation is ?epigenetic? in nature and involves stable changes in the marks and signals that influence local gene activity. DNA methylation is known to inhibit gene expression, especially when the promoter concerned lies within a CpG island. CpG islands are predominantly unmethylated, but recent data shows that thousands become methylated in normal tissues and there is some evidence for variation between individuals. The present proposal seeks to characterise the extent of inter-individual variation in methylation of the complete human complement of 25,000 CpG islands. We will look for correlations of CpG island methylation with age, sex, and disease status in an attempt to assess the potential impact of epigenetic variability on health.

43	Professor Catharine West	University of Manchester	None	2014-08-01	2018-07-31	CRUK/14/030 Radiogenomics: Assessment of Polymorphisms for Predicting the Effects of Radiotherapy (RAPPER)-3	Background: ~90,000 cancer patients undergo potentially-curative radiotherapy in the UK every year; there are ~2 million cancer survivors in the UK, a figure risking by 3% a year; ~50% of all cancer survivors received radiotherapy. Radiotherapy toxicity is dose-limiting and impairs quality-of-life in long-term survivors. Modern radiotherapy techniques improve outcomes but future gains require biological optimisation - information on radiosensitivity being particularly useful. Radiosensitivity is a complex, polygenic, heritable trait. Rare mutations (e.g. in ATM) have large effects but most of the variation in radiosensitivity is attributed to common genetic variants (mostly single nucleotide polymorphisms - SNPs) each conferring small, but together clinically exploitable, effects. SNPs are identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Our GWAS in RAPPER prostate and breast patients (n~1,800) showed the strongest SNP associations were with prostate cancer toxicity endpoints rather than an overall toxicity measure. Meta-analysis of four prostate GWAS (n~1,600) revealed many SNP associations, some reaching genome-wide-appropriate statistical significance. More will be significant in larger studies and we can calculate the study size needed to identify them. Aims: RAPPER-3 aims to continue the collection of bloods from radiotherapy patients to provide a resource to underpin translational research where germline DNA data can be linked with radiotherapy toxicity. The resource could also be used in studies linking genotype with cancer predisposition, tumour characteristics and survival. Other types of genetic variation including epigenetic could be studied. Methods: The focus is on prostate cancer but other cancers are included to establish cohorts for future research. The established sample collection (n~5,200) will be increased to 10,000 with ~100 samples collected a month for 4 years. RAPPER-associated trials collect information on toxicity (including pre-treatment), radiation doses and volumes, treatment (use of surgery, hormones, chemotherapy). Additional information is collected at blood collection (ethnicity, age, height, weight, co-morbidity, smoking). New trials will be supported as required. Prospective DNA extraction will ensure the resource is easily available for use in new proposals. In future research, a 10,000 cohort has high power to detect 10 SNPs for clinically-useful risk discrimination. Use for research: (1) develop a SNP profile for radiotherapy individualisation to improve cancer control and reduce toxicity; (2) increase understanding of toxicity pathogenesis to underpin future research identifying potential targets for prevention/mitigation of risk; (3) contribute to collaborative GWAS on multiple cancers/traits including (in the future) risk of second cancers; (4) identify other types of genetic variants using next generation sequencing and/or epigenetics.

This will give insights into the processes that enable these organisms to enter a quiescent state that protects them from both immunological and chemotherapeutic intervention, and also provide novel targets against which to develop new drugs. Specifically, we aim to characterise the range and extent of post-translational modifications to proteins (specifically histones) involved in chromatin formation in Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania infantum and L. mexicana cells undergoing passage through the life cycle and in response to metabolic pertubations. This will involve the isolation of chromatin from different parasite lifecycle stages, and isolation of the individual proteins of the complex (using immunopreciptation methodologies with antibodies specific for the trypanosomatid histones, and BioID approaches to identify neighbouring members of the complex). Proteomic approaches will determine the repertoire of proteins involved. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) on individual proteins will be assessed using specific antibodies and also mass spectrometry of digested proteins to seek mass changes consistent with different PTMs. The abundance of individual metabolites in cells at different cell/lifecycle stages will be determined using LC-MS based untargeted metabolomics. CRISPR/cas9 approaches will allow rapid knockout of non-essential enzymes producing metabolites implicated in PTM, and use of different metabolic substrates will also be used to modulate their abundance to asses impact on epigenetic change and gene transcription by RNAseq. Cell culture techniques will assess life cycle progression in mutants	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	856228.0	GBP
45	Professor Bryan Turner	University of Birmingham	Medical Sciences - Medicine	2004-11-01	2008-03-31	Epigenetics of heterochromatin formation and gene silencing in human embryonic stem cells	Human Embryonic Stem Cells (HESC) can be directed to progress down specific pathways of differentiation, and thereby generate cells committed to defined lineages. Such cells are potentially capable of repairing or replacing damaged tissue when transplanted into patients. As in all other living systems, the progression of HESC down pathways of differentiation is driven by changing patterns of gene expression. These genetic events are regulated by epigenetic mechanisms that switch defined genes on and off at particular stages, and also maintain the on and off states through successive cell generations. In higher eukaryotes, both switching and maintenance mechanisms are profoundly influenced by the packaging of DNA into the cell nucleus as chromatin. It is now clear that chromatin, and hence gene expression, can be altered in complex and subtle ways through the actions of an ever increasing number of enzymes, some of which modify the major DNA packaging proteins, and some of which modify DNA itself. An improved understanding of these fundamental epigenetic events is the central aim of the present proposal, and is an essential first step in fully exploiting the scientific and therapeutic potential of HESC. The project has four specific aims: (i) To establish and characterise new HESC lines using blastocysts from the Assisted Conception Unit at Birmingham Womens? Hospital NHS Trust. (ii) To determine the patterns of histone modification that mark specific genes (autosomal and X-linked) and chromosome domains in the cells of the Inner Cell Mass and how these modifications change in HESC, both before and after differentiation in culture. We will use antibody-based approaches pioneered in the Birmingham lab, primarily Indirect ImmunoFluorescence (IIF) microscopy of metaphase chromosomes and Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation (ChIP). By comparing our results with data from the Human Genome project on the distribution of genes across chromosomes, we can build up a detailed picture of the epigenetic marks carried by particular genomic regions at different stages of development and differentiation. (iii) To elucidate the sequence of epigenetic events that specifies long-term transcriptional silencing of female X-linked genes and the maturation of constitutive heterochromatin during differentiation of HESC. This will be achieved using the same antibody-based approaches as ii. (iv) To identify enzymes responsible for histone modifications on Xi by studying their genomic localisation and by developing procedures, applicable to HESC, for their down-regulation by RNAi.

We will expand, and further characterise the genetic and epigenetic changes in our panel of colorectal cancer derived cell lines, including the use of whole genome micro-array gene expression technology. We will further investigate CDX1 and 2, as well as SFRP and CEA expression, and their control by promoter methylation and demethylation especially in adenomas and intestinal metaplasias. Primary tumour tissue will be used for clinical validation of the changes found in the cell lines. Studies on the distinctive anti CEA antibody, PR1A3, its ADCC activity and the use of a Min/CEA preclinical model will be pursued. Our approaches to the detection of rare tumour cells in blood and other tissues as a basis for early diagnosis, in collaboration with the company Ikonisys and using their automated scanning microscope, will be further developed. We will expand the search for rare variants in candidate genes as a basis for inherited susceptibility to multiple colorectal adenomas and other tumours, and also continue our general population studies.

Our studies will bring together four different programmes of LLHW research. Our major mechanistic research programmes focus on mitochondrial and inflammatory ageing mechanisms which will combine well with our on-going interventions programmes in physical activity/exercise and nutrition. To ensure the cross-disciplinary nature of the LLHW Centre, five core activities have been identified which are specifically designed to facilitate extensive interaction between the four scientific programmes of investigation. Core activity 1: Interventions in animal models: development, optimisation and use of exercise/physical activity and nutrition interventions in appropriate mouse models Core activity 2: Human and mouse tissue resource: collection, storage and processing of human and animal tissues from the intervention studies for use in mechanistic investigations Core activity 3: Epigenetics and transcriptomics: we hypothesise that many of the consequences of both mitochondrial and inflammatory ageing, and their modulation by specific lifestyle interventions, will be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms and associated changes in patterns of gene expression. Core activity 4: Capacity building for future LLHW research: key staff appointments and capacity building PhD and post-doctoral training programmes which will be strictly cross-disciplinary in design, involving both the intervention studies and mechanistic investigations. Core activity 5: Public and policy engagement: ensuring impact for our research is dependent not only upon high quality publications but also increasingly on engaging with public and policy makers.

50	Dr Roderick	Babraham Institute	None	None	None	BBSRC DTG Studentship: Foetal programming of cardiac health	The amount of nutrition that the foetus experiences whilst in the womb (in utero) influences how it makes use of the food it receives as an adult. This is particularly important for a foetus that has been nutritionally deprived in utero, which, as a result of too much nutrition after birth develops diseases, including diabetes and high blood pressure. It has been hypothesised that this adaptive response of the organism to experience in utero is determined by changes in the expression levels of certain genes (the copying of information form DNA to RNA then often into protein). As the DNA complement of an organism cannot be changed, this alteration in gene expression is achieved by modifications of the proteins that control the structure of the DNA; i.e. Epigenetic modifications. So far, it is not known whether this foetal programming of adult health affects how the heart grows in response to increased workload or whether there is an increased risk of heart failure. In addition, it is not known if gene expression in the heart is controlled by epigenetic modifications to the DNA generated in utero. In this study, we will investigate whether rats that have been nutritionally deprived in utero are at a greater risk of developing hypertrophy (an increase in cell size without increase in cell number) and whether their myocytes (muscle cells) are more likely to undergo hypertrophic growth following exposure to a particular stress. We will then determine whether epigenetics plays a role in controlling whether nutritional experience in utero impacts upon future cardiac health.

Reclassification of NDs is therefore urgently needed. From a therapeutic perspective, reclassification should be based on causal and druggable factors. BRAIN-MEND will reclassify existing phenotypes using pathway and network analyses within and across complex NDs including Alzheimer Disease, Parkinson Disease, ALS, FTD, Corticobasal Degeneration, MSA, and PSP. We will use three innovative approaches, pioneered or adopted by the consortium: WP1 will apply the latest methods to identify causal genetic factors acting on molecular pathways; WP2 will apply cutting edge methods to identify epigenetic factors associated with molecular pathways of ND; and WP3 will identify drug targets from network analyses using results from WP1 and WP2 without requiring prior knowledge of mechanism. WP4 will use analysis of medical literature and patient records to identify novel or under-recognized clusters of related clinical features. These complementary approaches allow for iterative cross-validation of elucidated factors by WP1-4. BRAIN-MEND will reclassify ND phenotypes based on biologically meaningful categories corresponding to subgroups (heterogeneity) and common pathways (pleiotropy) to enhance disease understanding and facilitate drug development across the entire complex ND landscape. WP5 will manage the project and disseminate results. Patients and caregivers will be intimately involved throughout the project. Our consortium is highly qualified to perform the work proposed, as evidenced by a mean PI h-index of 61, major impact in research in neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatry, direct expertise with and access to a large and rich dataset spanning all complex NDs, track record in cross disorder analyses, and the related tools, biobanks and cell models needed.

These ongoing efforts have led to numerous insights. In particular, even tumours of similar histological origin and classification harbour variable numbers and types of mutational signatures, revealing an unanticipated level of genetic heterogeneity. This has fundamentally altered cancer therapeutic strategies, patient diagnosis and prognosis, and clinical trial design. However, a widely-assumed, yet to date not experimentally well-tested, hypothesis is that human cancer genome sequences must in part be shaped by the starting tissue's regulatory architectures, including open chromatin, transcriptional regulator binding, replication timing, and polymerase binding. There is correlative evidence at the megabase scale that certain epigenetic features may influence the mutagenic landscape of cancer. This award will fund a series of large-scale experiments to map at high resolution the starting landscape and eventual cancer genomes from a representative somatic tissue in a model organism.We expect this set of experiments will provide insight into the regulatory features that help direct the pathways and functional consequences of genome evolution during carcinogenesis.

54	Professor Simon Langley-Evans	Nottingham, University of	School of Biosciences	None	2017-03-31	Early life programming of the insulin-signalling pathway by maternal obesity	Undernutrition during fetal life is associated with programming of metabolic function, type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Evidence is mounting that maternal obesity is also a risk for adverse programming. However, exploration of the mechanistic basis of programming is challenging, as animal models of obesity generally use hypercaloric diets based upon a narrow range of pure fats or sugars. These may have effects independently of maternal body composition. A cafeteria diet (a varying panel of highly palatable foods) is known to have a programming effect on glucose homeostasis in rodents, through epigenetic modification and altered expression of the insulin-signalling pathway. This project will utilize an established rat model of cafeteria feeding to investigate tissue sensitivity of such effects and the role of epigenetics in programming the insulin-signalling pathway. The relative contributions of maternal obesity and over-feeding to establishing metabolic and cardiovascular phenotypes will be dissected through cross-fostering and staged feeding experiments.

Mothers are exposed to very high levels of placental hormones during pregnancy. Data from animal models suggest that these hormones are important for maternal behaviour. Several imprinted genes regulate the endocrine compartment of the placenta suggesting a role for placental epigenetics in maternal behaviour. We will examine maternal behaviour in an animal model in which the endocrine compartment of the placenta is compromised by genetically altered expression of an imprinted gene. In preliminary work, we find that wild type females change their behaviour towards their pups and show altered brain gene expression in response to our placental mutation. Concurrently, we will undertake a study examining the expression of imprinted genes and hormones in term placenta from women assessed for symptoms of depression (Edinburgh Depression Scale) and anxiety (Spielberger State/Trait Index) before and immediately after delivery. We will initially apply targeted RNAseq and pyrosequencing to a set of discovery placental samples representing extreme moods to obtain further evidence that imprinted genes and placental hormones are aberrantly expressed. Our pilot data identified significantly altered placental expression of an imprinted gene and placental lactogen associated with prenatal depression. Finally, we will bring these two projects together to test the function of the most promising candidate gene identified in our human study in the experimental protocol established using our current animal model. At the end of this study we will have a list of gene changes associated with maternal mood disorders and experimental evidence that these play a causal role.

This project is concerned with the question of why painful conditions should persist over many years, despite the fact that the initial injury or disease has remitted. It is a phenomenon commonly observed in the clinic, where patients might for instance be plagued by back pain long after the initial sports injury healed. What is known is that their nervous system appears to have adopted a permanent maladaptive state as a result of an initial condition. What is unknown is what molecular mechanisms enable this maladaptive state to persist over long periods of time. This project investigates the novel hypothesis that the emergence of latent enhancers permanently alters the phenotype of the neurons and immune cells involved in nociception - ultimately turning acute pain into a lasting chronic condition. Latent enhancers are regulatory regions that emerge in the genome as a result of stimulation once cell development is complete. They have been shown to occur in immune cells, and I have recently been able to observe their appearance in mouse microglia in a model of chronic pain (Denk et al, Cell Reports, 2016). Based on this work, this proposal aims to answer the following three questions: 1. Do latent enhancers also emerge in neurons, where nociception ultimately takes place? 2. Do latent enhancers display characteristics that would allow them to act as a molecular memory? 3. Does the deposition of latent enhancers have functional consequences? Enhancer profiles ultimately determine cell identity, and post-developmental changes to these profiles could therefore affect cell function in the long term. The results of this work would help elucidate the origins of chronic pain, ultimately facilitating the search for effective prevention or treatment. They would also help uncover generic mechanisms of how the environment can impact gene function in a cell-type specific manner.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	447885.0	GBP
57	Professor Richard Shaw	University of Liverpool	None	2018-01-01	2023-06-30	SAVER - Sodium Valproate for Epigenetic Reprogramming in the Management of High Risk Oral Epithelial Dysplasia	Proof of Concept:A recent large epidemiological study showed that long-term use of the antiepileptic agent sodium valproate (SV) reduces the incidence of head and neck cancer in high-risk patients. SV is known to inhibit histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity which may explain the putative chemopreventative effect. HDAC inhibitors are licenced for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and importantly another epigenetic modulator azacytidine is used to prevent malignant transformation of high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. Animal models also support a role for HDACi in cancer prevention activity. Finally epigenetic changes have a proven central role in oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) and its progression to carcinoma. Hypothesis: SV will reduce the rate of malignant transformation in patients with high risk OED through epigenetic modifications.Aims:1) To establish clinical activity of SV as chemopreventive therapy in high-risk OED.2) To explore the hypothesis that SV reduces progression through epigenetic reprogramming.3) To investigate the feasibility and acceptability of a phase III randomised controlled trial of SV chemoprevention. Design:Randomised (2 SV: 1 Placebo) double-blind placebo controlled phase II clinical trial.Population:Patients with OED at high risk of progression to carcinoma (malignant transformation) who have a standard of care therapeutic plan for either close surveillance or surgical resection (patients on either pathway may be recruited).Interventions:Treatment arm: Sodium Valproate 1000mg/dayControl arm: PlaceboOutcomes & Assessments:1) Clinical histological and molecular activity measured using a previously established surrogate composite endpoint which combines changes in:a. Clinical appearance (dimension)b. Histological grade of dysplasiac. Allelic imbalance (3p14 9p21 17p13)This primary endpoint is measured before and after a 4-month of SV or placebo treatment.2) Mechanistic endpoints will explore the hypothesised epigenetic mechanism of action: histone acetylation in circulating white cells and corresponding tissue specific changes in pre- and post- treatment biopsies of the oral lesions. Additionally expression of gene targets in a tissue- & disease-specific panel will be assessed by mRNA transcriptional profiling (Nanostring). DNA promoter methylation most strongly linked with OED malignant progression (P16 DCC EDNRB) will also be studied while downstream effects on proliferation apoptosis and senescence will be assessed by IHC. 3) Feasibility: rates of recruitment screening:randomisation drop-out completion of treatment toxicity. An embedded qualitative study with a purposively selected sample of patients including topic-guided face-to-face semi-structured interviews will focus on patients’ accounts. Sample Size and Analysis:Randomised phase II design based on exact binomial probabilities allowing for unequal allocation ratios: 110 patients randomised 2:1 SV: Placebo assuming 10% dropout.The primary endpoint is response rate using a composite end-point (clinical/pathology/molecular). Analyses shall be carried out assuming a binary response rate with further ordinal modelling carried out should the data allow. Feasibility shall be assessed based on the ability of the study to meet recruitment targets.Economic benefit: reduction in malignant transformation of OED will outweigh the modest costs of SV.

58	Dr Rakyan	Queen Mary, University of London	None	None	2023-06-30	A systems-level study of the role of epigenetics in mediating in utero environmental influences on genome function and transgenerational effects	Understanding the determinants of phenotypic variation remains one of biology's principal challenges. In addition to genetic variation and post-natal environment, it is becoming clear that the in utero environment also influences adult phenotypes, a phenomenon also known as developmental programming. But what are the molecular mechanisms that underlie developmental programming? Several lines of evidence suggest that the 'memory' of the in utero environment resides in epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone modifications. These modifications are involved in many aspects of genome function, including regulation of transcription. A number of small-scale studies have shown that an adverse in utero environmental influence, such as low protein, induces aberrant epigenetic changes in the foetus. These changes are propagated throughout the life of the individual, influencing phenotypic outcomes in the adult. However, we are only beginning to understand how epigenetic mechanisms mediate the effects of developmental programming, and two of the most important questions remain unanswered: (i) What are the quantitative/qualitative changes in the epigenetic landscape as a result of developmental programming (ii) Are these changes transmitted to future generations? It is critical that we now aim to provide an unbiased systems- level understanding of the molecular events associated with developmental programming. I would like to use whole- genome, systems-based approaches to elucidate the epigenetic basis of developmental programming in a mouse model of maternal low protein (LP). The LP model has been extensively studied, as it is relevant to human populations who consume low protein diets for economic or cultural reasons, and shown to have wide-ranging physiological effects, including epigenetic perturbations. It is therefore a useful model for understanding some of the fundamental epigenetic mechanisms associated with developmental programming.

Notwithstanding a few exemplars, the clinical aspirations arising from this biological limit have led to a plethora of largely repetitive empirical trials with weak outcomes overall, little proven impact on myocyte formation and, typically, weak scientific underpinnings. The need is unequivocal for better, deeper, more systematic knowledge?including genomic, post-genomic and functional characterization of relevant cardiopoietic cells, if a step change is ever to occur in progress towards cardiac regeneration as a workable clinical goal. Inherently, the problem requires a team-based or consortium approach, as is sought by the present MRC-BHF call.

Members of the proposed Cardiovascular Stem Cell Research Strategic Development Grant include key experts in mouse genetics, genomics and epigenetics, focused collectively on a series of essential fundamental problems: (1) fate-mapping to define the embryological origin of cardiac progenitor cells and their subsequent contribution to the heart in health and disease; (2) sirtuins and insulin-like growth factor-1 as epigenetic modulators of cardiac repair; (3) chromatin profiling and epigenetic reprogramming of cardiac progenitor cells; (4) high-throughput high-content analyses of cardiac progenitor cell differentiation and function; and (5) next-generation genomics for gene, pathway and chromatin studies in cardiac progenitor cells. A 6,0000 m2 Cardiovascular Research Centre is under construction at Imperial?s Hammersmith campus, adjacent to expanded MRC facilities, and a highly robust recruitment drive is already underway. Apart from the specific questions to be addressed, the overriding goal of this proposal is alignment, integration and capacity-building, establishing an internationally competitive cardiovascular stem cell community that would help lead UK science in this realm and warrant a full-scale Centre in three years? time.

Recent technological advances have facilitated the large scale generation of longitudinal epigenetic data, and there is a need to develop statistical tools for use in this field. There are three main motivations for analyses of epigenetic changes over time: to identify areas of methylation which are more/less stable over time; to examine how exposures (e.g. environmental exposures, or behaviours such as smoking) are associated with the epigenetic changes; and to investigate the potential health consequences of epigenetic changes. Analyses are complicated by the high-dimensionality of the epigenetic space and correlation within CpG regions. We will develop multilevel and mixture methods for more robust analysis of dynamic epigenetic data. We will use MLMs to identify sites and regions which vary over time. We will compare three ways of pre-analysis dimension reduction, including extending DPPCA for application to epigenetic data. We will develop multivariate MLMs for modelling epigenetic change at several sites with respect to exposure/outcome. Current GGMM and Bayesian Mixture Models will be extended and used to derive latent classes of change across several CpG sites, and to identify the small number of CpG sites with evidence of effects which change over time. We will then develop methods to assess whether genetic variation changes over time, for example are specific to particular developmental stages. Power and performance of all methods under a range of study designs will be compared, using simulations. Data from ALSPAC and other longitudinal studies available to the co-applicants, will be used to benchmark our methods and conclusions. These data will be from 450k and bisulphite sequencing datasets, but the methods will be applicable to any application with a large number of correlated measurements.

The incidence of one of the commonest types of renal disease (in adults and children), idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS), appears considerably higher in LMICs than in the developed world. This is likely contributed to by a combination of infectious triggers and genetic background, though other factors remain unknown. The biological understanding of glomerular disease has been revolutionised recently by study of the glomerular podocyte, the target cell in INS, alongside significant genetic advances. The field is ripe for translational research on wider patient cohorts to exploit compelling biological hypotheses arising from this work. This proposal brings together researchers with complementary strengths, and will enable knowledge transfer between all partners. The host laboratory in the UK is a world leader in podocyte biology and INS population genetics, and has well-established links with key leaders in nephrology in several LMICs. In the UK we established a national renal patient registry (www.rarerenal.org) and biorepository, with widespread clinician and patient buy-in that is recognised as innovative. We propose to extend this concept internationally, to build a vibrant and cohesive network of academic centre leads in three LMICs with the UK centre as a hub. The downstream benefits will be (i) establish a team of LMIC centres consistently trained in laboratory research/diagnostic techniques and clinical database/biobank establishment (ii) a pipeline to transfer cutting edge translational biology advances from the UK laboratory (and elsewhere) to establish novel biomarker assays locally (iii) share clinical trials methodology that will maximise impact of biomarker findings in large cohorts of patients. Links to Bristol will facilitate definitive studies on genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenetics in this carefully phenotyped population, with on going sustainable skills development	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	532742.0	GBP

Despite concerted public health campaigns, in some cases over several decades, the prevalence of unhealthy lifestyle behaviours remains high, and in many cases is strongly socially patterned, contributing substantially to health inequalities. Understanding the developmental trajectories of, and pathways into, these behaviours is therefore necessary if we are to develop new interventions, in order to improve individual and public health, and reduce associated personal and societal harms. In addition, although some of the negative health and mental health consequences of these behaviours are known, many are not, or remain controversial. A more complete understanding of the consequences of these behaviours will also inform public health campaigns and other interventions. This programme will focus initially on tobacco and alcohol use, as two of the largest contributors to morbidity and premature mortality in developed countries, and extend this work into other health behaviours (e.g., caffeine use, overeating and obesity, exercise). The work will proceed along three parallel workstreams, to address three primary aims: 1) to understand the developmental trajectories and determinants of health behaviours; 2) to conduct causal analyses of the causes and consequences of health behaviours; and 3) to develop interventions to modify health behaviours in adolescence and adulthood. This work will be integrated across the other programmes within the MRC University of Bristol Integrative Epidemiology (IEU) Unit, making use of methodological developments in Mendelian randomization (including the use of allelic risk scores), epigenetics, and recall-by-genotype methods, as well as conventional epidemiological and experimental methods. Ultimately, we aim to provide a much more detailed understanding of the factors that lead to unhealthy lifestyle behaviours, and clarify the impact of these behavioural on physical and mental health where this remains uncertain. This, in turn, will enable us to develop interventions to modify health behaviours at an individual and population level.	Medical Research Council	Unit	None	None

Subsequently, I will replicate/validate my findings in an independent set of GDM samples (N=200/800). Association testing will be carried out by fitting probe-wise linear models, with adjustments for biological and technical confounders (control probe principal components). The relevance of DNA methylation hits can be tested by robust pathway enrichment tests of genes associated with the differentially methylated CpG sites with functional ontologies using custom developed scripts that adjust for probe coverage bias (goseq). Overlaying relevant Roadmap Epigenome data by performing permutation tests utilizing random sampling of matched CpG sites. I expect this work to identify specific DNA methylation sites, with a detectable and predominant association with GDM. In the later stages of the fellowship, I will lead the experimental design for the methylation experiments by performing large-scale epigenome-wide association scans. This will include detecting associations of IUGR/SGA with methylation by using cases and controls recruited at delivery (N=600/600) and finding methylation marker associated with foetal growth in a longitudinal study (N~2,500) with multiple anthropometric measurements throughout pregnancy. The multi-ethnic design of this study will also allow me to establish transethnic effects. Lastly, I will be utilizing genetic variants as instrumental variables in two-step Mendelian Randomization to determine whether epigenetic markers are in causal pathways downstream to intra-uterine events.

Heritable variation was traditionally thought to occur exclusively as a result of DNA sequence polymorphisms, but it is now clear that a significant portion of heritable variation occurs by other means, among which epigenetic processes appear to play a major role (Madlung and Comai, 2004; Richards, 2006; Richards, 2008; Bossdorf et al., 2008). Understanding the degree of epigenetic diversity and its influence on the relationship between environment, genotype and phenotype should improve our ability to predict the effect of environmental changes on performance and potential of plants and their progeny. To reach this goal this project aims to: • quantify the amount of epigenetic variation that occurs as a result of DNA sequence polymorphisms, and identify which epigenetic marks are involved, • quantify the amount of epigenetic variation that occurs as a result of environmental variation, and detect which environmental changes and which marks are involved, • investigate the interplay of genetic, epigenetic and environmental variation on phenotype. To date, a major stumbling block in the field has been the sheer complexity of, and the interplay between, the many factors that control the phenotype. We propose to overcome this by integrating methodologies from the fields of both population genetics and classical epigenetics. Specifically, we will extend genome-wide association studies by using whole genome approaches such as sequencing after chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) and after bisulfite conversion (BS-seq) to map the epigenome, and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to investigate the transcriptome. In this approach, a set of Arabidopsis accessions, selected to be both genetically and potentially epigenetically most divergent, will be subject to epigenomic profiling for DNA methylation, histone modifications and nucleosome occupancy. The differences in distribution of chromatin marks between the accessions will then be used as “epi-phenotypes” for genome-wide association mapping. They will also be used as “epi-polymorphisms” for epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). These experiments will be repeated on plants that have been grown for multiple generations under a variety of conditions favoring slow or fast growth, in extreme habitats or under different climatic conditions, nutrition or light regimes. This will enable us to understand the relationship between genetic, environmental and chromatin variation, to address which biotic and abiotic factors induce epigenetic variation, and to explore the link between genetic and epigenetic variation, phenotypic plasticity and environmental adaption. The inheritance of chromatin marks over multiple generations and their effect on phenotype will be used to examine the role of epigenetics in transgenerational memory and environmental adaption.

Transcriptional profiles are directed by the chromatin landscape and 3D structure (‘architecture’), which is affected by the presence of specific combinations and concentrations of transcription factors. The SFB consortium proposes to examine general principles that underlie switches in transcription profiles, such as those that occur in normal and aberrant development, in the reaction to infection and in carcinogenesis. Using JAKSTAT signalling as a paradigm, we propose to test the following key hypotheses. Transcription factors represent indispensable elements in regulating chromatin shape, i.e. they are either pioneer factors in chromatin remodelling and modification, or readers of epigenetic information deposited by other transcription factors. In particular, we hypothesize that homeostatic and dynamic (‘acute stressed’) and constrained (‘chronically stressed’, mutated/cancerous) cellular programmes critically depend on the status of JAKSTAT signalling. Key transcription factors act in concert with different repertoires of associated factors to exert functions that are strictly context-dependent. For STATs and JAKs, we hypothesize that STATs have JAK-dependent and -independent functions and vice versa. We propose that the availability of STATs, their isoforms and their interaction partners determine their role as inducers of chromatin modification or as classical transcription factors. The work will be pursued in haematopoietic cells in the context of STAT1/3/5 and TYK2 activities in immune responses (‘acute/chronic’ stressed landscapes) or malignant transformation (‘constrained’, mutated landscapes). The central aim is to determine at which hierarchical levels JAK-STAT influences cell and organismic homeostasis as well as disease. The expertise of the consortium members ranges from immunity, haematopoietic malignancies and epigenetics to bioinformatics. The SFB has the critical mass to develop and exploit next-generation methodologies, including assays for genome-wide 3D chromatin interactions, chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation states and ChIP-Seq (if necessary combined with mass spectrometry) and deep NGS for various classes of RNA. ‘Disease-tailored’ mouse models and genome editing will be used to translate the findings to disease. Animal experimentation will be approved by an Ethics committee and the national authorities and will strictly follow the 3R principles. The SFB would be hosted by the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna with the participating institutions CeMM Austrian Academy of Sciences, MFPL University of Vienna, Medical University of Vienna and Ludwig Boltzmann Society. The SFB would build on Vienna’s longstanding reputation in the field of JAK-STAT signalling (www.jak-stat.at), extending its scope to address key issues in chromatin function. The results will pave the way for novel therapeutic possibilities, especially with regard to personalized medicine.	Austrian Science Fund FWF	Special Research Programmes SFB	1598520.0	EUR

Prof. Dr. Karl KUCHLER	Medical University of Vienna	None	2018-10-01	2022-09-30	Molecular and Cellular Control of Tissue Homeostasis in Health and Disease - TissueHome	The doc.funds “TissueHome” will implement a new program devoted to the competitive training of 12 PhD students in translational research, addressing fundamental questions related to molecular mechanisms of immune surveillance that maintain tissue homeostasis. A better understanding of molecular principles governing tissue homeostasis in health is needed for efficient therapeutic interventions. However, many questions concerning molecular principles of cell-cell communication, long-range immune signaling, and recruitment of effector cells to ensure normal tissue homeostasis remain open. The central hypothesis of the working program is that malregulation of complex communication signals between immune cells derange the physiological tissue control, thus promoting inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, as well as microbial infections. Thus, TissueHome will decipher how the dynamic communication between innate and adaptive immune cells at epithelial barriers shapes the immunological competence, which is required for protection against infections, autoimmune diseases but also for tolerance to commensal pathogens of the microbiome. TissueHome will address three major questions: (i) How does the dynamic cross-talk of innate–adaptive immunity engage regulatory mechanisms (chromatin modifications / epigenetics, RNA modification, (post)-transcriptional & post-translational) to establish tissue homeostasis in physiology and diseases? (ii) What are the mechanisms innate phagocytes and adaptive T cells use to communicate within microenvironments of epithelia during beneficial/detrimental tissue homeostasis? (iii) How do host-pathogen interactions of microbial pathogens with innate / adaptive immune cells shape the inflammatory response and how can hyperinflammation alter mucosal microbiomes, and how can microbiome dysbiosis promote disease susceptibility? The TissueHome faculty encompasses a team of scientists enjoying international recognition, including leading experts in immune signaling, epigenetics, RNA modification, fungal infectious diseases, autoimmune disesase, molecular medicine, animal genetics, cellular and molecular immunology, host-pathogen interactions, systems biology, gene regulation and bioinformatics. The faculty members have competitive track records in both research and training of PhD students. The TissueHome training will entail state-of-the art methods, including genomic and genetic technologies, next generation sequencing technologies, high-end imaging, animal models and mouse genetics, and immune cell technologies to decipher the molecular mechanisms orchestrating tissue barrier function. The added value of TissueHome is reflected by the integration into the existing MFPL PhD program, with reciprocal benefits due to interdisciplinarity and translational approaches taken by TissueHome, but also by a new and timely topic introduced into the MFPL PhD program. Another added value is that each main aim will be addressed by two to three PhD students through hypothesis-driven collaborative projects. Taken together, TissueHome will (i) offer PhD students to work on interdisciplinarity / translational projects of medical relevance in excellent research environments, (ii) provide a stimulating international environment for research and transferable skills training, and (iii) prepare the PhD students for a successful career in academia, industry or in science-related sectors.

This is a complex process that effectively amplifies incoming signals to prevent further damage while the body is repairing. These changes are supported by specific patterns of gene expression that are dynamic and evolve with time. Sometimes the pain persists after the injury has resolved and becomes a chronic pain state indicating maintained sensitization of spinal cord nociceptive networks. Could this be due to aberrant epigenetic modifications? Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and chromatin remodelling regulate high-order chromatin structure crucial to the regulation of gene expression. Epigenetic processes imprint environmental experiences such as social interactions onto the fixed genome and therefore provide a bridge between the genes and the environment by refining neural networks according to experience. These processes are dynamic and reversible but can also result in stable alterations. Their de-regulation has been associated with a broad spectrum of neurological disorders. I will investigate the epigenetic processes that contribute to gene repression and activation in dorsal horn neurons in a model of joint inflammation. 1) DNA methylation is known to inhibit gene transcription. I will investigate DNA methylation status of a small number of genes previously identified. 2) Post-translational modifications of histone proteins, specifically at residues known to modify neuronal network function, regulate access to DNA. These modifications will be mapped onto nociceptive pathways during different phases of joint inflammation. 3) Descending controls from the brain and early life injury modulate pain behaviour. I will look at how descending controls and early life injury can regulate DNA methylation and histone modifications and I will investigate the correlation between epigenetic changes and pain behaviour. 4) Finally, to strengthen this correlation, I will modulate the expression of selected genes under epigenetic controls during joint inflammation and analyse their contribution to the pain state. This will include the investigation of micro-RNAs predicted by gene expression analysis and thought to fine tune neural circuits. This investigation will provide insights into the complex roles of epigenetics in central nervous system plasticity and set the stage for a deeper understanding of the molecular changes that contribute to chronic pain, an area of immense unmet clinical needs.

What we lack is an understanding of the underlying genetic mechanism and with it, the best model to explain the processes at work. Here we focus on discovering the genetic mechanisms underlying the host-parasite interactions because this knowledge will allow us to identify the model to best explain coevolution. The two most often discussed models are time lacked negative frequency dependent selection (the Red Queen hypothesis) and coevolution by selective sweeps. Knowing the genetics would allow us to pinpoint the appropriate coevolutionary model.The Pasteuria-Daphnia modelPasteruia ramosa is an endoparasitic bacterium infecting several Daphnia species as well as some other Cladocera. Despite of Pasteuria's seemingly low degree of specificity on the host species level, this bacterium shows a remarkable degree of host genotype specificity. The same clone of Pasteuria shows high specificity in infection for only certain clones of D. magna, but is also specific to certain clones of other species, e.g. D. longispina or D. pulex. I am proposing that one Ph.D. student project continues to work on the genetic interactions between Daphnia and parasite clones. The aims of this work would be 1) Conduct multiple crosses between Daphnia clones and elucidate the segregation patterns of resistance. 2) Test for linkage among resistance loci. 3) To determine whether resistance loci show epistasis, i.e., if combinations of alleles result in different phenotypes than their effects alone would suggest. The postdoc project proposed here focuses on the population genetic structure of Pasteuria ramosa. For this we plan to sample Pasteuria from different spatial and temporal scales and obtain sequence data on putative resistance loci and house-keeping genes. This project has three parts: 1) Global scale: With Pasteuria samples across Europe and North America. 2) Intermediate temporal scale: Using Pasteuria samples from the layered sediments of lakes (sediment cores), we plan to reconstruct the temporal changes of the Pasteuria populations over periods of about 30 years. 3) Short temporal scale: To link the changes in allele frequencies expected from the sediment cores with events during natural selection, we will collect time series of Pasteuria-infected Daphnia during epidemics in natural populations. These data will allow us to follow the microevolutionary changes during coevolution and to quantify the strength of selection acting on candidate genes. The Octosporea-Daphnia modelOctosporea bayeri is a microsporidian parasite with both vertical and horizontal transmission. Preliminary data suggest, that O. bayeri adapts by means of epigenetic genome modification. The second Ph.D. project for which I seek funding with this proposal is to verify or reject the epigenetics hypothesis for O. bayeri. First we will carry out detailed experiments to test for epigenetic adaptation. If these experiments suggest that epigenetic effects are likely to play a role for parasite adaptation, we will use 'bisulfite sequencing' to obtain methylation patterns of O. bayeri kept in different host environments. This would allow us to find candidate genes responsible for parasite adaptation to its host clones. The topic of parasite adaptation by means of epigenetics has received little attention by evolutionary biologists, but promises an exciting field for understanding host-parasite coevolution.

In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, where the molecular mechanisms are the most detailed, it is believed that small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) guide the RNA-Induced Transcriptional Silencing (RITS) complex to specific chromatin regions to trigger formation of heterochromatin.Although it is clear that siRNAs are required for RITS localization to chromatin, important events of RITS siRNA-dependent recruitment remain to be elucidated. Additionally, critical aspects of the following RITS-driven heterochromatin formation mechanism need to be clarified. Genetic data indicate that among proteins required for assembly of heterochromatin some act very early in this process to the point that they should interact directly or indirectly with RITS. However, no physical connection between RITS and these enzymes has yet been found.This project proposes to address these fundamental aspects of RNAi-mediated heterochromatin assembly in S.pombe, by coupling interdisciplinary and innovative approaches to classical protein affinity purifications, yeast molecular genetics and chromatin techniques. The first part of the project will concentrate on the characterization of an unprecedented physical connection between RITS and a chromatin-modifying activity. In parallel, we propose to develop two complementary approaches to identify new proteins that physically and/or genetically interact with RITS. Finally, thanks to a UV light-induced crosslinking technology, we intend to study RITS recruitment to chromatin by analyzing its direct interaction with nucleic acids both in vitro and in vivo.As the control of chromatin structure by RNAi is evolutionary conserved, our studies have the potential to bring general insights into how RNAi-based chromatin modifications take place and are regulated in the kingdom of eukaryotes	European Research Council	Starting Grant	904940.0	EUR
73	Prof. Didier Trono	EPF Lausanne	Laboratoire de virologie et génétique FSV-GHI EPFL	2014-01-01	2016-12-31	Transcriptional control of hematopoietic stem cell renewal and differentiation	This project aims at deciphering the transcriptional networks that control the homeostasis of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and thus govern their delicate oscillation between quiescence, multipotent self-renewal and differentiation. Clas-sic models of hematopoiesis have evoked relatively simple, hierarchical networks involving only a small number of transcription factors (TFs). However, genome-wide studies have now revealed that these networks are much more con-voluted and dynamic than anticipated, hence that elucidating their regulatory logic will be a tremendous challenge. For example, many TFs driving lineage-specific differentiation are already bound to their target genes at the stem cell and progenitor states, a process coined ‘anticipatory DNA binding’ as these targets become induced only after lineage commitment. This suggests repressive mechanisms, where co-repressors interacting with these TFs prevent transcrip-tional activation, thus increasing the flexibility of cell-fate commitment and avoiding a premature loss of HSC multipo-tency. Since this process likely is at the heart of HSC homeostasis and hematopoietic differentiation, we will explore its modalities by focusing on three co-repressors recently found by members of our consortium and others to exert pro-found influences on hematopoietic transcriptional networks: Nuclear receptor Co-Repressor 1 (NCoR1), its paralogue Silencing Mediator of ReTinoic acid (SMRT), and KAP1, the universal cofactor of KRAB-containing zinc finger pro-teins (KRAB-ZFPs). To investigate the quantitative contribution of these co-repressors to HSC gene regulation and to assess their structural and dynamic properties, we will develop and implement innovative and targeted systems-level approaches that cross the boundaries between HSC biology, bio- and micro-engineering, genomics, molecular genetics, proteomics, structural biology, and computational biochemistry. A first subproject led by Matthias Lutolf (ML), a trained engineer and stem cell biologist, will focus on the development of a set of quantitative single-cell assays as tools to analyze the heterogeneity in dynamics of single human HSC fate. These efforts should provide the consortium with a more refined way to assess co-repressor-mediated fate regulation. A second subproject led by Bart Deplancke (BD), a trained bioengineer and expert in genomics and systems biology, will elucidate the molecular involvement of NCoR1 and SMRT in HSC self-renewal and differentiation, specifically through the characterization of the DNA binding and gene regulatory properties of SMRT and NCoR1. We will then integrate these findings with those obtained on KAP1, which will be provided through the third subproject led by Didier Trono (DT), a trained M.D. and expert in virology and epigenetics, to assess the existence of a so-called “co-repressosome” in which multiple co-repressors act together to steer gene expression. Questions regarding the spatial and temporal properties of their employment, their target gene specificity, their impact on the local chromatin state, and how and to which extent they influence gene transcription will be addressed. In addition, experiments in the third subproject will define the molecular role of KRAB/KAP1-mediated regulation on HSC fate and, ultimately, whether polymorphism in this KRAB/KAP1 system underlies inter-individual differences in susceptibility to HSC-related diseases. Directly related, Matteo Dal Peraro (MDP), a trained physicist and expert in structural biology and computational biochemistry, will focus on the underlying structural properties of the KRAB-ZFP and KAISO DNA recognition mode, combined and strengthened by the new functional data. KAP1 and SMRT/NCoR1-based co-repressor complexes will also be explored to enable a structure-based interpretation of the co-repression mechanism in HSC transcriptional networks.This multidisciplinary endeavor will provide an important foundation to model the regulation of dynamic HSC processes, notably shedding light on the influence of stem cell niche factors on their cellular targets, and will more generally foster the development of methodology needed to acquire meaningful data at the single cell level. As such, this effort will not only lead to significant advances in stem cell biology, but will also help optimizing approaches for the ex vivo maintenance and expansion of stem cells, an important gain for broad areas of medicine.

Prof. Dr. Gerda EGGER	Medical University of Vienna	None	2009-02-01	2011-01-31	Epigenetics in NPM-ALK Positive Lymphomas	Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) are a rising group of malignant tumors, with more than 800 new cases in Austria per year. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), a highly malignant T cell NHL, is frequently associated with a genetic translocation generating the NPM-ALK fusion protein. The fusion is highly oncogenic in vitro and in vivo and has been shown to interact with a variety of oncogenic networks. Besides genetic mutations, epigenetic aberrations have been associated with numerous tumors. Silencing of tumor suppressor genes by DNA methylation was shown to be a hallmark of human cancer. A second epigenetic pathway is dependent on the action of Polycomb proteins, which can act as oncogenes. Interestingly, only a limited amount of literature exists on the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in ALCL. Here we propose to analyze the role of epigenetics on the development and progression of NPM-ALK positive lymphomas. We plan to use an integrated approach to study changes in DNA methylation and Polycomb occupancy in human tumor samples, cell lines and in a transgenic mouse model. We will use human tissue arrays to determine the expression status of Polycomb proteins in several NPM-ALK positive and negative lymphoma patient samples. Custom tiling arrays will be used to determine the epigenetic profile of different ALCL cell lines. Furthermore, we plan to use NPM-ALK transgenic mice to elucidate the role of DNA methylation and Polycomb proteins in murine lymphomagenesis and to isolate putative novel targets of epigenetic aberrations. To investigate the biological importance of these aberrations, we will treat human cell lines with specific epigenetic drugs. We will intercross mice with a T-cell specific deletion of Dnmt1 with NPM-ALK transgenic mice to study the effects of DNA hypomethylation on NPM-ALK dependent tumor-formation and -progression. The use of epigenetic drugs, such as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and histone deacetylase inhibitors has been approved by the US food and drug administration for the treatment of specific hematological malignancies, and clinical trials have shown the beneficial effects for several tumor types of tumors. Thus, our study may elucidate novel molecular mechanisms of the disease and provide a rationale for the application of epigenetic drugs to target ALCL.

Our aim is to provide the evidence base that will improve treatment success with IVF and enable stratified and effective antenatal care in IVF and spontaneous conceptions (SC). This is important because up to 40% or pregnancies are affected by one or more of miscarriage, stillbirth, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes, preterm birth or delivery or a small or large for gestational aged infant, but we do not know the best way of preventing these. IVF is now the commonest treatment for infertility with >250K IVF cycles completed per year in the UK and on average 1 in 30 primary school children were born as a result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). Success rates vary by couple and treatment characteristics but are between 20-30%. There are suggestions that IVF per se, and pregnancy complications in IVF and SC have important adverse effects on future offspring cardio-metabolic health, but whether these associations are causal and if so their magnitude is unclear. Our objectives are to accurately predict and identify causal paths for: (i) response to IVF; (ii) healthy pregnancy and perinatal outcomes in IVF and SC; and (iii) offspring cardio-metabolic health. Methods Our focus will primarily be on maternal smoking, physical activity, sleep patterns, adiposity, pregnancy metabolic profiles and fetal (cord-blood) DNA methylation as potential predictors or risk factors. We will use data from detailed clinical and general pregnancy/birth cohorts. We will work with relevant consortia, including the EuroCHILD pan-European birth cohort that we are involved in establishing from 26 existing cohorts, early growth genetics (EGG) consortia, in which we co-lead maternal-offspring genetic analyses, the Genetics of Diabetes In Pregnancy (GENdip) consortia that we have recently developed, and the pregnancy/birth cohorts working group aligned to the Consortia Of METabolomics Studies (COMETS), which we lead, as well as the Pregnancy And Child Epigenetics (PACE) consortia, which we work closely with alongside Relton’s MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit programme. We will triangulate results across the following analytical methods applied to these data sources: multivariable regression (MV), Mendelian randomization (MR), non-genetic instrumental variable (IV) analyses, within sibship and negative control studies. Translation Building on our successful impact on clinical guidelines in the first five-years of this programme, we will continue to work with relevant clinicians, patient groups and NICE guideline developers. For new methodological developments we will provide and share datasets and code and widely disseminate these.	Medical Research Council	Unit	None	None

Silver-Russell Syndrome (SRS) is a distinct subtype of the SGA population with poor fetal and postnatal growth. A proportion of these patients have duplication in the chromosome 11p15 locus which contains the IGF2 gene. This is known to be important in fetal growth with complex control mechanisms for expression including maternal imprinting and multiple promoters. It has recently been demonstrated that up to 30% of all SRS patients have undermethylation in the IGF2/H19 locus with associated reduced IGF2 expression. The hypothesis is that SRS is a result of IGF2 deficiency which is not necessarily secondary to the methylation abnormalities. The aim of the project is look at the methylation status of various differentially methylated regions in the IGF2-H19 locus using EBV transformed lymphocytes taken from patients enrolled in the NESTEGG study and to compare this with IGF2 expression. Methylation status will be examined using bisulphite treatment of DNA in conjunction with either product subcloning and sequencing or with pyrosequencing. IGF2 expression will be quantified using real-time TaqMan assay. An IGF2 ELISA assay will be used to compare protein expression to investigate translation of message. If IGF2 deficiency is more widespread compared to methylation abnormalities, alternative pathogenic mechanisms such as defective promoter function or abnormal histone acetylation and methylation will be investigated. If IGF2 deficiency is shown to be exclusive to those patients with methylation abnormalities, the IGF2 receptor epigenetics and function will be investigated further. Although poor fetal growth is known to have significant effects on cardiovascular risk in adulthood it remains a poorly understood and clinically heterogeneous phenomenon. This project aims to further understand the role that IGF2 and epigenetics may play in poor fetal and postnatal growth.	Medical Research Council	Fellowship	131628.0	GBP
78	Professor Federico Turkheimer	King's College London	Neuroimaging	2011-07-29	2016-07-16	PET Methodology	In the next five years we want to progress the set of technologies that PET Methodology has built at Hammersmith for the field in the past 20 years with the aim of increasing PET accuracy and expand its applications to provide ever more useful end-points for diagnostic use, clinical research and drug development. We will support the introduction of new tracers in the Unit (e.g. 11C-Ro-154513, 11CCUMI, 11C-CNS-5161, 11C-MePPEP) developing tailored quantitative methodologies. We will employ novel modeling approaches (e.g. generalized reference region models) to simplify,without loss of precision, the use of PET in research and drug development. To support the imaging work in Neurodegeneration, we will expand our methodological toolbox on imaging inflammation developing quantification methods for the new generation of high affinity TSPO radiotracers such as 11C-PBR28 and 18F-FEPPA. We will be also looking at translational models of senescence to identify aging microglia phenotypes and their markers. To support the work in Psychiatric disorders, we will develop methodologies able to quantify the dynamics of large neuronal ensembles from fMRI time-courses looking both at local and regional determinants using concepts from network analysis and statistical physics. We will then use these endpoints in combined fMRI/PET study designs to measure the relationship between receptor densities/endogenous neurotransmitters levels (e.g. using dopaminergic tracers such as 18F-FDOPA, 11C-Raclopride, 11C-FLB457 or cannabinoid tracers such as 11C-CB1) and neuronal dynamics. In Cancer, we will work on two paths. On one side we will research novel quantification methodologies for radiotracers used in clinical studies at the Unit (18FFluorothymidine, 18F- AH111585 e 18CCholine) to model their complex and heterogeneous kinetic behavior in tumor cells. In parallel, we will be developing computer aided strategies able to use features of functional (PET) and structural (CT) images to automatically detect tumors in functional or multimodal studies. Our work on Genomics will continue with focus on the epigenetics of brain disorders (Huntington‘s and Parkinson‘s disease, Schizophrenia and bipolar disorders) using computational models applied to microarray data for exploration and guide for further genomic (ChIP-Seq) studies.

A comprehensive understanding of the roles of human proteins in normal and disease biology will be required to develop effective medicines, and this understanding will come only with a functional understanding of each protein. High-quality research tools will be necessary to achieve this understanding, however only a fraction of human proteins have been purified to homogeneity, only 6% of the human proteome is understood at the structural level and there are few potent and selective probes of function to human proteins (i.e. chemical inhibitors or antibodies). Over the past 5 years, we have developed and implemented a structural genomics pipeline to increase significantly the available structural knowledge for human proteins ? targeting proteins of relevance to drug discovery. Our laboratories now consistently produce over 20% of the global output of human protein structures - over 30 % in 2009 - and have purified over 2,000 human proteins in milligram quantities. In the next funding period, we propose to expand the capabilities of our pipeline to tackle more challenging structures, and to exploit the purified proteins and structures to generate a broader and more impactful range of research tools, including high-quality chemical probes and recombinant protein-capture agents. We will again target proteins of relevance to drug discovery, but place particular emphasis on proteins linked to the regulation of epigenetics, an exploding area of biomedical research and a frontier area of drug discovery. These new initiatives will involve novel models for collaboration, in which our industry partners will allocate internal resources (e.g. medicinal chemistry) to the projects, whose goals are to generate reagents that will go into the public domain without restriction on use.

80	Dr. Lucia CLEMENS-DAXINGER	Austrian Academy of Sciences	None	2009-08-17	2011-08-16	Epigenetics and the determination of adult phenotype	Epigenetic modifications to DNA play a crucial role in the determination of the phenotype of an organism by controlling patterns of gene expression. Cytosine methylation and repressive histone modifications are examples of epigenetic modifications that are associated with genes that are transcriptionally inert, while active histone modifications are associated with transcriptional activity. Little is currently known about the rules that determine which parts of the genome acquire which type of modifications. We do know that the different epigenetic states correlate with the locus being active in some cells and inactive in others resulting in a variegated phenotype. This phenomenon can even extend to the whole organism resulting in isogenic individuals with different phenotypes. In some cases these epigenetic states can actually be inherited through meiosis resulting in transgenerational effects (epigenetic inheritance). In the proposed project a forward genetic approach is planned to be used to identify and characterize mutations in genes that are needed for the establishment and maintenance of epigenetic state in the mouse. Epigenetic phenomena such as variegation, variable expressivity and epigenetic inheritance are not understood at a molecular level and the identification of genes involved in the establishment and maintenance of epigenetic marks will be a start to the characterisation of the mechanisms involved.

81	Dr. Isabelle WEINHOFER-MOLISCH	Medical University of Vienna	None	2008-12-01	2010-05-31	Epigenetic profiling	Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic system of transcriptional regulation causing an allele-specific expression of some genes dependent on the parent-of-origin. Genomic imprinting occurs only in mammals and flowering plants and it is generally assumed that imprinted genes play an important role for the distribution of nutrients from the mother to the offspring. Genomic imprinting in flowering plants has long been inferred to play an important role in seed development. However, the mechanism of genomic imprinting in plants is only partially understood and likely involves alterations in DNA and hisone methylation and chromatin structure between the differentially expressed maternal and paternal alleles. Therefore, a central question of this project is to clarify when imprinting marks are established and how are they maintained during endosperm development. We will use state of the art molecular biology techniques to track DNA and histone methylation directly from gametes to different stages of endosperm development, enabling an exploration of the timing of genomic imprinting. Currently, only a small number of imprinted genes have been described in plants. Thus, we will also focus on the identification of new imprinted genes in Arabidopsis. Together, the proposed project will deepen the knowledge of the mechanism of genomic imprinting in plants and will also provide further important insights into the influence of imprinting on seed development. Currently, one of the main focuses of plant research in Vienna (e.g. at the Gregor Mendel Institute) is the epigenetic plasticity of plant genomes in context of gene regulation, chromosome biology and development. Furthermore, epigenetic mechanisms are of substantial interest for medical research as well and are intensively investigated at the Institute of Molecular Pathology in Vienna. Several epigenetic mechanisms are evolutionary conserved, therefore, we expect that the results of the proposed research will not only be of interest to plant scientists but will reveal mechanisms of parent-of-origin dependent gene regulation that are conserved between mammals and flowering plants. Last but not least, imprinted genes play an important role during endosperm development. Endosperm represents mankind's most important renewable resource for food, feed and industrial raw material. Therefore, the proposed research is not merely of academic but potentially also of great economic interest. Thus, the knowledge gained from this innovative research project will be of particular use for the Austrian research done in the field of epigenetics and seed development.

82	Dr Caroline Taylor	University of Bristol	None	2014-07-01	2019-07-31	In utero exposure to heavy metals: effects on child development.	It has recently been recognised that there are effects of heavy metals on babies and children at levels previously thought to have been of no concern. The fetus is particularly vulnerable because of the high rate of cell division and differentiation. Thus, relatively low levels of exposure that do not harm the mother may have a profound effect on the development of the fetus and its growth and development during childhood. This project will make use of data from a prospective birth cohort study: the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. This provides a unique and powerful opportunity to evaluate the long-term outcomes of in utero exposure to Pb, Cd and Hg on children and to enable identification of associations between maternal levels and cognitive and behavioural outcomes in the child. The aims of the study are: (1) to identify the predictors of Pb, Cd and Hg levels in pregnancy with a view to identifying interventions that will minimise exposure; (2) to identify the predic tive value of maternal levels on a variety of childhood educational and developmental outcomes up to age 18 years; (3) to identify the role of maternal genetics and epigenetics in modifying these relationships.

Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), a highly malignant T cell NHL, is frequently associated with a genetic translocation generating the NPM-ALK fusion protein. The fusion is highly oncogenic in vitro and in vivo and has been shown to interact with a variety of oncogenic networks. Besides genetic mutations, epigenetic aberrations have been associated with numerous tumors. Silencing of tumor suppressor genes by DNA methylation was shown to be a hallmark of human cancer. A second epigenetic pathway is dependent on the action of Polycomb proteins, which can act as oncogenes. Interestingly, only a limited amount of literature exists on the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in ALCL. Here we propose to analyze the role of epigenetics on the development and progression of NPM-ALK positive lymphomas. We plan to use an integrated approach to study changes in DNA methylation and Polycomb occupancy in human tumor samples, cell lines and in a transgenic mouse model. We will use human tissue arrays to determine the expression status of Polycomb proteins in several NPM-ALK positive and negative lymphoma patient samples. Custom tiling arrays will be used to determine the epigenetic profile of different ALCL cell lines. Furthermore, we plan to use NPM-ALK transgenic mice to elucidate the role of DNA methylation and Polycomb proteins in murine lymphomagenesis and to isolate putative novel targets of epigenetic aberrations. To investigate the biological importance of these aberrations, we will treat human cell lines with specific epigenetic drugs. We will intercross mice with a T-cell specific deletion of Dnmt1 with NPM-ALK transgenic mice to study the effects of DNA hypomethylation on NPM-ALK dependent tumor-formation and -progression. The use of epigenetic drugs, such as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and histone deacetylase inhibitors has been approved by the US food and drug administration for the treatment of specific hematological malignancies, and clinical trials have shown the beneficial effects for several tumor types of tumors. Thus, our study may elucidate novel molecular mechanisms of the disease and provide a rationale for the application of epigenetic drugs to target ALCL.

The aetiology of schizophrenia involves both genetic vulnerability and several environmental risk factors, of which the most preventable is cannabis use. It is therefore important to establish a) the patterns of exposure to cannabis that are especially likely to provoke psychosis, and b) who is especially vulnerable. My study will build on a large epidemiological EU-FP7 study of first onset psychosis for which I designed the interview regarding drug use. I will examine: a) GWAS and cannabis use data from 2,000 cases and 2,000 controls; b) baseline peripheral blood EWAS data from a subset of cases and controls (N=800) with additional genome-wide RNA data (N=600). The London participants will be followed up at a mean of 5 years and re-sampled for longitudinal EWAS (N=600) and RNA(N=400)profiling analyses. My aims are to: 1. Develop a simple method of assessing patterns of cannabis use which best predict the development of a cannabis-associated psychosis, and so enable identification of those individuals most at risk of a) psychosis onset and b) poor outcome. 2. Establish the proportion of psychosis cases attributable to cannabis use in 5 European countries. 3. Using the GWAs data, to determine the effectiveness of combining Schizophrenia Polygenic Risk scores, including Pathway-informed ones, with information on cannabis use in order to predict a)risk of developing a psychotic disorder; b)clinical and functional outcome 5 years following onset of psychosis. 4. Carry out longitudinal-multidimensional GWAS-guided analyses of a)EWAS and b)genome-wide RNA expression data to identify pathways involved in cannabis-associated psychosis. My work will establish a)those patterns of cannabis use which best predict psychosis, b)easily accessible biological markers of susceptibility to the effect of cannabis in provoking the onset and persistence of psychosis. It will be useful in developing better tailored preventative strategies and may indicate new drug targets.	Medical Research Council	Fellowship	1004670.0	GBP

Subjects would be recruited from our existing network of UK IBD Genetics Consortium (UKIBDGC) collaborating hospitals. The study coordinators will train CRN (clinical research network) nurses in each site to organise recruitment, consent, sample and data collection. Such CRN nurses are paid by the NIHR: their contribution to this study would be mandated if it is funded by the MRC. All IBD samples and data will be submitted to the NIHR BRC-MRC BioRepository team at Addenbrooke's, Cambridge. They have substantial expertise in high-throughput biological sample management, using LIMS tracking with automated storage and retrieval. Processing of all IBD samples will be undertaken by BioRepository personnel using established SOP's. DNA and serum will be extracted and quality checked using automated systems and deposited in fully monitored low temperature storage. Dr Tim Peakman, Executive Director of UK Biobank, will provide strategic guidance on biobanking issues. Once UK Biobank BioRepository South is complete the intention is to move the IBD Bioresource to this new facility. An IBD Bioresource management committee co-chaired by PI Parkes will, with the study coordinators, oversee recruitment and liaison with clinical centres. Proposals to use the IBD Bioresource will be reviewed by the NIHR BioResource scientific advisory board, including UKIBDGC representatives. Recall of patients for approved projects will be handled through the existing Cambridge NIHR BioResource mechanism. Data generated on IBD Bioresource subjects (existing genotyping and sequencing data generated from our UKIBDGC studies) will be held on the central NIHR BioResource database and accessible to collaborating researchers.

Our system model is the Natural Killer (NK) cell. Specifically, we will investigate the mechanisms by which these players of innate immunity achieve tolerance to self and participate to immune responses. Multidisciplinary approaches will be combined to achieve groundbreaking results at nanoscopic and macroscopic scales on the following issues:- How NK cells are educated to self-tolerance?- How NK cells distinguish their targets from normal cells?- How NK cells participate to immunological memory?THINK (THe Immune function of Natural Killer cells) is a challenging project supported by an array of preliminary data obtained by our team of investigators in various fields of expertise:- innate immunity and NK cells in human and mouse models- random insertional mutagenesis in the mouse- genome-wide epigenetic, transcriptomic and RNAi analysis and - state-of-the-art optical imaging techniques from intravital biphoton microscopy to the quantification of proteins in nano-sized areas of the cell. THINK is thus a multidisciplinary project that bridges disciplines: immunology, biophysics, genetics and epigenetics. In a scientific perspective, we think that this project will open new technological and scholar horizons, in reassessing the actual concepts on the links between innate immunity, tissue homeostasis and stress response. In a clinical and translational perspective, we also think that this project will help to design innovative NK cell-based therapies and immunomonitoring protocols.

Epigenetics - the study of variations in gene activity not caused by changes to the underlying DNA - is an ever-more important area of research within the biomedical sciences. Further, there is policy and practice interest in the potential of epigenetics for health and society. However, it is as yet under-studied by social scientists and bioethicists (although their attention is increasingly fixed upon it). The proposed research will help to address this deficit. It will ask how epigeneticists u nderstand, frame and respond to the social and ethical implications of their research. The project will thus cast new light on how scientists understand the responsibilities they have to biomedicine, policy, and wider society. Further, the study will explore the extent to which these may shape the conduct and direction of the science itself. Methodologically, the research will involve ten qualitative interviews with UK opinion-leaders in epigenetics (conducted over 12 months), leading to at leas t one high-quality peer-reviewed publication. It will develop the previous and current work of the applicant, whilst also feeding into wider science and technology studies (STS) and bioethics debates around technoscience and responsibility.

Mothers are exposed to very high levels of placental hormones during pregnancy. Data from animal models suggest that these hormones are important for maternal behaviour. Several imprinted genes regulate the endocrine compartment of the placenta suggesting a role for placental epigenetics in maternal behaviour. We will examine maternal behaviour in an animal model in which the endocrine compartment of the placenta is compromised by genetically altered expression of an imprinted gene. In preliminary work, we find that wild type females change their behaviour towards their pups and show altered brain gene expression in response to our placental mutation. Concurrently, we will undertake a study examining the expression of imprinted genes and hormones in term placenta from women assessed for symptoms of depression (Edinburgh Depression Scale) and anxiety (Spielberger State/Trait Index) before and immediately after delivery. We will initially apply targeted RNAseq and pyrosequencing to a set of discovery placental samples representing extreme moods to obtain further evidence that imprinted genes and placental hormones are aberrantly expressed. Our pilot data identified significantly altered placental expression of an imprinted gene and placental lactogen associated with prenatal depression. Finally, we will bring these two projects together to test the function of the most promising candidate gene identified in our human study in the experimental protocol established using our current animal model. At the end of this study we will have a list of gene changes associated with maternal mood disorders and experimental evidence that these play a causal role.

This project is concerned with the question of why painful conditions should persist over many years, despite the fact that the initial injury or disease has remitted. It is a phenomenon commonly observed in the clinic, where patients might for instance be plagued by back pain long after the initial sports injury healed. What is known is that their nervous system appears to have adopted a permanent maladaptive state as a result of an initial condition. What is unknown is what molecular mechanisms enable this maladaptive state to persist over long periods of time. This project investigates the novel hypothesis that the emergence of latent enhancers permanently alters the phenotype of the neurons and immune cells involved in nociception - ultimately turning acute pain into a lasting chronic condition. Latent enhancers are regulatory regions that emerge in the genome as a result of stimulation once cell development is complete. They have been shown to occur in immune cells, and I have recently been able to observe their appearance in mouse microglia in a model of chronic pain (Denk et al, Cell Reports, 2016). Based on this work, this proposal aims to answer the following three questions: 1. Do latent enhancers also emerge in neurons, where nociception ultimately takes place? 2. Do latent enhancers display characteristics that would allow them to act as a molecular memory? 3. Does the deposition of latent enhancers have functional consequences? Enhancer profiles ultimately determine cell identity, and post-developmental changes to these profiles could therefore affect cell function in the long term. The results of this work would help elucidate the origins of chronic pain, ultimately facilitating the search for effective prevention or treatment. They would also help uncover generic mechanisms of how the environment can impact gene function in a cell-type specific manner.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	447885.0	GBP

A small number of studies have identified long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that have importance for endothelial cell biology in general, but their function and consequences in angiogenesis are poorly defined. One of the major functions of lncRNAs is to regulate the target-coding gene expression by association with chromatin. Several lncRNAs interact with repressive EZH2 component of PRC2 complex, that is a major histone H3K27 methyltransferase in the endothelial cells, which negatively regulates transcription. Blocking the EZH2 binding or its direct association with lncRNA could potentially modify pro-angiogenic gene expression and functional consequences thereof. For this work, I will use genomics, bioinformatics, and pharmacological approaches to study these interactions and manipulate them with a focus on assessing their mechanistic influence and impact on promoting post-ischemic reparative angiogenesis.

Such plasticity or potency is essential to form multiple cell types upon differentiation. In mammals, upon fertilization and fusion of the gametes -two highly differentiated cells- intense chromatin remodeling and epigenetic reprogramming, the reversion into an undifferentiated state, are essential to restore full developmental potency (totipotency). Subsequent development and differentiation are accompanied with progressive loss of plasticity. The transition between totipotency and the gradual loss of plasticity is thought to be regulated by yet-unknown epigenetic mechanisms.The embryonic chromatin displays unique features compared to differentiated cells, including the lack of ?conventional' heterochromatin. We hypothesise that the transition from a totipotent state to a differentiated one is regulated by changes in chromatin states, particularly by de novo acquisition of heterochromatin domains.This project is designed to reveal the nuclear foundations of totipotency by determining the molecular mechanisms underlying the establishment of heterochromatin and their functional role in maintaining totipotency using the mouse embryo as model.We will do this by:i)determining the functional relationship of heterochromatin and nuclear architectureii)by determining the effects of artificially inducing heterochromatin on cell potency during development andiii)by determining the mechanisms that regulate heterochromatin formation in the embryo.We anticipate that our studies will unravel fundamental mechanims on how chromatin states regulate cell potency during reprogramming. By uncovering such mechanisms, we expect to reveal new insights that will be useful to induce epigenetic reprogramming of differentiated cells. Our results will therefore lead to key contributions in the fields of stem cell, developmental biology, human reproduction, chromatin biology and epigenetics.

94	Prof Kate Tilling	University of Bristol	Social Medicine	2016-01-29	2018-11-21	Development of a multilevel and mixture-model framework for modelling epigenetic changes over time (resubmission)	Epigenetic modifications (e.g. DNA methylation) are increasingly used to investigate how the environment and lifestyle impact upon disease risk. Recent technological advances have facilitated the large scale generation of longitudinal epigenetic data, and there is a need to develop statistical tools for use in this field. There are three main motivations for analyses of epigenetic changes over time: to identify areas of methylation which are more/less stable over time; to examine how exposures (e.g. environmental exposures, or behaviours such as smoking) are associated with the epigenetic changes; and to investigate the potential health consequences of epigenetic changes. Analyses are complicated by the high-dimensionality of the epigenetic space and correlation within CpG regions. We will develop multilevel and mixture methods for more robust analysis of dynamic epigenetic data. We will use MLMs to identify sites and regions which vary over time. We will compare three ways of pre-analysis dimension reduction, including extending DPPCA for application to epigenetic data. We will develop multivariate MLMs for modelling epigenetic change at several sites with respect to exposure/outcome. Current GGMM and Bayesian Mixture Models will be extended and used to derive latent classes of change across several CpG sites, and to identify the small number of CpG sites with evidence of effects which change over time. We will then develop methods to assess whether genetic variation changes over time, for example are specific to particular developmental stages. Power and performance of all methods under a range of study designs will be compared, using simulations. Data from ALSPAC and other longitudinal studies available to the co-applicants, will be used to benchmark our methods and conclusions. These data will be from 450k and bisulphite sequencing datasets, but the methods will be applicable to any application with a large number of correlated measurements.

Yet, resolving these questions will be essential to fill the current gaps in understanding the molecular basis of epigenetic programming of cell identity.In this regard, the recent discovery of active DNA demethylation revolutionized our thinking about the epigenetic role of cytosine methylation (5mC). We and others were able to show that gene regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers undergo cyclic methylation and de-methylation through an enzymatic process involving oxidation, excision and repair of methylated DNA bases (5mC). This clashes with the classical view of 5mC as a stable epigenetic mark, a concept that hence fails to provide a rationale for a function of dynamic methylation changes.The overarching goal of this project is therefore to clarify the epigenetic function of such, apparently futile, active DNA demethylation. On the basis of a substantial body of preliminary evidence, we postulate that cyclic methylation-demethylation is targeted to genomic sites to trigger epigenetic plasticity at the nucleosomal level, via induction of DNA repair processes. The research proposed here thus focuses on the following objectives: 1: Establishing a functional and mechanistic link between active DNA demethylation and dynamic nucleosome states2: Determining the implicated role of RNA and DNA/RNA hybrid molecules in cyclic active DNA demethylation and the maintenance of epigenetic plasticityThis research program introduces a novel conceptual approach to address the epigenetic function of active DNA demethylation. A successful completion of the proposed research will provide a mechanistic link between DNA methylation and nucleosomal behavior, a fundamental question of epigenetics.

96	Dr Roderick	Babraham Institute	None	None	2018-09-30	BBSRC DTG Studentship: Foetal programming of cardiac health	The amount of nutrition that the foetus experiences whilst in the womb (in utero) influences how it makes use of the food it receives as an adult. This is particularly important for a foetus that has been nutritionally deprived in utero, which, as a result of too much nutrition after birth develops diseases, including diabetes and high blood pressure. It has been hypothesised that this adaptive response of the organism to experience in utero is determined by changes in the expression levels of certain genes (the copying of information form DNA to RNA then often into protein). As the DNA complement of an organism cannot be changed, this alteration in gene expression is achieved by modifications of the proteins that control the structure of the DNA; i.e. Epigenetic modifications. So far, it is not known whether this foetal programming of adult health affects how the heart grows in response to increased workload or whether there is an increased risk of heart failure. In addition, it is not known if gene expression in the heart is controlled by epigenetic modifications to the DNA generated in utero. In this study, we will investigate whether rats that have been nutritionally deprived in utero are at a greater risk of developing hypertrophy (an increase in cell size without increase in cell number) and whether their myocytes (muscle cells) are more likely to undergo hypertrophic growth following exposure to a particular stress. We will then determine whether epigenetics plays a role in controlling whether nutritional experience in utero impacts upon future cardiac health.

Reclassification of NDs is therefore urgently needed. From a therapeutic perspective, reclassification should be based on causal and druggable factors. BRAIN-MEND will reclassify existing phenotypes using pathway and network analyses within and across complex NDs including Alzheimer Disease, Parkinson Disease, ALS, FTD, Corticobasal Degeneration, MSA, and PSP. We will use three innovative approaches, pioneered or adopted by the consortium: WP1 will apply the latest methods to identify causal genetic factors acting on molecular pathways; WP2 will apply cutting edge methods to identify epigenetic factors associated with molecular pathways of ND; and WP3 will identify drug targets from network analyses using results from WP1 and WP2 without requiring prior knowledge of mechanism. WP4 will use analysis of medical literature and patient records to identify novel or under-recognized clusters of related clinical features. These complementary approaches allow for iterative cross-validation of elucidated factors by WP1-4. BRAIN-MEND will reclassify ND phenotypes based on biologically meaningful categories corresponding to subgroups (heterogeneity) and common pathways (pleiotropy) to enhance disease understanding and facilitate drug development across the entire complex ND landscape. WP5 will manage the project and disseminate results. Patients and caregivers will be intimately involved throughout the project. Our consortium is highly qualified to perform the work proposed, as evidenced by a mean PI h-index of 61, major impact in research in neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatry, direct expertise with and access to a large and rich dataset spanning all complex NDs, track record in cross disorder analyses, and the related tools, biobanks and cell models needed.

99	Dr. Manu DUBIN	GMI - Gregor Mendel Institute of Molecular Plant Biology	None	2011-12-01	2013-11-30	An epigenome-wide association studys in plants	The creation, or selection, of plant cultivars with more sophisticated traits and improved adaptability to extreme environmental perturbations will require detailed knowledge of the many factors controlling the plant phenotype. Heritable variation was traditionally thought to occur exclusively as a result of DNA sequence polymorphisms, but it is now clear that a significant portion of heritable variation occurs by other means, among which epigenetic processes appear to play a major role (Madlung and Comai, 2004; Richards, 2006; Richards, 2008; Bossdorf et al., 2008). Understanding the degree of epigenetic diversity and its influence on the relationship between environment, genotype and phenotype should improve our ability to predict the effect of environmental changes on performance and potential of plants and their progeny. To reach this goal this project aims to: • quantify the amount of epigenetic variation that occurs as a result of DNA sequence polymorphisms, and identify which epigenetic marks are involved, • quantify the amount of epigenetic variation that occurs as a result of environmental variation, and detect which environmental changes and which marks are involved, • investigate the interplay of genetic, epigenetic and environmental variation on phenotype. To date, a major stumbling block in the field has been the sheer complexity of, and the interplay between, the many factors that control the phenotype. We propose to overcome this by integrating methodologies from the fields of both population genetics and classical epigenetics. Specifically, we will extend genome-wide association studies by using whole genome approaches such as sequencing after chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) and after bisulfite conversion (BS-seq) to map the epigenome, and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to investigate the transcriptome. In this approach, a set of Arabidopsis accessions, selected to be both genetically and potentially epigenetically most divergent, will be subject to epigenomic profiling for DNA methylation, histone modifications and nucleosome occupancy. The differences in distribution of chromatin marks between the accessions will then be used as “epi-phenotypes” for genome-wide association mapping. They will also be used as “epi-polymorphisms” for epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). These experiments will be repeated on plants that have been grown for multiple generations under a variety of conditions favoring slow or fast growth, in extreme habitats or under different climatic conditions, nutrition or light regimes. This will enable us to understand the relationship between genetic, environmental and chromatin variation, to address which biotic and abiotic factors induce epigenetic variation, and to explore the link between genetic and epigenetic variation, phenotypic plasticity and environmental adaption. The inheritance of chromatin marks over multiple generations and their effect on phenotype will be used to examine the role of epigenetics in transgenerational memory and environmental adaption.

100	Dr. Isabelle WEINHOFER-MOLISCH	Medical University of Vienna	None	2008-12-01	2010-05-31	Epigenetic profiling	Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic system of transcriptional regulation causing an allele-specific expression of some genes dependent on the parent-of-origin. Genomic imprinting occurs only in mammals and flowering plants and it is generally assumed that imprinted genes play an important role for the distribution of nutrients from the mother to the offspring. Genomic imprinting in flowering plants has long been inferred to play an important role in seed development. However, the mechanism of genomic imprinting in plants is only partially understood and likely involves alterations in DNA and hisone methylation and chromatin structure between the differentially expressed maternal and paternal alleles. Therefore, a central question of this project is to clarify when imprinting marks are established and how are they maintained during endosperm development. We will use state of the art molecular biology techniques to track DNA and histone methylation directly from gametes to different stages of endosperm development, enabling an exploration of the timing of genomic imprinting. Currently, only a small number of imprinted genes have been described in plants. Thus, we will also focus on the identification of new imprinted genes in Arabidopsis. Together, the proposed project will deepen the knowledge of the mechanism of genomic imprinting in plants and will also provide further important insights into the influence of imprinting on seed development. Currently, one of the main focuses of plant research in Vienna (e.g. at the Gregor Mendel Institute) is the epigenetic plasticity of plant genomes in context of gene regulation, chromosome biology and development. Furthermore, epigenetic mechanisms are of substantial interest for medical research as well and are intensively investigated at the Institute of Molecular Pathology in Vienna. Several epigenetic mechanisms are evolutionary conserved, therefore, we expect that the results of the proposed research will not only be of interest to plant scientists but will reveal mechanisms of parent-of-origin dependent gene regulation that are conserved between mammals and flowering plants. Last but not least, imprinted genes play an important role during endosperm development. Endosperm represents mankind's most important renewable resource for food, feed and industrial raw material. Therefore, the proposed research is not merely of academic but potentially also of great economic interest. Thus, the knowledge gained from this innovative research project will be of particular use for the Austrian research done in the field of epigenetics and seed development.

101	Ao. Prof. Dr. Gerda EGGER	Medical University of Vienna	None	2019-01-01	2021-12-31	Dissecting the Role of HDAC1 in T Cell Lymphoma	Histone deacetylases are important chromatin modifying enzymes that counteract histone acetyltransferases by removing acetyl groups from both histone and non-histone proteins. Removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues of core histones results in chromatin compaction and a repressive chromatin environment. Deregulation of chromatin states is frequently found in cancer and thus, HDAC inhibitors have been successfully used in cancer therapy. Several HDAC inhibitors are FDA approved and are used for the treatment of haematological malignancies including T cell lymphoma or are tested in clinical studies. HDAC1, a major family member of class I HDACs, is essential for early development in mice and its conditional deletion in different tissues impairs cellular homeostasis and proliferation. Unexpectedly, recent reports showed that reduced HDAC1 and HDAC2 levels in thymocytes could predispose mice towards lymphoma development. To study the role of HDAC1 for lymphoma development, we used a transgenic mouse model mimicking human anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Following the T-cell specific expression of the NPM-ALK oncogenic fusion protein, these mice develop mediastinal tumors at around 20 weeks of age. Intriguingly, conditional deletion of Hdac1 in T cells of these transgenic mice caused a dramatic acceleration of tumorigenesis. Based on these results we hypothesize that HDAC1 has an oncosuppressive role in early T cell development, which is different from the observed effects of HDAC inhibitor treatment of malignant cells resulting in differentiation and apoptosis of tumor cells. The proposed project aims to investigate the function of HDAC1 and a possible compensatory role of HDAC2 for oncogene driven lymphomagenesis and to compare the effects of genetic and chemical depletion of HDAC1/2 within a transgenic mouse model. Additionally, we plan to identify specific acetylation targets of HDAC1/2 on histones and non-histone proteins following Hdac1/2 knockout or pharmacological inhibition using HDAC inhibitors. The project partners will use their complementing expertise and employ next generation sequencing based techniques (e.g. RNA-Seq, ATAC-seq) as well as proteomics- in particular acetylomics- to decipher the targets and pathways affected by loss or inhibition of HDAC enzymes. Main researchers responsible for the project will be Zbynek Zdrahal, an expert in proteomics and head of the Research Group Proteomics at CEITEC (Brno, CZ) and Gerda Egger an epigenetics specialist affiliated with the Clinical Institute of Pathology of the Medical University of Vienna (AT). The results from these experiments will provide insights into the molecular alterations following loss of HDAC activity that predispose T-cells towards ALK-induced lymphoma development. They will also have direct implications for the possible incidence and evaluation of beneficial and adverse effects in HDACi therapy and will provide a molecular rationale for molecular indications and contraindications of these drugs in lymphoma treatment.

The formation of polyploid plants is often connected with transcriptional gene silencing (TGS), an epigenetic change resulting in heritable, complete loss of gene expression from previously active genes, accompanied by chemical modification of the affected DNA and its associated proteins and by structural changes of the chromatin. Epigenetics in polyploids and the underlying mechanisms are interesting in the view of basic plant biology as well as for better understanding the principles of plant breeding. Based on previous observations of polyploidy-associated transcriptional gene silencing (PA-TGS) of a resistance gene in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, this proposal suggests determining which trans- and cis- acting elements are involved in this regulation. The potentially reversible inactive marker gene allows for a selection-based identification of trans-acting factors, required for maintenance of the inactive state. The search can identify new factors as well as determine the role of already known gene products. Building on loss-of-function or over-expression of the identified molecules, it will be determined which parts of the genome are susceptible to PA-TGS. Inactive and active status of the same gene in diploid and polyploid plants will be compared for their chromatin features and permit addressing the role of chromosomal location and gene structure.

A surprising link between epigenetics and RNAi was discovered more than a decade ago, and I was fortunate enough to be involved in this exciting field of research from the beginning. It is now well established that endogenous small RNAs have a direct impact on the genome in various organisms. Yet, the initiation of chromatin modifications in trans by exogenously introduced small RNAs has been inherently difficult to achieve in all eukaryotic cells. This has sparked controversy about the importance and conservation of RNAi-mediated epigenome regulation and hampered systematic mechanistic dissection of this phenomenon. Using fission yeast, we have discovered a counter-acting mechanism that impedes small RNA-directed formation of heterochromatin and constitutes the foundation of this proposal. Our goal is to close several knowledge gaps and test the intriguing possibility that the suppressive mechanism we discovered is conserved in mammalian cells. We will employ yeast and embryonic stem cells and use cutting-edge technologies (i.e., chemical mutagenesis combined with whole-genome sequencing, genome editing with engineered nucleases, and single-cell RNA sequencing) to address fundamental, as yet unanswered questions. My proposal consists of four major aims. In aim 1, I propose to use proteomics approaches and to perform yeast genetic screens to define additional pathway components and regulatory factors. Aim 2 builds on our ability to finally trigger de novo formation of heterochromatin by synthetic siRNAs acting in trans, addressing many of the outstanding mechanistic questions that could not be addressed in the past. In Aims 3 and 4, experiments conducted in yeast and mouse cells will elucidate missing fragments critical to our understanding of the conserved principles behind RNAi-mediated epigenetic gene regulation.

The study will look at two environmental insults in utero for which there is epidemiological and early experimental evidence to support a role in epigenetic-mediated disease pathogenesis. The study also seeks to study the transgenerational effects of this epigenetic change through both somatic tissues and the germline. Design and methodology: A human model will identify individuals with gestational diabetes and hyperhomocysteinaemia from a local population at high risk of cardiometabolic disease. DNA from offspring cord blood will be studied and compared to parental DNA to examine de novo environmental effects on DNA methylation. A rodent model of gestational diabetes and methionine-induced hyperhomocysteinaemia will mirror this model, allowing investigation epigenetic variants and their inheritance between successive generations using sperm and oocytes and controlled breeding. In both models, epigenetic will be identified in offspring by the use of ‘next generation‘ sequencing (Solexa) and custom bioinformatic analysis. This will be followed by targeted bisulphite sequencing of familial epialleles of interest. Further study will examine tissue-specific epigenetic variants, RNA expression and chromatin remodelling. Scientific and medical opportunities: The design of this study and techniques used will provide understanding of environmentally-mediated epigenetic reprogramming and inheritance from a truly genome-wide perspective. Identification of common dietary and metabolic insults in pregnancy that may predispose to disease risk in offspring will allow effective treatment interventions against a cluster of conditions that is increasing in prevalence globally.

Epigenetics describes the regulation of gene expression, chromosome stability, genomic imprinting, and stem cell fate through inherited and acquired modifications of DNA, histones and proteins. Alterations in epigenetic signaling are involved in major diseases including cancer, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases.

Cancer is a clonal disease originating from a single cell. Yet, most human cancers are characterized by astounding intra-tumour heterogeneity and comprise various subpopulations of cells with distinct phenotypes and biological properties. Even neighbouring cells within a tumour may have different morphologies, express differential transcriptional programs and display specific repertoires of surface molecules. Most importantly, not all cancer cells possess the same proliferative potential and in most cancers only a subset of cells is truly immortal. These cells act as CSCs and are responsible for maintaining the long-term growth of the tumour. This group is interested in understanding how epigenetic mechanisms involving histone modifications, higher-order chromatin structure and DNA methylation contribute to intra-tumour heterogeneity and how they affect CSC function. State-of-the-art molecular and cell biological methods in combination with advanced light microscopy techniques and in vivo approaches are used to characterize functionally important epigenetic traits of CSCs, with the ultimate goal of identifying novel therapeutic targets.

Current views of eukaryotic gene regulation emphasize structural and epigenetic characteristics of chromatin itself as well as the spatial disposition of chromatin domains in the three-dimensional (3D) space of the nucleus. A major challenge is to elucidate not only the 3D architecture of interphase chromatin but also to integrate this spatial information with epigenetic modifications and chromatin mobility in vivo. The purpose of the work proposed here is to study how epigenetic processes impact 3D interphase chromosome disposition, dynamics and expression in living plant cells. The experiments will be performed using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, for which the necessary tools are available: (1) transgenic lines with fluorescent tags at different chromosomal sites, which can be viewed in interphase nuclei of living plants; and (2) mutants impaired in various types of epigenetic gene silencing. Results from these investigations will help to integrate epigenetic modifications into a comprehensive picture of the the 3D organization and dynamic nature of interphase chromatin in living cells.

Understanding on how and why these mechanisms are altered in many disorders (cancer, autoimmune diseases, ageing, etc.) has become a growing priority in biomedical research. This proposal represents a logical continuation of an existing collaboration between two laboratories funded by the grants from the MRC, NSFC and the UK-China Science Bridges Programme, which is focused on the analyses of roles of distinct epigenetic regulators in the control of stem cell activity during development and regeneration. This project will extend this successful collaboration and will study the role of Polycomb gene Cbx4 in the control of stem cell activity during wound-induced skin regeneration. We will test the hypothesis that Cbx4 plays important roles in the control of gene expression programmes in adult epithelial stem cells during skin regeneration and: 1) Define whether the loss of Cbx4 activity in vivo will affect the self-renewing and differentiation potentials of skin epithelial stem cells and their progenies during wound healing; 2) Identify upstream regulators controlling Cbx4 expression in adult epithelial stem cells and their lineage-committed progenies. Researchers from both labs will exchange knowledge relevant to their areas of expertise (skin/stem cell biology, molecular biology/epigenetics) and will share resources, data and ideas to generate data for large-scale joint grant proposals that will look at epigenetic regulation of stem cell activity in normal and diseased skin. Success of this project will help in better understanding the complexity of regulatory mechanisms that control stem cell activity in regenerating epithelial tissues and in designing new approaches on how to target stem cells in the clinical conditions accompanied by their un-controlled activation/expansion or exhausting/loss.

MFS is characterized by increased metastasis after numerous local recurrences. Cytogenetic karyotype data suggest that genomic complexity increases with disease progression leading to metastasis. Limited therapeutic options for high-grade MFS and consequent dismal outcome stem from our incomplete understanding of the molecular events underlying its pathogenesis and progression. Additionally, the study of MFS has been limited by the lack of adequate samples and tumor cell lines.Aim: We aim to unravel the molecular alterations of MFS, a model of understudied and poorly understood high grade sarcomas with a complex karyotype, in order to nominate key genetic and epigenomic events in tumor progression and possible drug targets.Methods: Using next generation sequencing techniques, we will interrogate freshly frozen and paraffin fixed MFS human tumor samples and corresponding cell lines. We will use an established computational integrative analysis pipeline to investigate the array of transcriptomic, genomic and epigenomic alterations with the goal of identifying key drivers focusing on drug targetable events.Summary: The molecular determinants of aggressiveness of MFS and therapeutic targets remain elusive. We will take a significant step in characterizing the molecular landscape of this complex karyotype sarcoma with the goal of understanding the drivers of progression and nominating potential therapeutic targets.

Klinisch-Biologische Wissenschaften Universität Basel	2010-03-01	2015-02-28	Polycomb complex-mediated and epigenetic regulation of thymic epithelial cell development: an integrative genomic analysis	Background: The thymus provides the physiological microenvironment for the development of the majority of T lymphocytes. Its role is critical for the successful establishment and maintenance of the immune system's capacity to distinguish between vital “Self” and injurious “Non-Self”. This vital function is primarily instructed by thymic epithelial cells (TECs). Throughout life, terminally differentiated thymic cortical and medullary epithelia are replaced at a relatively high rate calling for the intra-thymic existence of a pool of precursor cells responsible for this continuous TEC turnover. However, neither the nature of the intrathymic stem/precursor cell nor the molecular mechanisms responsible for thymic organogenesis and the life-long homeostatic TEC maintenance are at present known in detail. Using integrative functional genomic analyses, the proposed research seeks to identify the molecular features that characterise thymic epithelial progenitor cells and that govern thymic tissue formation and preservation. Specifically, the chromatin modifying components Ring1A/B of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) and the function of the transcription factor Oct4 will be investigated for their role in TEC precursor biology and the phenomenon of de-differentiation of adult, respectively. Working Hypotheses: The current grant application is based on the testable hypotheses that(i)genes targeted by Ring1A/B are essential for TEC progenitor cell survival and the regular formation of their progeny; (ii) Oct4 driven de-differentiation of adult TECs to TEC precursors is dependent on the presence of Ring1A/B but can be rendered more efficiently by the absence of p53.(iii) Oct4 driven de-differentiation of adult TECs correlates with changes in histone marks, DNA methylation and microRNA expression providing insight into the mechanisms operational in TEC reprogramming.Specific Aims:#1: To determine the gene targets of Ring1A/B-mediated PRC1 function in progenitor and terminally differentiated TEC.#2: To investigate whether the effect of ectopic Oct4 expression on TEC dedifferentiation is dependent on the concomitant function of Ring1A and/or Ring1B and whether the absence of p53 impacts on the effect of Oct4.#3: To establish the gene expression profile and the epigenetic changes in TEC de-differentiation following Oct4 expression..Experimental Design and Methods:Novel transgenic mouse models combined with state of the art methods in molecular, cellular and computational biology will be used to address specific questions related to the genetic and epigenetic circuitry operational in gaining and maintaining TEC “stemness” and in the control of their differentiation. Expected Value of the Proposed ProjectInsight gained from the proposed studies will be important to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for the formation, homeostatic maintenance as well as the differentiation of thymic epithelial stem/precursor cells. This knowledge will be required to establish rational strategies for the (re)generation of functional thymic tissue to be used in specific cell therapy . These aspects are of particular relevance given the promise of embryonic stem cells (ESC) and somatic cells induced to a pluripotent state (i.e. iPS) to be utilized as a cellular source to restore thymic functions in the aged, in clinical situations of iatrogenic thymic hypoplasia/dysplasia, and in instances of congenital athymia, respectively.Keywords: Thymus organogenesis, functional genomics, epigenetics, Polycomb group proteins Ring-1A/B, Oct4, p53, thymus epithelial stem/precursor cells, (de-)differentiation,	Swiss National Science Foundation	NRP 63 Stem cells and regenerative medicine	567816.0	CHF

Epigenetics has been mostly studied in eukaryotes such as fungi, plants and humans, where it has now become evident that it plays important roles during embryogenesis, cellular differentiation, genomic imprinting and cancer development. Methylated cytosines (m5C and m4C) and adenines (m6A) are also frequently found in bacterial genomes due to the activity of restriction-modification systems acting as immigration controllers preventing horizontal gene transfers, but also of orphan DNA methyl-transferases (MTases) involved in DNA mismatch repair and/or in regulating gene expression to control a variety of processes including pathogenesis and virulence. Our previous work on the cell cycle-regulated DNA MTase CcrM that is found in most Alphaproteobacteria, has uncovered a tight connection between adenine methylation and cell cycle control in the model C. crescentus bacterium. Still, too little is known on which genes are directly regulated by DNA methylation in Alphaproteobacteria and on epigenetic regulators that can sense DNA methylation marks to modulate gene expression. The first aim of this proposal is to address this issue directly. We will use (epi)genomics and classical molecular biology methods to identify genes regulated by DNA methylation in the environmental bacterium Caulobacter crescentus and in the distantly-related Agrobacterium tumefaciens plant pathogen. We will then select the most interesting genes, preferentially regulated in a CcrM-dependent manner in all three bacteria, to identify novel and conserved epigenetic regulators in C. crescentus using forward genetics or biochemical screens. Considering that the expression of the majority of the genes suspected to be regulated by DNA methylation is cell cycle-regulated and/or encoding proteins involved in DNA metabolism in C. crescentus, we hope to uncover novel cell cycle regulators that we will characterize in more details to reveal their mechanism(s) of action and their function(s) in Alphaproteobacteria.Although DNA methylation plays important roles in so many organisms, it comes with a serious drawback: m5C can be accidentally deaminated into thymines (T). Resulting TG DNA mismatches must be corrected before they get replicated or they can turn into permanent mutations. Bacteria use Vsr endonucleases during the Very Small Patch (VSP) repair process to eliminate these mismatches but the regulation and the specificity of this process remain unclear, especially in bacteria that have multiple cytosine MTases and multiple Vsr-like proteins like C. crescentus. The second aim of this proposal is to characterize and visualize the VSP process in live C. crescentus cells using molecular genetics and state-of-the-art microscopy experiments. Considering that VSP repair also requires MutS and MutL, two proteins also involved in the repair of DNA mismatches escaping from the proofreading activity of the replicative DNA polymerase (MMR), we will study the potential competition or cooperation between MMR and VSP repair in C. crescentus cells. Defects in DNA mismatch repair are a concern for human health as they can promote the incidence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains or of several cancers and neurodegenerative diseases.

If left untreated, malaria can become life threatening and took about 627’000 lives in 2012, the majority being children and pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa. It is caused by apicomplexan parasites of the genus Plasmodium, which are transmitted by female Anopheles mosquitoes. When sexual stages of Plasmodium are taken up during a mosquito blood meal, male and female gametes fuse in the mosquito midgut to form a tetraploid zygote. The Plasmodium zygote then develops into a motile stage called the ookinete, which migrates through the mosquito midgut wall and forms an asexually growing sporulation oocyst at the basal lamina. It is known that this journey through the mosquito acts as a bottleneck in the parasite's life cycle where numbers decrease drastically. Therefore, this is a favourable stage for an intervention to take effect. In the last decade, it has become increasingly clear that epigenetic mechanisms are a very important hallmark in the parasite’s survival strategy within the human host. However, our knowledge of epigenetic orchestration of gene expression in the mosquito-stage parasites is virtually absent. Here, we will undertake a comprehensive investigation aiming to unravel the regulatory mechanisms underlying gene expression in the developing zygote/ookinete and how this might be related to the parasite transmission strategies through the vector. We believe that detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling malaria parasite development in the mosquito midgut will add substantially to the understanding of malaria transmission biology. This study will expand our understanding of epigenetics in Plasmodium sexual stages and can pave the way for the testing of epigenetic drugs towards blocking malaria transmission.

Most of them occur with no family history and no known cause. Aging is a major risk factor for most of these diseases, therefore they gain increasing attention since the life span of mankind is improving. As the causes are unknown, it is generally difficult to model such conditions in animals or cell culture to study pathogenic mechanisms or to test potential therapeutic strategies. From the central nervous system (CNS), tissue samples can only be removed when the patient reaches the end stage. Due to these difficulties, researchers started to make use of the recently developed reprogramming technology that allows reverting human skin fibroblasts to pluripotent stem cells. The generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can then be differentiated in various cell types including the ones found in the CNS. However, reprogramming erases most of the epigenetic memory that is steering the expression of genes and has been demonstrated to be directly involved in adult onset neurodegenerative diseases. Up to now, iPSC lines from patients with different neurodegenerative diseases including ALS have been produced, but once these cells are differentiated into disease relevant cell types, they mostly fail to reproduce the phenotype observed in patients.In 2011, a more direct and faster approach for the generation of neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) from mouse skin fibroblasts was published, which is presumably also leaving more of the epigenetic memory intact.In the presented study, we want to apply this approach to human skin fibroblasts from sporadic ALS patients in order to establish a rapid method to produce astrocytes and model ALS in vitro. My preliminary data demonstrate that with this method, I am able to generate ALS patient derived astrocytes. These cells convey toxicity towards motor neurons in a similar manner as primary human ALS astrocytes and ALS astrocytes derived from post-mortem spinal cord NPCs. This finding is exciting, as astrocytes derived from ALS iPS lines failed to reproduce such pathologic features in several independent laboratories. Thanks to the close collaboration with the ALS clinic at the Ohio State University Hospital, our laboratory now possesses both, iPS lines as well as fibroblasts from the same patient. Having established the direct conversion for human fibroblasts, we are now able to compare astrocytes derived by the two different methods in order to expose disease relevant differences in the transcriptome. Therefore this project is of huge interested for the ALS field, but also for a broad science community working on neurodegenerative diseases, reprogramming or differentiation and epigenetics. Finally, our findings can help to unravel potential new therapeutic targets against this devastating disease.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Fellowships for advanced researchers	None	None

Our aim is to provide the evidence base that will improve treatment success with IVF and enable stratified and effective antenatal care in IVF and spontaneous conceptions (SC). This is important because up to 40% or pregnancies are affected by one or more of miscarriage, stillbirth, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes, preterm birth or delivery or a small or large for gestational aged infant, but we do not know the best way of preventing these. IVF is now the commonest treatment for infertility with >250K IVF cycles completed per year in the UK and on average 1 in 30 primary school children were born as a result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). Success rates vary by couple and treatment characteristics but are between 20-30%. There are suggestions that IVF per se, and pregnancy complications in IVF and SC have important adverse effects on future offspring cardio-metabolic health, but whether these associations are causal and if so their magnitude is unclear. Our objectives are to accurately predict and identify causal paths for: (i) response to IVF; (ii) healthy pregnancy and perinatal outcomes in IVF and SC; and (iii) offspring cardio-metabolic health. Methods Our focus will primarily be on maternal smoking, physical activity, sleep patterns, adiposity, pregnancy metabolic profiles and fetal (cord-blood) DNA methylation as potential predictors or risk factors. We will use data from detailed clinical and general pregnancy/birth cohorts. We will work with relevant consortia, including the EuroCHILD pan-European birth cohort that we are involved in establishing from 26 existing cohorts, early growth genetics (EGG) consortia, in which we co-lead maternal-offspring genetic analyses, the Genetics of Diabetes In Pregnancy (GENdip) consortia that we have recently developed, and the pregnancy/birth cohorts working group aligned to the Consortia Of METabolomics Studies (COMETS), which we lead, as well as the Pregnancy And Child Epigenetics (PACE) consortia, which we work closely with alongside Relton’s MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit programme. We will triangulate results across the following analytical methods applied to these data sources: multivariable regression (MV), Mendelian randomization (MR), non-genetic instrumental variable (IV) analyses, within sibship and negative control studies. Translation Building on our successful impact on clinical guidelines in the first five-years of this programme, we will continue to work with relevant clinicians, patient groups and NICE guideline developers. For new methodological developments we will provide and share datasets and code and widely disseminate these.	Medical Research Council	Unit	None	None

Silver-Russell Syndrome (SRS) is a distinct subtype of the SGA population with poor fetal and postnatal growth. A proportion of these patients have duplication in the chromosome 11p15 locus which contains the IGF2 gene. This is known to be important in fetal growth with complex control mechanisms for expression including maternal imprinting and multiple promoters. It has recently been demonstrated that up to 30% of all SRS patients have undermethylation in the IGF2/H19 locus with associated reduced IGF2 expression. The hypothesis is that SRS is a result of IGF2 deficiency which is not necessarily secondary to the methylation abnormalities. The aim of the project is look at the methylation status of various differentially methylated regions in the IGF2-H19 locus using EBV transformed lymphocytes taken from patients enrolled in the NESTEGG study and to compare this with IGF2 expression. Methylation status will be examined using bisulphite treatment of DNA in conjunction with either product subcloning and sequencing or with pyrosequencing. IGF2 expression will be quantified using real-time TaqMan assay. An IGF2 ELISA assay will be used to compare protein expression to investigate translation of message. If IGF2 deficiency is more widespread compared to methylation abnormalities, alternative pathogenic mechanisms such as defective promoter function or abnormal histone acetylation and methylation will be investigated. If IGF2 deficiency is shown to be exclusive to those patients with methylation abnormalities, the IGF2 receptor epigenetics and function will be investigated further. Although poor fetal growth is known to have significant effects on cardiovascular risk in adulthood it remains a poorly understood and clinically heterogeneous phenomenon. This project aims to further understand the role that IGF2 and epigenetics may play in poor fetal and postnatal growth.	Medical Research Council	Fellowship	131628.0	GBP

The challenge of propagating genetic and epigenetic information is met in S phase and entails genome-wide disruption and restoration of chromatin coupled to faithful copying of DNA. How specific chromatin structures are restored on new DNA and transmitted through mitotic cell division remains a fundamental question in biology central to understand cell fate and identity.Chromatin restoration on new DNA involves a complex set of events including nucleosome assembly and remodelling, restoration of marks on DNA and histones, deposition of histone variants and establishment of higher order chromosomal structures including sister-chromatid cohesion. To dissect these fundamental processes and their coordination in time and space with DNA replication, we have developed a novel technology termed nascent chromatin capture (NCC) that provides unique possibility for biochemical and proteomic analysis of chromatin replication in human cells. I propose to apply this innovative cutting-edge technique for a comprehensive characterization of chromatin restoration during DNA replication and to reveal how replication timing and genotoxic stress impact on final chromatin state. This highly topical project brings together the fields of chromatin biology, DNA replication, epigenetics and genome stability and we expect to make groundbreaking discoveries that will improve our understanding of human development, somatic cell reprogramming and complex diseases like cancer. The proposed research will 1) identify and characterize novel mechanisms in chromatin restoration and 2) address molecularly how replication timing and genotoxic insults influence chromatin maturation and final chromatin state.

The existing improvement programmes are based exclusively on genetic markers, overlooking the fact that selection for complex traits is strongly affected by environmental conditions and that epigenetics likely account for a large proportion of the observed phenotypic variation. Non-coding RNAs (e.g., miRNAs) and cytosine methylation (5mC) and hydroxymethylation (5hmC) of DNA are key mechanisms underlying epigenetic regulation of gene expression. We have recently identified a panel of 5mCs, 5hmCs and miRNAs that are potential epigenetic markers (epimarkers) of improved growth in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). EPIMARK will evaluate the commercial feasibility of our novel kit of growth epimarkers, so that they can be applied in selective breeding programmes. This will be achieved by (i) validating the miRNA, 5mC and 5hmC epimarkers, (ii) developing an assay for their quantification, (iii) investigating the commercial and financial feasibility and (iv) developing the optimal business strategy, consolidated in a business plan. The EPIMARK kit will lead to a more efficient selection of fish in breeding programs based on growth potential, thereby increasing the profitability and sustainability of the aquaculture industry. The technology developed in EPIMARK will also open important avenues of innovation, including the use of epimarkers for selection of other superior production traits and disease resistance in Nile tilapia and in other species of commercial importance.

Overall five-year survival has remained less than 5% over the last 50 years and is the lowest of the 21 most common cancers in England. It is characterised by a dense fibrotic stroma with activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs). In addition to genetic changes, it is now increasingly recognised that epigenetic mechanisms play a major role in cancer development and drug resistance. Epigenetics can be defined as heritable changes in gene expression without a change in DNA sequence. Epigenetic control of gene expression can be via chemical alteration of the DNA (usually by methylation of cytosines) or through modifications of histones (proteins that pack the DNA into chromatin, the main component of chromosomes). Little is known about epigenetic mechanisms that are important in pancreatic cancer. The aim of this study is to identify key epigenetic drivers of chemotherapy resistance in pancreatic cancer. Using techniques to search the whole genome for histone modifications, I will study the changes in pancreatic cancer cells that show a differential response to chemotherapy. Since the tumour stroma also plays a major role in pancreatic cancer, I will also study the epigenetic mechanisms that drive the change of PSCs from a quiescent to an activated phenotype, using similar techniques as for pancreatic cancer cells. This project will provide important data to work towards our long-term aim to identify targets for novel therapeutic strategies in pancreatic cancer.

They have been shown to impact many different processes, ranging from development to organ function and carcinogenesis. Recently it has become clear that many distinct small RNA families exist. However, all act though a member of the well-conserved Argonaute family of proteins. I try to understand how specificity of the different Argonaute proteins is achieved, and I am particularly interested in Argonautes that may contribute to the epigenetic marking of genomic DNA in animals. My focus is on Argonaute function in the vertebrate germline, a tissue that is an especially intriguing system with regard to the resetting and establishment of epigenetic marks. As model system I use the zebrafish.Piwi proteins are Argonaute proteins that in vertebrates are specifically expressed in germ cells, and have been implicated in modifying chromatin structures. We demonstrated that zebrafish piwi is expressed in both the male and the female gonad and that loss of piwi results in loss of germ cells due to apoptosis. We have characterized small RNAs that bind to piwi (piRNAs) in both ovary and testis, and found that they play a role in the silencing of transposable elements. Furthermore, we have shown that the biogenesis of piRNAs differs markedly from that of other small RNAs like miRNAs.The experiments I propose address how Piwi proteins and piRNAs act in the germline to ensure a functional germline and a stable propagation of intact chromatin over generations. First, we will address the biogenesis of piRNAs. Second, we will identify novel components of the Piwi pathway. Third we will address the mode(s) of action of piRNAs. On all fronts a combination of genetics, molecular biology and biochemistry will be used.	European Research Council	Starting Grant	970000.0	EUR

It enables students to directly engage in frontier research. Participating faculty has acquired a total of 43 ERC grants in the life sciences, and VBC PhD students have co-authored milestone publications like the discovery of tracrRNA, the Cas9/CRISPR mechanism or the establishment of cerebral organoids from human pluripotent stem cells. Founded in 1993, the programme has produced a strong track record of graduates that have accepted leading positions in science, science management or private research. Moreover, the VBC PhD programme developed a thorough training and education programme that builds on the PhD curriculum for life sciences of the University of Vienna, from which students obtain their degree. Research into Stem cells and Development is one of the core research areas on the Vienna BioCenter, connecting basic research groups across the different research institutes and faculties participating in the VBC PhD programme. The proposed research in this proposal will strengthen two central research directions of this consortium: (i) The first research direction focuses on cellular programmes and aims to define the molecular mechanisms that drive stem cells to into lineage-specific programmes, or – conversely – permit differentiated cells to de-differentiate. This also includes the question how the homeostasis between stem cells and differentiated cells is regulated on the tissue level. (ii) The second research direction investigates how stem cells form whole tissues, and how this process can be recapitulated and molecularly dissected ex vivo, building on the recent breakthroughs in organoid culture and genome editing. The proposed PhD projects of the consortium match these central research directions, and take full advantage of the excellent research environment available to the students. This covers state-of-the-art facilities, including the newly founded Stem cell core facility (ISCCF) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences that will be a central player for stem cell expertise and training to the consortium. Likewise, the consortium will benefit from the association of a strong bioinformatics group providing and developing methodology for large data analyses. This will meet foreseeable challenges posed by the advent of massive parallel cellular transcriptomics and other high-throughput technologies. Finally, the students will profit from the world-class science performed in interfacing research areas, such as (i) RNA biology, gene regulation and epigenetics (ii) molecular medicine or (iii) neuroscience; and from the list of outstanding scientists that visit the campus as part of the VBC lecture series. Together, this will provide the students funded by this proposal with an excellent training and research environment in which they can mature as scientists, follow their curiosity, and contribute to original research discoveries that will break new grounds in distinct areas of stem cell research.

125	Professor Marx	Universität Konstanz	None	2014-02-01	2019-02-01	Evolved Replication Systems for Epigenetics	Cells have a broad functional and morphological diversity due to differential gene expression. Research in epigenetics combines the study of inheritable, phenotypical changes in the gene expression pattern of a specific cell type that are not caused by a transformed nucleotide sequence of the genetic code itself. Epigenetic marks are represented by a variety of molecular mechanisms including DNA methylation. Alterations of DNA methylation play a crucial role in the onset of diseases like cancer. Many DNA methylation-based biomarkers have been evaluated and the analysis of epigenetic alterations is a promising tool for disease diagnostics, prognostics, and prediction of drug response. In future, this will allow to adapt therapies to a person, which will increase the chance for successful treatments, minimizing side-effects of chemotherapy and administration of ineffective drugs and thus, prevent the onset of follow-up problems that are associated with these events. Thus, cost-effective but robust means that allow the analysis of DNA methylation-based biomarkers are of urgent need. Several methods for analysis of these biomarkers are employed. However, those that have the required resolution are laborious, time-consuming, and error-prone and thus, prevent broad applications of DNA methylation profiling in clinical diagnostics. The aim of this project is to overcome the barriers that prohibit using DNA methylation profiling in broad clinical applications for diagnostics, prognostics, and prediction of drug response. The objectives will be reached by a multidisciplinary systemic approach harnessing the power of organic synthesis (i. e. new synthetic modified nucleotides), biochemical and structural enzyme studies, and directed evolution of DNA polymerases tailored for new replication systems for epigenetics. The evolved replication systems will be superior to known techniques by superseding the bottle necks of current approaches paving the way for broad applications.

In addition, epigenetic alterations are now linked to several human diseases including cancers. A common feature of many epigenetic phenomena, for which X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) is the paradigm, is the implication of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Regulatory ncRNAs belong to 2 major classes: (i) long ncRNAs, which can be transcribed from a single strand as well as in the opposite orientation when they may overlap with either protein-coding or non-coding genes. Both sense (Xist) and antisense (Tsix) ncRNAs control the initiation of XCI; and (ii) short ncRNAs, such as si- or miRNAs, which interfere, through different pathways, with gene function.The aim of this project is to gain insights into the regulation and function of ncRNAs in the control of gene expression program, using XCI as a model system. We propose to combine molecular genetics, embryology and cell biology to (1) decipher the transcriptional control of Xist and the coordinate regulation of the Xist/Tsix sense/antisense tandem in relation to developmental programs; (2) functionally characterise a novel ncRNA on the X chromosome which nests several miRNAs and for which preliminary data suggest a role in XCI and (3) develop a system to extend our knowledge of the regulatory stages of XCI in human through the use of human embryonic stem cells.Our comprehensive analysis of the function and regulation of ncRNAs in XCI has important implications for our understanding of the numerous diseases associated with abnormal patterns of inactivation and is a critical prerequisite to any subsequent therapeutic approaches. This project is in absolute adequacy with the future Epigenetic and Cell Fate host centre co-headed by Prs. Lalande and Viegas-Pequignot, a large-scale initiative expected to strengthen French and European research in Epigenetics.	European Research Council	Starting Grant	1220000.0	EUR

We will capitalize on 25 years of studies on the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes used as a model, to focus on three objectives which will significantly increase our knowledge of the bacterium, of the cell biology of infection and of the epigenetic reprogramming upon infection. Our aims are: - at the bacterial level : to describe for the first time, the proteomic landscape of a bacterium during switch from saprophytism to virulence. We will use a proteogenomic approach together with ribosome profiling, to analyze the translation of the whole transcriptome after bacterial growth in several conditions, including in vivo, in order to barcode all the proteins which play a role in infection. This will open the way to assess the role of 1) small proteins; 2) internal translation initiation sites ; 3) the coupling of transcription and translation. - at the host cell level : To decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying the dynamics and role in infection of host intracellular organelles, starting with mitochondria. - At the host epigenetic level : To explore how the microbe reprograms host transcription and how tolerance to a commensal such as Akkermansia muciniphila differs from responsiveness to a pathogen insult, at the level of histones and mRNA modifications by studying 1) chromatin remodeling, in particular histones modifications during infection ; 2) modifications of the epitranscriptome during Listeria infection and colonization with Akkermansia ; 3) whether there is an epigenetic memory of infection and colonization. This ambitious multidisciplinary project will not only generate new concepts in infection biology but also will unravel fundamental mechanisms in microbiology, cell biology, and epigenetics opening new avenues for further research.

Its role is critical for the successful establishment and maintenance of the immune system's capacity to distinguish between vital “Self” and injurious “Non-Self”. This vital function is primarily instructed by thymic epithelial cells (TECs). Throughout life, terminally differentiated thymic cortical and medullary epithelia are replaced at a relatively high rate calling for the intra-thymic existence of a pool of precursor cells responsible for this continuous TEC turnover. However, neither the nature of the intrathymic stem/precursor cell nor the molecular mechanisms responsible for thymic organogenesis and the life-long homeostatic TEC maintenance are at present known in detail. Using integrative functional genomic analyses, the proposed research seeks to identify the molecular features that characterise thymic epithelial progenitor cells and that govern thymic tissue formation and preservation. Specifically, the chromatin modifying components Ring1A/B of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) and the function of the transcription factor Oct4 will be investigated for their role in TEC precursor biology and the phenomenon of de-differentiation of adult, respectively. Working Hypotheses: The current grant application is based on the testable hypotheses that(i)genes targeted by Ring1A/B are essential for TEC progenitor cell survival and the regular formation of their progeny; (ii) Oct4 driven de-differentiation of adult TECs to TEC precursors is dependent on the presence of Ring1A/B but can be rendered more efficiently by the absence of p53.(iii) Oct4 driven de-differentiation of adult TECs correlates with changes in histone marks, DNA methylation and microRNA expression providing insight into the mechanisms operational in TEC reprogramming.Specific Aims:#1: To determine the gene targets of Ring1A/B-mediated PRC1 function in progenitor and terminally differentiated TEC.#2: To investigate whether the effect of ectopic Oct4 expression on TEC dedifferentiation is dependent on the concomitant function of Ring1A and/or Ring1B and whether the absence of p53 impacts on the effect of Oct4.#3: To establish the gene expression profile and the epigenetic changes in TEC de-differentiation following Oct4 expression..Experimental Design and Methods:Novel transgenic mouse models combined with state of the art methods in molecular, cellular and computational biology will be used to address specific questions related to the genetic and epigenetic circuitry operational in gaining and maintaining TEC “stemness” and in the control of their differentiation. Expected Value of the Proposed ProjectInsight gained from the proposed studies will be important to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for the formation, homeostatic maintenance as well as the differentiation of thymic epithelial stem/precursor cells. This knowledge will be required to establish rational strategies for the (re)generation of functional thymic tissue to be used in specific cell therapy . These aspects are of particular relevance given the promise of embryonic stem cells (ESC) and somatic cells induced to a pluripotent state (i.e. iPS) to be utilized as a cellular source to restore thymic functions in the aged, in clinical situations of iatrogenic thymic hypoplasia/dysplasia, and in instances of congenital athymia, respectively.Keywords: Thymus organogenesis, functional genomics, epigenetics, Polycomb group proteins Ring-1A/B, Oct4, p53, thymus epithelial stem/precursor cells, (de-)differentiation,	Swiss National Science Foundation	NRP 63 Stem cells and regenerative medicine	567816.0	CHF

Epigenetics has been mostly studied in eukaryotes such as fungi, plants and humans, where it has now become evident that it plays important roles during embryogenesis, cellular differentiation, genomic imprinting and cancer development. Methylated cytosines (m5C and m4C) and adenines (m6A) are also frequently found in bacterial genomes due to the activity of restriction-modification systems acting as immigration controllers preventing horizontal gene transfers, but also of orphan DNA methyl-transferases (MTases) involved in DNA mismatch repair and/or in regulating gene expression to control a variety of processes including pathogenesis and virulence. Our previous work on the cell cycle-regulated DNA MTase CcrM that is found in most Alphaproteobacteria, has uncovered a tight connection between adenine methylation and cell cycle control in the model C. crescentus bacterium. Still, too little is known on which genes are directly regulated by DNA methylation in Alphaproteobacteria and on epigenetic regulators that can sense DNA methylation marks to modulate gene expression. The first aim of this proposal is to address this issue directly. We will use (epi)genomics and classical molecular biology methods to identify genes regulated by DNA methylation in the environmental bacterium Caulobacter crescentus and in the distantly-related Agrobacterium tumefaciens plant pathogen. We will then select the most interesting genes, preferentially regulated in a CcrM-dependent manner in all three bacteria, to identify novel and conserved epigenetic regulators in C. crescentus using forward genetics or biochemical screens. Considering that the expression of the majority of the genes suspected to be regulated by DNA methylation is cell cycle-regulated and/or encoding proteins involved in DNA metabolism in C. crescentus, we hope to uncover novel cell cycle regulators that we will characterize in more details to reveal their mechanism(s) of action and their function(s) in Alphaproteobacteria.Although DNA methylation plays important roles in so many organisms, it comes with a serious drawback: m5C can be accidentally deaminated into thymines (T). Resulting TG DNA mismatches must be corrected before they get replicated or they can turn into permanent mutations. Bacteria use Vsr endonucleases during the Very Small Patch (VSP) repair process to eliminate these mismatches but the regulation and the specificity of this process remain unclear, especially in bacteria that have multiple cytosine MTases and multiple Vsr-like proteins like C. crescentus. The second aim of this proposal is to characterize and visualize the VSP process in live C. crescentus cells using molecular genetics and state-of-the-art microscopy experiments. Considering that VSP repair also requires MutS and MutL, two proteins also involved in the repair of DNA mismatches escaping from the proofreading activity of the replicative DNA polymerase (MMR), we will study the potential competition or cooperation between MMR and VSP repair in C. crescentus cells. Defects in DNA mismatch repair are a concern for human health as they can promote the incidence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains or of several cancers and neurodegenerative diseases.

If left untreated, malaria can become life threatening and took about 627’000 lives in 2012, the majority being children and pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa. It is caused by apicomplexan parasites of the genus Plasmodium, which are transmitted by female Anopheles mosquitoes. When sexual stages of Plasmodium are taken up during a mosquito blood meal, male and female gametes fuse in the mosquito midgut to form a tetraploid zygote. The Plasmodium zygote then develops into a motile stage called the ookinete, which migrates through the mosquito midgut wall and forms an asexually growing sporulation oocyst at the basal lamina. It is known that this journey through the mosquito acts as a bottleneck in the parasite's life cycle where numbers decrease drastically. Therefore, this is a favourable stage for an intervention to take effect. In the last decade, it has become increasingly clear that epigenetic mechanisms are a very important hallmark in the parasite’s survival strategy within the human host. However, our knowledge of epigenetic orchestration of gene expression in the mosquito-stage parasites is virtually absent. Here, we will undertake a comprehensive investigation aiming to unravel the regulatory mechanisms underlying gene expression in the developing zygote/ookinete and how this might be related to the parasite transmission strategies through the vector. We believe that detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling malaria parasite development in the mosquito midgut will add substantially to the understanding of malaria transmission biology. This study will expand our understanding of epigenetics in Plasmodium sexual stages and can pave the way for the testing of epigenetic drugs towards blocking malaria transmission.

Most of them occur with no family history and no known cause. Aging is a major risk factor for most of these diseases, therefore they gain increasing attention since the life span of mankind is improving. As the causes are unknown, it is generally difficult to model such conditions in animals or cell culture to study pathogenic mechanisms or to test potential therapeutic strategies. From the central nervous system (CNS), tissue samples can only be removed when the patient reaches the end stage. Due to these difficulties, researchers started to make use of the recently developed reprogramming technology that allows reverting human skin fibroblasts to pluripotent stem cells. The generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can then be differentiated in various cell types including the ones found in the CNS. However, reprogramming erases most of the epigenetic memory that is steering the expression of genes and has been demonstrated to be directly involved in adult onset neurodegenerative diseases. Up to now, iPSC lines from patients with different neurodegenerative diseases including ALS have been produced, but once these cells are differentiated into disease relevant cell types, they mostly fail to reproduce the phenotype observed in patients.In 2011, a more direct and faster approach for the generation of neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) from mouse skin fibroblasts was published, which is presumably also leaving more of the epigenetic memory intact.In the presented study, we want to apply this approach to human skin fibroblasts from sporadic ALS patients in order to establish a rapid method to produce astrocytes and model ALS in vitro. My preliminary data demonstrate that with this method, I am able to generate ALS patient derived astrocytes. These cells convey toxicity towards motor neurons in a similar manner as primary human ALS astrocytes and ALS astrocytes derived from post-mortem spinal cord NPCs. This finding is exciting, as astrocytes derived from ALS iPS lines failed to reproduce such pathologic features in several independent laboratories. Thanks to the close collaboration with the ALS clinic at the Ohio State University Hospital, our laboratory now possesses both, iPS lines as well as fibroblasts from the same patient. Having established the direct conversion for human fibroblasts, we are now able to compare astrocytes derived by the two different methods in order to expose disease relevant differences in the transcriptome. Therefore this project is of huge interested for the ALS field, but also for a broad science community working on neurodegenerative diseases, reprogramming or differentiation and epigenetics. Finally, our findings can help to unravel potential new therapeutic targets against this devastating disease.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Fellowships for advanced researchers	None	None

Solving this issue is a fundamental challenge of evolutionary ecology with implications for applied sciences such as conservation, and agronomy. Non genetic inheritance (NGI; e.g., ecological niche transmission) is suspected to play a foremost role in adaptive evolution but such hypothesis remains untested. Using quantitative genetics in wild plant populations, experimental evolution, and epigenetics, we will assess the role of NGI in the adaptive response to selection of plant populations. The ANGI project will follow the subsequent research program: (1) Using long-term survey data, we will measure natural selection in wild populations of Antirrhinum majus within its heterogeneous array of micro-habitats. We will calculate the fitness gain provided by multiple traits and stem elongation to plants growing in bushes where they compete for light. Stem elongation is known to depend on epigenetic variation. (2) Using a statistical approach that we developed, we will estimate the quantitative genetic and non genetic heritability of traits. (3) We will identify phenotypic changes caused by fitness that are based on genetic variation and NGI and assess their respective roles in adaptive evolution. (4) In controlled conditions, we will artificially select for increased stem elongation in clonal lineages, thereby excluding DNA variation. We will quantify the non genetic response to selection and test for a quantitative epigenetic signature of selection. (5) We will build on our results to generate an inclusive theory of genetic and non genetic natural selection. ANGI builds on a confirmed expertise in selection experiments, quantitative genetics and NGI. In addition, the availability of survey data provides a solid foundation for the achievement of this project. Our ambition is to shed light on original mechanisms underlying adaptation that are an alternative to genetic selection.	European Research Council	Consolidator Grant	1999970.0	EUR

Molecular analysis is able to provide a definitive diagnosis in some patients with inherited SAID, but the results can be inconclusive or even misleading in several other cases. In daily practice, the number of patients having a clinical picture highly consistent with an autoinflammatory disease, but are orphan of a molecular characterization (undefined SAID) is still high. The main goals of the presented project are: i) to establish consensus among experts on the correct interpretation of genetic tests in accordance with available clinical criteria; ii) to improve the performance of genetic diagnosis; iii) to evaluate the impact of modifier factors in the phenotype of defined SAID, using Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) as a prototype; iv) to establish a multidimensional platform for the identification of new genes and conditions for orphan patients. This project is part of the international collaborative project INSAID. Data and information sharing among the participating groups will be facilitated by establishing a proper common database and by implementing a pilot bioinformatics platform. AIT Molecular Diagnostics will bring in their expertise in genome-wide and targeted analyses of DNA methylation, autoantibody profiling using protein-microarray technology, immune-qPCR for serum-inflammation markers and bioinformatics, to characterise undefined SAID on the epigenetic, immunomics, and inflammatory level of disease molecular pathology. The project integrates three essential ingredients i) well characterized valuable patient material, ii) state-of-the-art genomic approaches and iii) innovative functional assays, which all together are making the most promising approach for the identification of causal DNA variants, new genes and biomarkers in genetically orphan patients.

136	Professor Simon Mead	MRC Prion Unit	None	1999-04-01	2017-05-31	Genetics, Epigenetics and Bioinformatics	The MRC Prion Unit Human Molecular Genetics of Prion and Related Dementias Programme investigates why some people, but not others, get prion diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). By comparing genetic differences between people who developed CJD and healthy people we hope to identify genes that influence why particular people are more susceptible to these diseases, and use this information to better estimate public health risks and to develop new tests and treatments. We also know that the fundamental processes involved in CJD, where one of the bodys own proteins becomes misshapen and then forms large clumps of material, are very relevant to other much commoner diseases such as Alzheimers Disease. ||Evidence in support of the involvement of non- PRNP genetic factors comes in part from work with laboratory inbred mouse strains, detailed in this groups section. A small number (~5) of quantitative trait loci (QTL) responsible for determining incubation time following intra-cerebral inoculation with prions have been mapped by the MRC Prion Unit and others using different crossing strategies and prion strains. The integration of unbiased genome-wide strategies in mouse and human prion disease will be an important in the success of both programs. Our discovery research utilises recently available genome-wide genotyping technologies. We have successfully conducted a pilot genome-wide association study with EA-Affymetrix 500K arrays (Mead et al. Lancet Neurology 2009). The necessary molecular genetic, bioinformatic, and statistical genetic expertise for genome-wide association study is either available in the Unit or through collaboration. Over the next few years we expect to develop our discovery genome-wide association research in larger patient cohorts using more advanced genotyping technologies, and focus on developing cellular and animal models to test the genes identified in our discovery research. It has become increasingly apparent that neurodegenerative diseases share fundamental mechanisms involving protein misfolding, including Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons disease. It is likely that genetic modifiers of prion pathogenesis may be of broader relevance to other protein misfolding diseases, and we intend to explore these possibilities.|One of the key goals of bioinfomatics in the Unit is to identity modifier genes, pathways and mechanisms controlling prion pathogenesis. The objective of this aspect of the programme is to use computational and statistical methods for the analysis and integration of these Unit based large-scale experiments (and also externally generated data sets) and their resulting data sets, which are large, inherently noisy and do not produce necessarily clear candidates.

The epigenetic “instruction manual” is indeed complex, but a deeper understanding of mechanisms may have far-reaching implications for the early identification and treatment of disease, such as cancer. Advances in technology, and in particular low-cost high throughput DNA sequencing (HTS), have driven an explosion of nucleic-acid-based epigenetics research. Unraveling genetic and epigenetic mechanisms as they relate to development and disease will require a generation of research and a large amount of new data. As computational scientists, we will address the needs of the genome biology community, specifically targeted at quantitative HTS data (e.g. expression or enrichment levels), with a dual-pronged attack: i) we will improve existing “low-level” data analysis methods, to model and adjust for the many biases that affect these datasets; ii) we will create new, innovative “high-level” methods and software tools to assemble and interpret the multifaceted datasets, in close collaboration with researchers that collect the data and who have intimate knowledge of the biology. Specifically, we will use our expert knowledge in the analysis of count data and apply new and improved approaches to interpreting epigenomic data. Existing approaches do not account for all of the artifacts and features of real data (e.g. GC content, copy number), so there multiple situations where we can bring computational skills and experience to bear and create lasting analysis solutions.Our team of computational scientists is fully immersed in and motivated by biological investigations. The data for our proposed methodology development is being generated within the scope of existing projects and importantly, we are involved in the experimental design at an early stage. We will supplement these data with focused benchmarking exercises, to facilitate a better understanding of the data and to validate and compare new computational methods. Our proposal is methodology development, but a large amount of our research time is ultimately spent with our collaborators answering questions in a specific dataset. We do not necessarily drive those questions, but our expertise drives the method development that is fundamental to answering them.An attractive aspect of our research is that our methodological developments spread across multiple data types and biological domains. For example, statistical analyses of count data apply similarly to gene expression data (e.g. RNA sequencing), DNA methylation (e.g. affinity capture sequencing), protein-DNA interaction data (e.g. chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing), and so on, with a small amount of domain-specific tuning. Additionally, our group creates user-friendly software based on the widely-used Bioconductor project and our project will train 2 PhD students in the high-demand field of statistical bioinformatics, in a multidisciplinary data-centric setting.

Many infected individuals are not aware of the diagnosis and will become symptomatic with the advent of complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma. Despite the availability of new drugs, treatment remains challenging due to its complexity, duration, cost, toxicities and potential emergence of drug resistance.Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAs) identified polymorphisms in IL28B, a gene encoding type III interferon (IFN), as important predictors of spontaneous and treatment induced clearance of HCV, but the functional mechanisms underlying this association are still elusive and their discovery remains an exciting challenge. Furthermore, the role of such polymorphisms for infections due to viruses other than HCV has been poorly explored. Altogether, functional immunogenetics may improve our knowledge of the pathogenesis of viral infections.The project will investigate the contribution of genetics and epigenetics on HCV clearance and on other infections, including those due to the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and herpesviruses. Specifically, the project will be divided in 3 specific aims.Aim 1We will identify and characterise IL28B polymorphism(s) associated with HCV clearance as follows1.1 To identify new IL28B variants, including• Variable nucleotide tandem repeats (VNTRs)• Epigenetic variations• Large DNA deletions/insertions1.2 To determine whether these IL28B markers are better predictors of spontaneous or treatment induced HCV clearance than previously identified IL28B markers in patients from the Swiss HCV Cohort study.1.3 To determine the mechanisms by which these IL28B markers influence IL28B function, by analysing• Their quantitative impact on IL28B and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) expression.• Their interaction with potential transcriptional/regulatory factors.Aim 2Polymorphisms nearby IL28B can only explain a fraction of individual variability in HCV clearance. To complete our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of hepatitis C, we will look for polymorphisms in genes other than IL28B that further influence this phenotype as follows:2.1 To identify rare variants by full exome sequencing of extreme HCV phenotypes, selected based on unusual response patterns. Those new variants will be functionally characterised in in vitro models.2.2 To find frequent variants by using a previous GWA dataset. Candidate genes will be selected from genes identified in full exome data as well as a systematic review of the literature (previous associations and genes known to be involved in HCV immunity).Aim 3Since polymorphisms in IL28B have a strong influence on HCV clearance, we will determine whether they also influence the natural history or clinical course of infections due to other viruses including HBV, herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) in patients from the Swiss HIV and Transplant Cohort Studies. Polymorphisms in genes discovered in aim 2 will also be analysed.Preliminary resultsOur preliminary observations from HCV infected patients identified a TT/-G substitution in the CpG region of IL28B as a better predictor of spontaneous HCV clearance and response to treatment than rs8099917 and rs12979860. The polymorphism induced the methylation of the adjacent cytosine residue and is a promising target for functional investigations. RelevanceImmunogenetic studies can contribute to a better understanding of antiviral immune mechanisms and improve the prevention and treatment of severe viral infections.

The exponential growth of epigenetics and genomic data facilitates innovative approaches to investigate risk of having cancer and underlying mechanisms. As some genes play a dual role in cancer and obesity, association between cancer and obesity can be assessed. I have reported that Bitter melon possesses anti-diabetic and anti-obesity effects. Recent studies revealed its anti-tumour property. It was shown that Bitter melon decreased O6-methylguanine DNA adduct in colonic mucosa. It is hypothesized that localization of CpG island in genes and hence mechanisms could substantiate effects of Bitter melon in obesity-related cancer. Besides, maternal nutrition remodels underlying mechanism of obesity which may exaggerate the growth of tumours and then hinder treatment outcome. Genetics and epigenetics may be clues to delineate mechanisms of obesity-related cancer. The effects of diet on the obesity-cancer association could be investigated in network pathway analysis. Genetic epidemiology and artificial biological models can be established to study time-dependent effects. Having been trained in machine learning, pattern recognition, genetic epidemiology, likelihood and quantitative trait analysis, cutting edge methods could be used to further investigate these polygenic diseases.

140	Dr Mathew Coleman	University of Birmingham	None	2017-10-01	2023-09-30	Investigating the role of protein hydroxylation in cancer	Background Protein hydroxylases of the 2-oxoglutarate- (2OG) oxygenase family are emerging as important players in cancer through their regulation of epigenetics, gene expression, oxygen sensing and extracellular matrix deposition. Overall, this enzyme family remains relatively poorly characterised however, partly due to incomplete substrate assignment. A more comprehensive understanding is required in order to more fully appreciate the roles of hydroxylation in tumour biology, to accurately assign the targets of hypoxia and oncometabolites, and to promote the effective translation of 2OG-oxygenases. Aims Here we begin to help alleviate these constraints through detailed characterisation of three cancer-associated hydroxylases that, through substrate discovery, we have implicated in fundamental hallmarks of (tumour) cell biology. Methods We have developed a reliable approach for discovering substrates of protein hydroxylases. This work, together with others, has demonstrated that hydroxylation is far more common than previously appreciated. We recently applied our proteomic approach to three cancer-associated hydroxylases and identified substrates involved in important hallmarks of cancer. We will use a common workflow for studying novel hydroxylations in cancer. First, we characterise their regulation by hypoxia, oncometabolites, and hydroxylase cancer mutations. Then we investigate their roles in tumourigenesis through a combination of cell biology, proteomics and genomics approaches in a variety of models, including hydroxylase-mutant tumour cell lines and patient-derived organoids. Finally, we extend our findings into tumour samples through a combination of targeted resequencing and pathology analyses. How the results of this research will be used Importantly, although we predominantly use gastrointestinal and oncometabolite-driven cancers as models, the work will describe novel mechanisms of tumourigenesis that will likely be applicable across cancers, including those of unmet need. As such, the findings have the potential to highlight novel therapeutic opportunities and will have important implications for the successful translation of 2OG-oxygenases in cancer.

However, its functioning differs substantially between individuals. Certain people have mild or severe immune defects, which makes them prone to infections, autoimmunity and cancer. Some of these immunodeficiencies are monogenetic and relatively well understood. But in many cases the molecular cause is entirely unknown, which makes these rare diseases difficult to diagnose and treat. In this project, we will use cutting-edge multi-omics profiling and integrative bioinformatic analysis to dissect the molecular pathways underlying common variable immunodeficiency (CVID, ORPHA: #1572), an archetypical rare primary antibody deficiency (PAD) where impaired B cell function causes recurrent infections. A subset of CVID individuals (~25%) display one or several monogenetic variants known to be associated with PADs. We will use such genetically resolved cases to identify recurrent epigenomic, transcriptomic and/or proteomic aberrations underlying CVID, and we will exploit the identified patterns to improve the diagnosis, stratification and mechanistic understanding of CVID patients with unknown genetic and/or non-genetic causes. We will also include patients with selective IgA deficiency (IgAD) due to its likely role as preamble of CVID, opening up the potential for accurate molecular diagnostics and disease stratification at an early stage. In this project, key leaders in the fields of CVID, immunology, genetics, epigenetics, proteomics and bioinformatics have joined forces to provide a novel and systematic classification of CVID patients based on the molecular dissection of affected cellular pathways. Our approach will directly benefit PAD patients and provide a perspective for personalized management of PAD based on multi-omics technologies that are cost-effective and ready to be used by clinical immunology and rare diseases experts. FWF-funded contribution: Within the i-PAD project, the lab of Christoph Bock at the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases will focus on high-throughput profiling of chromatin accessibility and on the integrative bioinformatic analysis of all datasets.

In this process, one of the two X chromosomes in females is converted from an active into a clonally heritable, inactive, state during early embryonic development, to ensure dosage compensation between the sexes. This process is also remarkable in that an entire chromosome is silenced while its homologue, present in the same nucleus, remains active. Thus, in addition to being an epigenetics paradigm, XCI also represents a powerful model for monoallelic gene expression and could provide important insights into the mechanisms underlying other examples of random, monoallelic regulation. The key locus underlying the initiation of XCI is the X-inactivation centre (Xic). The Xic ensures the induction and monoallelic expression of a non-coding RNA (Xist) that is responsible for triggering chromosomal silencing in cis during development. We would like to understand the mechanisms underlying the Xic's functions and define whether other, Xic-like loci exist in the genome. Once XCI is established, the inactive state is initially reversible but becomes progressively locked in as development proceeds due to numerous epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, as well as nuclear compartmentalization and asynchronous replication. In the proposed program, we will exploit our expertise in XCI to develop new lines of research and use novel technologies to investigate monoallelic gene expression, nuclear organization and epigenetics during development. Our main objectives are (1) to understand how monoallelic expression states are established and maintained during early development and (2) to assess how chromosome dynamics and nuclear architecture can impact on these states.

143	Prof. Edith HEARD	Institut Curie	None	2015-11-01	2020-10-31	Exploring mechanisms of gene repression and escape during X-chromosome inactivation	During mammalian development, precise gene expression patterns have to be established and then maintained, or reversed, in different cellular and tissue contexts. A striking example of such developmentally regulated gene control is X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), whereby one of the two X chromosomes in females is silenced during embryogenesis. XCI is initiated by the non-coding Xist RNA, which coats the chromosome in cis, triggering gene repression, chromatin changes and chromosomal reorganisation. Although Xist’s regulation has been investigated intensively, less is known about the actual mechanisms underlying the process of chromosome-wide gene silencing that it induces. Indeed, X-linked loci show very different kinetics of repression during development, implying regional and/or locus specific diversity. Furthermore, some genes avoid or escape XCI altogether, either constitutively or in a tissue or stage-specific fashion, but the molecular basis for this is unclear. Here we propose to dissect the mechanisms underlying gene regulation during XCI. We will investigate the roles of recently identified Xist partners in gene silencing and perform genetic screens to identify new factors involved in silencing and escape from XCI. Transcription, chromatin status and chromosome conformation during XCI will be investigated in an allelic-specific manner during precise developmental time windows to pinpoint the critical changes accompanying silencing and escape. We will use genetic engineering to alter genomic and epigenomic landscapes of selected loci and target candidate trans-acting factors to their putative regulatory elements. Finally, we will develop tools to explore gene expression during XCI using live cell imaging of embryogenesis. Using this innovative set of approaches, we hope to define both general principles underlying gene silencing and escape in XCI, as well as locus-specific features that could serve as new paradigms for research in developmental epigenetics.

144	Ao. Prof. Dr. Gerda EGGER	Medical University of Vienna	None	2019-01-01	2021-12-31	Dissecting the Role of HDAC1 in T Cell Lymphoma	Histone deacetylases are important chromatin modifying enzymes that counteract histone acetyltransferases by removing acetyl groups from both histone and non-histone proteins. Removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues of core histones results in chromatin compaction and a repressive chromatin environment. Deregulation of chromatin states is frequently found in cancer and thus, HDAC inhibitors have been successfully used in cancer therapy. Several HDAC inhibitors are FDA approved and are used for the treatment of haematological malignancies including T cell lymphoma or are tested in clinical studies. HDAC1, a major family member of class I HDACs, is essential for early development in mice and its conditional deletion in different tissues impairs cellular homeostasis and proliferation. Unexpectedly, recent reports showed that reduced HDAC1 and HDAC2 levels in thymocytes could predispose mice towards lymphoma development. To study the role of HDAC1 for lymphoma development, we used a transgenic mouse model mimicking human anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Following the T-cell specific expression of the NPM-ALK oncogenic fusion protein, these mice develop mediastinal tumors at around 20 weeks of age. Intriguingly, conditional deletion of Hdac1 in T cells of these transgenic mice caused a dramatic acceleration of tumorigenesis. Based on these results we hypothesize that HDAC1 has an oncosuppressive role in early T cell development, which is different from the observed effects of HDAC inhibitor treatment of malignant cells resulting in differentiation and apoptosis of tumor cells. The proposed project aims to investigate the function of HDAC1 and a possible compensatory role of HDAC2 for oncogene driven lymphomagenesis and to compare the effects of genetic and chemical depletion of HDAC1/2 within a transgenic mouse model. Additionally, we plan to identify specific acetylation targets of HDAC1/2 on histones and non-histone proteins following Hdac1/2 knockout or pharmacological inhibition using HDAC inhibitors. The project partners will use their complementing expertise and employ next generation sequencing based techniques (e.g. RNA-Seq, ATAC-seq) as well as proteomics- in particular acetylomics- to decipher the targets and pathways affected by loss or inhibition of HDAC enzymes. Main researchers responsible for the project will be Zbynek Zdrahal, an expert in proteomics and head of the Research Group Proteomics at CEITEC (Brno, CZ) and Gerda Egger an epigenetics specialist affiliated with the Clinical Institute of Pathology of the Medical University of Vienna (AT). The results from these experiments will provide insights into the molecular alterations following loss of HDAC activity that predispose T-cells towards ALK-induced lymphoma development. They will also have direct implications for the possible incidence and evaluation of beneficial and adverse effects in HDACi therapy and will provide a molecular rationale for molecular indications and contraindications of these drugs in lymphoma treatment.

The formation of polyploid plants is often connected with transcriptional gene silencing (TGS), an epigenetic change resulting in heritable, complete loss of gene expression from previously active genes, accompanied by chemical modification of the affected DNA and its associated proteins and by structural changes of the chromatin. Epigenetics in polyploids and the underlying mechanisms are interesting in the view of basic plant biology as well as for better understanding the principles of plant breeding. Based on previous observations of polyploidy-associated transcriptional gene silencing (PA-TGS) of a resistance gene in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, this proposal suggests determining which trans- and cis- acting elements are involved in this regulation. The potentially reversible inactive marker gene allows for a selection-based identification of trans-acting factors, required for maintenance of the inactive state. The search can identify new factors as well as determine the role of already known gene products. Building on loss-of-function or over-expression of the identified molecules, it will be determined which parts of the genome are susceptible to PA-TGS. Inactive and active status of the same gene in diploid and polyploid plants will be compared for their chromatin features and permit addressing the role of chromosomal location and gene structure.

MBD2 deficient mice express inappropriately high levels of small bowel gene products from colonic mucosa, have increased susceptibility to intestinal helminth infection, a biased Th1 steady state cytokine production and aberrant antigen presenting cell (APC) priming of the adaptive immune response (See Q11). This dysregulated immune phenotype however has yet to be examined withinthe GI tract. Given the gut-lumen interface represents the most challenging perturbation to our immune system, hostenvironment interaction and altered tolerance here may offer useful insight into complex immune disease pathogenesis. By investigating MBD2 deficient mice and assessing response to intestinal inflammation, I aim to: 1. Identify key immune cell types that display a dysregulated activation phenotype in the GI tract and mesenteric lymph nodes of wild type (WT) versus MBD2 mice, in the steady stateand following induction of inflammation. 2. Assess the cytokine response in the GI tract and mesenteric lymph nodes of WT versus MBD2-/-, in the steady state and following induction of inflammation. 3. Compare the intestinal microbiome of WT versus MBD2-/- 4. Determine at a molecular level, differences in the methylation and acetylation of key genes found to be dysregulated in specific cell types in MBD2-/-. 5. Use cell specific gene targeting to assess the role of DNA methylation transcription proteins in discrete cell populations.	Wellcome Trust	PhD Training Fellowship for Clinicians	263285.0	GBP
147	Ao. Prof. Dr. Karl KUCHLER	Medical University of Vienna	None	2018-10-01	2022-09-30	Molecular and Cellular Control of Tissue Homeostasis in Health and Disease - TissueHome	The doc.funds “TissueHome” will implement a new program devoted to the competitive training of 12 PhD students in translational research, addressing fundamental questions related to molecular mechanisms of immune surveillance that maintain tissue homeostasis. A better understanding of molecular principles governing tissue homeostasis in health is needed for efficient therapeutic interventions. However, many questions concerning molecular principles of cell-cell communication, long-range immune signaling, and recruitment of effector cells to ensure normal tissue homeostasis remain open. The central hypothesis of the working program is that malregulation of complex communication signals between immune cells derange the physiological tissue control, thus promoting inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, as well as microbial infections. Thus, TissueHome will decipher how the dynamic communication between innate and adaptive immune cells at epithelial barriers shapes the immunological competence, which is required for protection against infections, autoimmune diseases but also for tolerance to commensal pathogens of the microbiome. TissueHome will address three major questions: (i) How does the dynamic cross-talk of innate–adaptive immunity engage regulatory mechanisms (chromatin modifications / epigenetics, RNA modification, (post)-transcriptional & post-translational) to establish tissue homeostasis in physiology and diseases? (ii) What are the mechanisms innate phagocytes and adaptive T cells use to communicate within microenvironments of epithelia during beneficial/detrimental tissue homeostasis? (iii) How do host-pathogen interactions of microbial pathogens with innate / adaptive immune cells shape the inflammatory response and how can hyperinflammation alter mucosal microbiomes, and how can microbiome dysbiosis promote disease susceptibility? The TissueHome faculty encompasses a team of scientists enjoying international recognition, including leading experts in immune signaling, epigenetics, RNA modification, fungal infectious diseases, autoimmune disesase, molecular medicine, animal genetics, cellular and molecular immunology, host-pathogen interactions, systems biology, gene regulation and bioinformatics. The faculty members have competitive track records in both research and training of PhD students. The TissueHome training will entail state-of-the art methods, including genomic and genetic technologies, next generation sequencing technologies, high-end imaging, animal models and mouse genetics, and immune cell technologies to decipher the molecular mechanisms orchestrating tissue barrier function. The added value of TissueHome is reflected by the integration into the existing MFPL PhD program, with reciprocal benefits due to interdisciplinarity and translational approaches taken by TissueHome, but also by a new and timely topic introduced into the MFPL PhD program. Another added value is that each main aim will be addressed by two to three PhD students through hypothesis-driven collaborative projects. Taken together, TissueHome will (i) offer PhD students to work on interdisciplinarity / translational projects of medical relevance in excellent research environments, (ii) provide a stimulating international environment for research and transferable skills training, and (iii) prepare the PhD students for a successful career in academia, industry or in science-related sectors.

148	Dr. Ruben GUTZAT	Gregor Mendel Institute	None	2018-01-01	2020-12-31	AUgmented REsilience After Transmission of Epimutations	During the past decade, tremendous progress has been made in our understanding of molecular mechanisms as well as genetic variation that underlie the adaptation of plants to fluctuating environments. The established view is that genetic and epigenetic factors interact to create specific transcriptional responses that help plants to cope with harmful environments. Of particular interest is the response of plants to repeated episodes of the same stress, and there is no doubt that epigenetic memory within the same generation plays an important role in acclimating or priming plants for subsequent exposure to the same stress. We are, however, only beginning to understand how such epigenetic memory is first created and then maintained. In addition, our knowledge of how and how quickly induced epigenetic changes are reset remains inadequate. In AUREATE, we will use the model plant Arabidopsis to gain insights into whether and how vegetative and stem cells differ in their acquisition and maintenance of epigenetic memory, using state-of-the-art methods for cell-type specific analyses. Since transposable elements are a major force shaping the distribution of epigenetic marks along the genome, and at the same time represent the most variable components of genomes, we will examine a range of genetically diverse strains in order to pinpoint the role of transposable elements in differential epigenetic memory. Next, as a first step towards understanding how epigenetic memory can be passed on to the next generation, we will reveal the mode of transmission of newly acquired epigenetic information from germline stem cells in the shoot apical meristem to gametes. In the course of these studies, we will have identified specific regions of the genome that are sensitive to epigenetic modification upon stress, reveal which ones are stable or reset during germline development, and which ones are stable or vary during evolution. Using genetics and targeted epigenome modification, we will then begin to reveal the underlying mechanisms responsible for epigenetic memory. In summary, the outputs of AUREATE will provide a deeper understanding of transgenerational memory in plants and its potential application to enhance stress resilience in economically important plant species. This project unites four experts in plant genomics, epigenomics, stem cells and sexual reproduction with complementary expertise. Prof. Detlef Weigel (Max Planck Society) is an expert in the genome and epigenome analyses of natural strains. Prof. Ueli Grossniklaus (University of Zurich) is an expert in developmental genetics and female gametogenesis. Dr. Jose Gutierrez-Marcos (University of Warwick) is an expert in sexual plant reproduction and epigenetics.

149	Dr. Etienne Bucher	University of Basel	Botanisches Institut Universität Basel	2011-02-01	2014-01-31	Investigating the tissue specific epigenetic code in plants	Epigenetics encompasses a variety of molecular mechanisms that provide an additional layer of information superimposed on the genetic code. These mechanisms are conserved among eukaryotes and enable mitotic and meiotic inheritance of gene expression states. This characteristic plays an important role in specification and maintenance of cell fate. Epigenetic repression of transcription also plays an essential role in suppressing transposon activity, which could otherwise have deleterious effects on the host organism (Mirouze et al, 2009). This transcriptional repression can bring endogenous genes under epigenetic control when transposons integrate in their vicinity. This type of regulation of gene expression is very general and has been observed in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Weil & Martienssen, 2008). Furthermore, epigenetic control of gene expression has been shown to play an important role in cancer (Davalos & Esteller, 2010). The plant Arabidopsis thaliana has proven to be an ideal organism to study how epigenetic control of gene expression works at the molecular level. This is due to the fact that complete removal of certain epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation, is not lethal in plants, while it is in mice for instance (Jones & Takai, 2001). This allowed the detailed study of a remarkable example of epigenetic memory, which involves the propagation of DNA methylation patterns in plants through cell division. In recent years mutant screens have identified numerous factors involved in maintenance and initiation of epigenetic codes (Matzke et al, 2009). In this way much general knowledge has been acquired about the role of epigenetic control of gene expression at the organism level. While there are some reports proposing a tissue specific epigenetic code in plants (Caro et al, 2007; Costa & Shaw, 2006) this has so far not been investigated systematically.The aim of this project is to gain understanding on how epigenetic states are set up and maintained in differentiated plant organs (such as roots, leafs, flowers and stems), individual tissues and cell lineages. In order to address this, Arabidopsis will be used as an established model system that has excellent genetic tools available. The project will be based on an essential, epigenetically controlled and highly tissue specific reporter transgene in Arabidopsis. The reporter construct contains the promoter of the aforementioned essential gene that also includes part of a transposon. Recent data suggest that by crossing transgenic plants containing this reporter construct into epigenetic mutants, the tissue specificity of the reporter transgene can be changed. In order to identify novel epigenetic factors that control tissue specific gene expression, these plants have been mutagenized and are currently being screened for new expression patterns. So far, 38 putative mutant plants with 8 different expression patterns have been identified. Interestingly, most mutants show strong developmental defects, indicating that important developmental factors are involved. The project will focus on screening for more mutants and mapping mutations to identify the genes involved. Developmental and molecular characterisation of mutants will be carried out using state of the art technologies such as transcription profiling based on tiling arrays, genome wide DNA methylation analysis of individual tissues and biochemical approaches. This research project will give fundamental insights into the mechanisms of epigenetic coordination of development and the role of transposons in this process.

A biological function for lncRNAs was first proposed when the RNA molecules H19 and Xist, lacking protein-coding sequences, were discovered. Although Xist lncRNA was shown to be essential for X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), suggesting a role in chromatin regulation, the precise mechanism remained unknown. This function in chromatin regulation was confirmed later when Hotair and Xist lncRNAs were shown to recruit the PRC2 complex, inducing heterochromatin formation at the HoxD locus and of the whole X-chromosome, respectively. Additional lncRNAs were then sporadically identified and proposed to play different functions, often linked to epigenetic mechanisms. Ultimately, the development of next-generation sequencing and tiling arrays technologies greatly facilitated the identification of lncRNAs. The development of new techniques, combined with functional genomics, resulted in the identification of a large number of lncRNA species and their assignment to different biological functions, but functions have been addressed only for a minority of lncRNAs. Thus, the challenge is now to understand if and how the large number of lncRNAs regulates chromatin structure and gene expression. In the examples studied, lncRNAs often play the role of a scaffold to hold protein complexes together or a recruiting platform to target proteins to specific gene loci. However, how these interactions are regulated and the protein partners bound by the lncRNAs remain largely unknown.I propose to tackle these questions combining genetic approaches and state-of-the-art proteomics analysis. In the Lee Lab, I will address an open question in epigenetics - how X-chromosome inactivation is regulated in mammals. Aside from dissecting the mechanism of X-chromosome inactivation regulation, this research project should shed light on general lncRNA biology. Identifying lncRNA-binding partners will allow to elucidate their mechanisms of action and to test these mechanisms by targeted experiments. Thus, I anticipate this study will help defining the modes of action of lncRNAs, aiming at better understanding how lncRNAs shape our genome.

Many infected individuals are not aware of the diagnosis and will become symptomatic with the advent of complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma. Despite the availability of new drugs, treatment remains challenging due to its complexity, duration, cost, toxicities and potential emergence of drug resistance.Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAs) identified polymorphisms in IL28B, a gene encoding type III interferon (IFN), as important predictors of spontaneous and treatment induced clearance of HCV, but the functional mechanisms underlying this association are still elusive and their discovery remains an exciting challenge. Furthermore, the role of such polymorphisms for infections due to viruses other than HCV has been poorly explored. Altogether, functional immunogenetics may improve our knowledge of the pathogenesis of viral infections.The project will investigate the contribution of genetics and epigenetics on HCV clearance and on other infections, including those due to the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and herpesviruses. Specifically, the project will be divided in 3 specific aims.Aim 1We will identify and characterise IL28B polymorphism(s) associated with HCV clearance as follows1.1 To identify new IL28B variants, including• Variable nucleotide tandem repeats (VNTRs)• Epigenetic variations• Large DNA deletions/insertions1.2 To determine whether these IL28B markers are better predictors of spontaneous or treatment induced HCV clearance than previously identified IL28B markers in patients from the Swiss HCV Cohort study.1.3 To determine the mechanisms by which these IL28B markers influence IL28B function, by analysing• Their quantitative impact on IL28B and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) expression.• Their interaction with potential transcriptional/regulatory factors.Aim 2Polymorphisms nearby IL28B can only explain a fraction of individual variability in HCV clearance. To complete our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of hepatitis C, we will look for polymorphisms in genes other than IL28B that further influence this phenotype as follows:2.1 To identify rare variants by full exome sequencing of extreme HCV phenotypes, selected based on unusual response patterns. Those new variants will be functionally characterised in in vitro models.2.2 To find frequent variants by using a previous GWA dataset. Candidate genes will be selected from genes identified in full exome data as well as a systematic review of the literature (previous associations and genes known to be involved in HCV immunity).Aim 3Since polymorphisms in IL28B have a strong influence on HCV clearance, we will determine whether they also influence the natural history or clinical course of infections due to other viruses including HBV, herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) in patients from the Swiss HIV and Transplant Cohort Studies. Polymorphisms in genes discovered in aim 2 will also be analysed.Preliminary resultsOur preliminary observations from HCV infected patients identified a TT/-G substitution in the CpG region of IL28B as a better predictor of spontaneous HCV clearance and response to treatment than rs8099917 and rs12979860. The polymorphism induced the methylation of the adjacent cytosine residue and is a promising target for functional investigations. RelevanceImmunogenetic studies can contribute to a better understanding of antiviral immune mechanisms and improve the prevention and treatment of severe viral infections.

152	Dr. Thomas KRAUSGRUBER	Austrian Academy of Sciences	None	2018-04-01	2020-03-31	Systems-level analysis of the T-bet interaction network	SYSTEMS-LEVEL ANALYSIS OF THE T-BET INTERACTION NETWORK CD4+ T helper (Th) cells differentiate into a number of effector types and this specialization is governed by lineage-defining transcription factors that activate signature-associated gene programs for a given cell fate. The transcription factor T-bet is crucial for the induction of the Th1 gene profile but also essential for repressing genetic programs associated with alternative lineage decisions through mechanisms that remain elusive. To understand Th1 cell differentiation, we need to establish a quantitative and genome-wide understanding of gene activation and gene repression controlled by T-bet. This proposal hypothesizes that the opposing regulatory functions of T-bet are mediated by DNA-context-dependent recruitment of specific cofactors. A T-bet centered protein interaction network would thus control the activity of key regulatory regions and thereby regulate the phenotypic features associated with Th1 cells. Here, I am proposing to use system-wide proteomics coupled with functional studies to pursue the following three aims: Aim 1: Establish the chromatin-dependent interactome and regulome of T-bet Using MS-ChIP-seq technology I will simultaneously characterize protein-protein interactions in the chromatin and T-bet binding sites throughout the genome. This method integrates mass spectrometry and ChIP-seq into a single protocol, thereby overcoming several limitations of more classical interaction proteomics. Using MS-ChIP-seq in combination with bioinformatic modeling, I will establish a T-bet-centric regulatory network underlying Th1 cell differentiation. Aim 2: Test the functional relevance of T-bet cofactors I will employ CROP-seq as a powerful and efficient assay for the functional evaluation of cofactors identified in Aim 1. This approach will distinguish strong candidates from bystanders and technical artefacts, thereby establishing a detailed inventory of the proteins that T-bet employs to establish a functional Th1 cell state. Aim 3: Functionally validate key cofactors of T-bet-mediated cell state control I will devise a bioinformatics prioritization scheme of T-bet interactors that integrates regulatory network models (Aim 1) and the high-throughput functional assay (Aim 2). I will functionally dissect three strong candidates and validate the precise role of these proteins in T-bet-mediated Th1 cell differentiation, with the perspective of establishing new targets for immunomodulatory therapy. The project will be carried out in the laboratory of Dr. Christoph Bock (CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna) which will bring together my skills in molecular and phenotypic immune cell profiling and his expertise in epigenetics and large-scale date analysis. Successful completion of the proposed project will advance the state-of-the-art in T cell biology by addressing fundamental questions about how T-bet establishes stable cell states and how manipulation of the T-bet regulatory network could be harnessed to selectively change cellular identity.

153	Dr. Akihisa OSAKABE	Austrian Academy of Sciences	None	2018-08-01	2020-07-31	A mechanism of histone exchange involved in heterochromatin	Chromatin is divided into two major types of compartments, euchromatin, active domains comprising expressed genes, and heterochromatin, more condensed inactive regions enriched in silenced genes, repeats and transposons. Several feedback loops involving non-coding RNA, H3K9 methylation and DNA methylation have been implicated in maintaining heterochromatin. In contrast, mechanisms leading to de novo establishment of heterochromatin remain less well understood. The lab of Dr. Frederic Berger identified a histone variant, H2A.W, which is restricted to heterochromatin in the model plant Arabidopsis and involved in heterochromatin compaction. Unpublished data indicate that this variant participates in heterochromatic silencing. However, the mechanism dedicated to the specific deposition of H2A.W in heterochromatin is still unclear. In this project, the applicant Dr. Akihisa Osakabe identified a specific chromatin remodeler, which appears to be responsible for exchanging H2A.Z for H2A.W. He proposes to study the properties of this remodeler and to question if it is involved in the establishment of heterochromatin in Arabidopsis. Preliminary biochemical characterization of the remodeler has been obtained by Dr. Osakabe and unpublished data shows that in absence of the remodeler, heterochromatin loses H2A.W, which is replaced specifically by H2A.Z but not the canonical histones H2A nor H2A.X. Using his extensive expertise in histone biochemistry, Dr. Osakabe will use in vitro assays to characterize the properties of this remodeler and identify the protein domains responsible for its specific affinity for H2A.Z and H2A.W. He will use the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha to assess the degree of evolutionary conservation of the remodeling activity. In planta experiments and genetic complementation in Arabidopsis and Marchantia will accompany the biochemical studies and allow further dissection of the functional domains. Studies of mutant lines using RNA-seq and chromatin profiling will further assess the genome-wide impact of this remodeling activity on the heterochromatin landscape and on silencing of genes and TEs. In summary, it is expected that the proposed work will characterize the biochemical properties and mechanism of a novel type of chromatin remodeler, the deposition of H2A.W and its targeting to heterochromatic domains. This mechanism likely represents one of the primary events that establishes heterochromatin de novo and is expected to make a profound impact in the field of epigenetics and chromatin biology. Dr. Akihisa Osakabe will be the primary researcher in the project in the host laboratory of the co-applicant Dr. Frederic Berger, located in the Gregor Mendel Institute and supported by excellent infrastructure for the proposed work.

154	Dr. Gian Gaetano Tartaglia	FUNDACIO PRIVADA CENTRE DE REGULACIO GENOMICA	None	2013-01-01	2018-01-01	The Role of Non-coding RNA in Protein Networks and Neurodegenerative Diseases	A major portion of the eukaryotic genome is occupied by DNA sequences whose transcripts do not code for proteins. This part of the genome is transcribed in a developmentally regulated manner and in response to external stimuli to produce large numbers of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). From the beginning of transcription through splicing and translation, RNA molecules are associated with numerous RNA binding proteins that regulate their processing, stability, transport and translation. Both coding and non-coding RNAs and their associated binding proteins are involved in numerous cellular pathways. These pathways, which include RNA processing and the regulation of transcription and translation, are critical determinants of neuronal differentiation and plasticity. Alterations in these pathways have been identified to contribute to a wide variety of neurodegenerative diseases. Mutations in two RNA binding proteins involved in RNA splicing, the Tar DNA binding protein of 43kd (TDP-43) and Fused in Sarcoma (FUS), cause amyloid aggregation and are associated with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). My main interest is to understand the role played by RNA molecules in protein networks. Characterizing protein-RNA associations is key to unravel the complexity and functionality of mammalian genomes. In this project, I propose to study associations of lncRNAs with proteins involved in i) transcriptional regulation and epigenetics (such as polymerases, transcription factors and chromatin-modifiers) and ii) neurodegenerative diseases (such as Parkinson’s -synuclein, Alzheimer’s disease amyloid protein APP, TDP-43 and FUS). In particular, I will investigate if RNA molecules are involved in regulatory mechanisms that control protein production and prevent formation of toxic aggregates. In a multidisciplinary effort, I aim to discover protein-RNA interactions using advanced computational methods developed in my group and state of the art experimental techniques.

Epigenetics, the study of heritable changes in gene function occurring without a change in the DNA sequence, is a major new field in life sciences. Drosophila has led the way with work starting almost a century ago with position-effect variegation (PEV), a phenomenon of mosaic expression of genes relocated near heterochromatin by a chromosomal rearrangement. Genetic modifiers of PEV have identified essential components of heterochromatin-induced epigenetic silencing as predicted by Reuter and Spierer (1992). We have molecularly identified a number of modifiers of PEV and devoted a lot of work to one of them SU(VAR)3-7. We have revealed that SU(VAR)3-7 participates with other partners in the building of heterochromatin resulting in gene silencing. We have characterized its function by analysing the phenotypes of Su(var)3-7 mutation and over-expression in soma, dissected the different domains of the protein and described its implication in heterochromatin formation as well as it requirement for proper dosage compensation. We plan to pursue our study of SU(VAR)3-7 function with different partners in different pathways. We will also examine the function of the protein in the gonads, find its genomic targets and its interactors particularly in germ cells. In parallel, we will study methyltransferases responsible of H3K9 methylation, as we have produced essential tools, notably null mutations of dG9a and DmSetDB1 by homologous recombination.Aim 1: Exploring transposable elements as targets of SU(VAR)3-7 in heterochromatin. We have found that SU(VAR)3-7 controls the activity of a number of transposable elements (TEs). We plan to describe the effects of Su(var)3-7 mutations on TEs silencing, and the subsequent effects on their transposition. We plan to unravel the mechanisms of action by examining the expected physical association of the protein on TEs and its possible role controlling this part of the genome potentially detrimental. Finally, we showed genetic interaction between Su(var)3-7 and the small interfering RNAs pathways. It is of importance to study the link between the function of SU(VAR)3-7 and the role of small RNAS in genomic silencing, and the implication of other Su(var) genes in TEs silencing. Aim 2: Exploring the role of SU(VAR)3-7 and its heterochromatic partners in gonads. After a comprehensive analysis of SU(VAR)3-7 physiology in the soma, we plan to describe in details the phenotypes of Su(var)3-7 mutations in gonads, among them an unsumoylable SU(VAR)3-7, notably on chromosome integrity and inheritance, oocyte differentiation, genomic silencing, and regulation of TEs activity. We will expand our study to other factors of the chromatin as the H3K9 HMTase dG9a and DmSETDB1 and other Su(var) genes. Aim 3: Analyzing the function of DmSETDB1. We will describe in details the function of DmSETDB1 in the female gonad and test the effect of its targeting to specific promoters. In parallel, we will study the post-translational ubiquitination of DmSETDB1 and characterize its partners. DmSETD1 appears as an important chromatin regulator, and the work in progress should unravel a comprehensive picture of the mechanisms and targets of silencing.Expected Value. We will demonstrate the importance of several actors of gene silencing in epigenetic control of gene expression, in the regulation of TEs, and in chromosome integrity and segregation at mitosis and meiosis. We want to foster this analysis with a special emphasis on the female gonad. In addition to contributing to the expanding field of epigenetics in biology and human diseases, we expect that our work will bring novel understanding on the so far poorly explored role of epigenetic mechanisms in germline differentiation.

Today, the fundamental difference between the detection of proteins and that of DNA is that, for each protein and each modification, an individual reagent has to be separately generated and validated, while for DNA, synthetic oligonucleotides give access to a completely generic detection technology, using only four building blocks, known complementarity rules and automated chemical synthesis. The grand ambition of this Sinergia project is to create a similar, completely modular detection technology for polypeptides as well. This will require that a peptide (e.g., from an unstructured region of a protein, a denatured form of the protein or proteolytic digest) bind to a modular counterpart. Armadillo repeat proteins provide the basis for such a binding mode of a peptide. Over the first term of this grant, four strong teams of scientists, all located at the University of Zurich, closely collaborated bringing together complementary expertise in protein engineering to initiate this project: evolutionary engineering, NMR, X-ray crystallography and structure-based computation. This unique interdisciplinary collaboration has resulted in remarkable progress in this challenging endeavor, (i) having allowed to determine several crystal structures of consensus Armadillo repeat proteins with important feed-back for further design, (ii) solved many of the NMR assignment problems of these challenging repeat proteins, (iii) introduced many essential design proposals through computation and (iv) verified these proposals experimentally, including selecting a first peptide binder from a designed library.This project will be continued, exploiting the technical progress that has been made. Through the engineering of highly 'crystallizable' fusion proteins, a more rapid feedback from the effect of mutations on the structure and that of the bound peptide will be obtained. Through the completion of the NMR assignment, rapid information on the location of the bound peptide will be obtained. Computation will be crucial to test ideas for modifications in the structure or of the binding pockets. Great progress in setting up high-throughput display technologies and novel systems will allow an experimental approach to the fine-tuning of the building blocks.We believe that this project, once completed, may have significant effect on future research in cell biology. Regarding first applications, we will focus our efforts on posttranslational modifications, such as site-specific and protein-specific detection of phosphorylation and histone modifications.As has been shown in the last phase, the participating students and postdoctoral fellows, which take active parts in very frequent common progress meetings, are exposed to first-hand accounts of a wide range of different state-of-the-art technologies relevant in modern protein science, and have thus greatly profited from this interdisciplinary research approach to protein engineering.

Maternal malnutrition in pregnancy is associated with offspring growth restriction and increased risk of the offspring developing metabolic disease in adulthood. In mice, maternal malnutrition causes a lifelong change in the epigenetic state of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and altered transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). These epigenetic changes were restricted to a subset (40-60%) of the hundreds of rDNA copies within the genome of an individual. Further analysis suggests that this epigenetic effect alters which genetically distinct variants of rRNA are expressed. Despite a striking quantitative correlation between growth restriction and rDNA epigenetic silencing, a mechanistic link between this epigenetic programming and phenotype is yet to be established. I propose to develop a tractable mammalian cell model to address what the downstream consequences of perturbing rRNA production are for ribosome composition. First, I will generate cell lines that recapitulate natural genetic variation at rDNA. These will be modified to inducibly over-express an epigenetic modifier that specifically targets rDNA. After optimisation of this system I will determine how modifying rDNA epigenetics influences the rRNA composition of ribosomes. Variation in the rRNA composition of ribosomes alters protein translation fidelity in a range of non-mammalian model organisms. The model proposed here will be used to address the hypothesis that epigenetic programming of rDNA, via altering ribosome composition, has consequences for ribosome function thereby modifying fidelity or other aspects of protein translation. This novel mechanism of regulating genomic output may account for the mechanism by which compromised fetal development increases adult metabolic disease risk.

Epigenetic changes seem to have a crucial role in pathways leading from early-life nutrition to metabolic health across the life course. NutriPROGRAM will study key maternal and infant nutrition-related exposures in relation to DNA methylation in mothers and offspring at different ages, and metabolic health outcomes across the life course. It will involve: (1) integrating sets of early-life nutritional factors in mothers and infants; (2) observational and intervention studies across the life course on metabolic outcomes including longitudinal growth and fat development, advanced imaging for body fat, metabolomic profiles and clinical outcomes; (3) cause-and-effect relationships of DNA methylation in the associations of nutrition-related factors and metabolic outcomes across the life course, by advanced causal inference approaches; (4) modification of DNA methylation changes by nutrition, lifestyle, physical activity and microbiota; (5) functional consequences of differences in DNA methylation using RNA expression and tissue specific approaches; and (6) translation into preventive or population-health strategies. NutriPROGRAM will capitalize on rich, existing and complementary nutritional, metabolic and epigenetic datasets from observational and intervention studies in pregnancy, childhood and adulthood, together covering the full life course. It will use knowledge and data infrastructures from different collaborative consortia including the Horizon2020 DynaHEALTH and LifeCycle Projects, the ERA-HDHL ALPHABET project, and the Pregnancy and Childhood Epigenetics (PACE) Consortium. Eventually, NutriPROGRAM will develop a sustainable, translational, international collaboration for current and future studies on nutrition and epigenetics and their role in sustaining good health throughout the lifecourse.

159	Dr Natalie Shenker	Imperial College London	Surgery and Cancer	2019-05-01	2023-04-30	Maximising the public health impact of a human milk bank	Human milk is hugely complex, containing thousands of factors that guide development, protect babies from infections, and train their immune system to recognise harms. Breastfeeding also gives major health benefits to mothers, but these are largely unknown and unexplained. Furthermore, human milk banks, which provide screened donated breast milk to sick infants when a mother's milk supply is insufficient, have been restricted in recent decades, meaning donor milk is now rationed to only the most preterm babies. The UK has no dedicated centre of research into human milk, and few centres in the world focus on the maternal health impact of breastfeeding. Having founded the first independent non-profit human milk in the UK 2 years ago, I have laid the groundwork to launch an innovative programme of three research projects, each of which will lay the foundations for a larger body of impactful research and clinical advances. The three projects are summarised: 1: Genetic mutations are known to cause breast cancer (e.g. BRCA1 mutations), but much less is known about the epigenetic risk. Epigenetics describes the modifications to DNA that regulate how much of the DNA is turned into proteins. Epigenetic patterns are tissue-specific, so patterns detected in breast cells are different to other tissues such as blood. Previous research, including our own work, has identified epigenetic patterns of breast cancer risk in the DNA of blood DNA. We have found evidence that different cancer risk factors, such as smoking, alcohol and BMI, influence these patterns. However, it is difficult to extrapolate these findings to breast tissue. Breast milk contains a large number of cells from the lining of the breast ducts that are the same cell type that may develop breast cancer. Many of the molecular changes that cause breast cancer may occur long before the cancer has developed and may be detectable in these cells. First, I will recruit more subjects into our research cohort to reach a minimum of 300 subjects. We will assess known epigenetic markers of risk including aging, smoking, alcohol and BMI. This project will provide evidence of early changes in normal breast cells and provide important biological insights into how these increase risk. Finally, this work will provide the evidence needed to create a large study of milk from 20,000 women to develop new cancer screening tests. 2: The World Health Organisation recommends children are breastfed for at least 2 years, but only tiny amounts of data exists on the composition of human milk beyond 6 months. We will recruit 45 mothers to give samples of milk every 3 months over at least 2 years, and profile each sample for the 1000s of fatty acids to understand how milk composition changes, if at all. This information will guide milk donor recruitment, address the value of breastfeeding beyond 6 months, and inform future studies of targeting donor milk for babies with specific nutritional needs. 3: Babies born just a few weeks prematurely, so-called late preterm babies, have a higher risk of death and ill health than full-term babies. They are often a good weight and mostly do not need help with breathing, but still have subtle problems. One of these problems is a lower chance of establishing breastfeeding. Extremely premature babies who receive only mother's milk or donor milk do better in both the short- and long term compared to those who receive formula. Mothers whose babies receive donor milk see it as a 'bridge' to expressing or breastfeeding. We will recruit 120 babies and mothers born late preterm and randomise them to receive donor milk compared to formula with lactation support to assess whether this helps mothers to establish breastfeeding. The three questions addressed in this Fellowship aim to help improve the UK's breastfeeding rates, which have been among the worst in the world for more than two decades. This Fellowship presents a unique opportunity to drive change.	Medical Research Council	Fellowship	954821.0	GBP

It is widely recognised that pregnant mothers can influence the health and characteristics of their children via non-genomic "maternal effects", but there are still gaps in our understanding regarding causality and the range and mechanism of effects. Consequently, current public health advice for women who are pregnant or looking to conceive can be inconsistent, misleading and often based on the precautionary principle rather than robust, empirical evidence of causation. Additionally, there is increasing evidence that fathers can also exert "paternal effects" on the health of their unborn children, but very little advice is currently offered to fathers-to-be. This research will address an urgent unmet need to better understand how both maternal and paternal health behaviours in the prenatal period influence offspring health outcomes. The four specific research questions are: 1) Which prenatal maternal and paternal health behaviours associate with offspring outcomes? 2) Which of these associations are causal? 3) How do maternal and paternal influences interact or mediate each other? 4) What are the underlying molecular mechanisms? The project uses existing questionnaire and 'omics data (therefore representing excellent value-for-money) from six major European birth cohorts, focusing on parental exposures that might be considered modifiable (smoking, alcohol, physical activity, diet) and offspring outcomes spanning three domains of child development (anthropometry/adiposity, neurodevelopmental/psychosocial, congenital anomalies) as well as potential molecular mediators (DNA methylation, metabolites). Evidence garnered using different state-of-the-art epidemiological approaches will be triangulated to help identify and refine causal pathways. Findings will identify the most appropriate prenatal targets (mothers, fathers or both parents) for public health advice to improve offspring outcomes.

In the mammalian embryo, pluripotency is a transient property that disappears as cells sequentially specialise into differentiated tissues or soma. However, a small number of primordial germ cells (PGCs) are set-aside in early development and are the founder cells of the germline, ultimately giving rise to the gametes – the sperm and egg. Despite the overt specialisation displayed by sperm and egg, it is through combining these two cell types that a new embryo, once again containing pluripotent cells, is produced in the next generation. Furthermore, PGCs are the cells of origin of testicular teratocarcinoma and when placed in culture, in the presence of certain cytokines, they can efficiently undergo conversion to pluripotent stem cells called embryonic germ (EG) cells. These cells have similar properties to embryonic stem (ES) cells derived directly from pluripotent cells in the early embryo. Therefore we have hypothesised that competence for pluripotency appears to persist – to a lesser or greater extent - throughout the germline cycle. Our lab studies the germline cycle in vivo in mammalian embryos, and also in vitro using primary culture systems and pluripotent stem cell models. By studying how pluripotency is regulated both in vivo (predominantly in the mouse) and in vitro (using mouse, rat and, increasingly, human cells) we seek to answer basic questions about the regulation of cell fate and potency. We are also interested in how germ cell development is co-ordinated with the major germline epigenetic reprogramming events, with a particularly focus on DNA methylation. We have started to develop live imaging approaches to visualise germ cells in vivo and in vitro, and we hope to use this to answer a broad range of questions including: how developmental signals influence cell potency and epigenetic processes, the role of physical factors on germ cells and the molecular mechanism of PGC migration. By studying basic questions in stem cell biology, developmental biology, epigenetics and reproduction we hope to inform the treatment of human infertility, such as by in vitro gametogenesis approaches, and more broadly impact the field of regenerative medicine. Understanding the process of teratocarcinogenesis may well inform our understanding of developmental tumours. Understanding how normal development is subverted and how aberrant cells survive and lead to tumours has the potential to impact strategies to improve treatment strategies.

162	Dr Kevin Mills	University College London	Institute of Child Health	2016-04-18	2019-04-17	JPND coFUND ADAGE	UCL has recently developed a multiplexed, MRM-based UPLC-MS/MS assay for the simultaneous quantitation of 27 biomarkers in 100 ul of CSF in under 10 min (figure below). Using this assay in the analyses of CSF, it was possible to distinguish correctly between patients with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer Disease, Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) and age-matched controls (figure 2 and 3). This test was developed on a triple quadrupole based mass spectral platform which allows the translation of this test into any large hospital. Preliminary metabolomic profiling of CSF in the UCL laboratories have identified potential biomarkers and differences in metabolite expression in patients with Lewy Body Dementia, Parkinson's Disease and age-matched controls (Figure below). These results indicate that there are changes in the metabolome and potentially the lipidome (brain is 60% lipid) of patients with neurodegenerative conditions. Cutting edge 'omic' techniques, a full translational test capability and well defined clinical patient samples included in WP3, will allow us to identify new biomarkers, potential disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative conditions. Ageing, Single-Carbon Metabolism, and Total Brain Atrophy in Non-Demented Elders: Ageing (table 1a), hyperhomocysteinemia (>10.53)(table Xb), and low folate (<18.67)(table xc) increase risk for total brain atrophy (Bowman et al., 2012; Bowman et al., 2013). Virtually all brain regions atrophy with age and these structural changes increase risk for cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. These data suggest that single-carbon metabolism has a role in brain aging.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	315263.0	GBP

My group has significantly contributed to this novel research field. It is however fair to say that the role of “epigenetics” in memory function is still met with some skepticism in the neurosciences, which is in part due to the fact that many of the current studies have been describing phenomena and mechanistic data to explain how epigenetic processes control memory function in health and disease are comparatively sparse. The major objective of this research proposal is to address this issue and help to consolidate the field of neuroepigenetics by providing insight to the mechanisms by which epigenetic processes contribute to memory formation under physiological and pathological conditions. More specifically I will ask how the epigenetic code is translated into cellular changes that mediate memory formation in health and disease and how can epigenetic mechanisms contribute to the transmission of cognitive phenotypes even across generations. Our results will not only provide import insight to the mechanisms that underlie memory formation but will also lay the basis for the development of novel and improved therapies for age-related cognitive disorders.

164	Dr Nicholas Fuggle	University of Southampton	MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit	2019-08-06	2021-08-05	Does epigenetic age acceleration predict future accelerated musculoskeletal ageing?	Background The ability to predict those at risk of adverse musculoskeletal ageing is vital if therapeutic strategies are to be successful (Kern et al., 2005). Therefore, the identification of biomarkers that capture ‘biological’ age have the potential for significant clinical utility. Epigenetic changes, specifically those within the DNA methylome, enable precise age prediction (Teschendorff et al., 2010, Rakyan et al., 2010) and ‘epigenetic clocks’ have been formulated to capture ‘biological’ ageing (Horvath, 2013). The objectives of my fellowship are: Primary aim: • To describe the longitudinal associations between epigenetic age acceleration at baseline, and musculoskeletal outcomes 10 and 17 years later. Secondary aims: • To establish the association between baseline epigenetic age acceleration and the 10 and 17 year incidence of fractures and falls. • To identify novel epigenetic patterns and individuals marks which are associated with indices of bone and muscle ageing through Epigenome-Wide Association Study. Methods My fellowship will focus on the Hertfordshire Cohort Study (HCS); a group of community-dwelling, older adults. The musculoskeletal phenotyping of the cohort I completed in 2017 included questionnaires, short performance physical battery testing, dynamometry, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), High Resolution pQCT which provided longitudinal measures of phenotyping which was performed in 2011-12. These two time-points will be used to assess the relationship between epigenetic age at baseline (1998-2001) and musculoskeletal phenotype at approximately 10 years (2011-12) and approximately 17 years (2017). DNA samples derived from whole blood leukocytes at HCS baseline (1998-2001) will be assessed for genome-wide methylation profiles (Pidsley et al., 2016). I will use epigenetic clocks (Horvath, 2013, Hannum et al., 2013) to calculate epigenetic age and age acceleration. These will be compared with musculoskeletal outcomes. In additional, exploratory analyses, I will use an epigenome-wide approach to elucidate specifc CpGs, differentially-methylated regions of interest, and patterns of CpG methylation associated with musculoskeletal outcomes. Impact The findings from this study will contribute significantly to the understanding of the relationship between epigenetics and future musculoskeletal phenotype. This will pump-prime future, post-fellowship work to investigate whether our findings are replicated in other ageing cohorts and will ultimately lead to a novel tool which incorporates epigenetic and clinical parameters to predict those at risk of adverse musculoskeletal ageing. This tool has the potential to significantly improve the predictive value of currently available tools and thus enable health resources to be targeted to those older persons with the greatest need.

These disorders are incurable and their underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Intriguingly, varying symptom severity has been described in patients with the same causative mutations for a number of these disorders and phenotypes displayed in some mouse models are strain-dependent. To search for secondary mutations that suppress phenotypes in mouse models of the neurological disorder, Rett syndrome, Monica Justice’s lab performed a genome-wide screen by inducing random mutations with the chemical mutagen ENU. I aim to take advantage of recent advances in CRISPR/Cas9 technology to develop a CRISPR-based screening method. This method will simplify isolation of modifying mutations, greatly reduce the number of animals required and can be adapted for recessive screening. I will use this method to screen for suppressors of two neurological disorders that are predicted to be modifiable: ATR-X and ADNP syndromes. Both causative genes encode epigenetic proteins: ATRX is a chromatin remodelling ATPase and ADNP is a putative transcription factor. I hope that the ‘hits’ obtained in these screens will help us to better understand ATRX/ADNP protein function and open up therapeutic avenues for patients.

Musculoskeletal ageing places older individuals at an increased risk of falls, fractures, and higher consequent morbidity and mortality. Recent developments in the field of epigenetics have led to the development of epigenetic clocks which provide a measure of biological age. The relationship between rates of biological ageing (as measured by these clocks) and future musculoskeletal phenotype and consequent risks of fractures and falls is not known. The aim of this study is therefore to investigate the association between epigenetic age acceleration at baseline and areal bone mineral density, bone microarchitecture, grip strength and physical performance and the incidence of falls and fractures at two future time points (approximately 10- and 17- years).

In contrast, small molecules and cellular metabolites are generally considered to passively enter the nucleus from the cytoplasm and to lack distinct subnuclear localization. The CHROMABOLISM proposal challenges this assumption based on preliminary data generated in my laboratory. I hypothesize that chromatin-bound enzymes of central metabolism and subnuclear metabolite gradients contribute to gene regulation and cellular identity. To address this hypothesis, we will first systematically profile chromatin-bound metabolic enzymes, chart nuclear metabolomes across representative leukemia cell lines, and develop tools to measure local metabolite concentrations at distinct genomic loci. In a second step, we will then develop and apply technology to perturb these nuclear metabolite patterns by forcing the export of metabolic enzymes for the nucleus, aberrantly recruiting these enzymes to selected genomic loci, and perturbing metabolite patterns by addition and depletion of metabolites. In all these conditions we will measure the impact of nuclear metabolism on chromatin structure and gene expression. Based on the data obtained, we will model for the effects of cellular metabolites on cancer cell identity and proliferation. In line with the recent discovery of oncometabolites and the clinical use of antimetabolites, we expect to predict chromatin-bound metabolic enzymes that can be exploited as druggable targets in oncology. In a final aim we will validate these targets in leukemia and develop chemical probes against them. Successful completion of this project has the potential to transform our understanding of nuclear metabolism in control of gene expression and cellular identity.

Though management of high glucose levels at this late stage of pregnancy is a routine practice, it does not abolish the risk to the mother and the baby. Our project aims to detect women at higher risk of GDM early in pregnancy by studying DNA methylation changes as potent biomarkers.

They are mostly based on DNA methylation and post-transcriptional histone modifications associated with transcriptional suppression that are self-sustaining once they have been deposited on a chromatin domain. Current research is unraveling the composition and function of the molecular machineries recruited to chromatin to induce these repressive states, and the mechanisms that once established support their stability and conservation through cell generations. We are interested in developing a new approach to exogenously induce the assembly of such complexes at a predetermined locus of the genome and usurp its transcription suppressive activity to permanently silence gene with a negative role in human disease. The advantage of such “epigenetic” therapy would be that it does not require introducing mutations or breaks in the DNA, as it occurs with current approaches based on integrating vectors or engineered nucleases, thus potentially providing for a much safer strategy. Moreover, the hit and run nature of an epigenetic silencing induction complex lends itself to transient delivery of Artificial Transcriptional Repressors (ATRs), engineered protein made up of an effector repressive domain fused with an artificially redirected DNA binding domain specific for the target gene. We will model this approach in human cell lines and test its feasibility in clinically relevant human primary Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor cells carrying within the genome reporter cassettes engineered with multiple binding sites for ATRs. Once we have establishes a proof-ofprinciple of the approach we will explore its efficiency on a human genetic disease.	Telethon Italy	HSR-TIGET Grant Award	297358.28	EUR
171	Daniel Cortazar	University of Oslo	University of Oslo	2012-07-01	2013-12-31	Modulation of Epigenetic Phenotypes by Oxidative DNA Damage Repair	SummaryThe DNA of eukaryotic genomes is constantly damaged by agents damaging nucleotide bases by oxidation, alkylation or deamination, thus altering their base-pairing properties and the structure of the DNA duplex. Base excision repair (BER) is the predominant pathway to resolve these otherwise mutagenic, cytotoxic and genome-destabilizing base lesions, thereby maintaining the chemical integrity of DNA and protecting cells from a rapid decay of genetic information. BER is initiated by DNA glycosylases that specifically recognize and excise base lesions, thus generating an abasic site, which is further processed by downstream BER factors to restore the original base pair. Although DNA glycosylases are perfectly equipped to support genome integrity through DNA repair, accumulating evidence supports their involvement not only in genome, but also in epigenome maintenance. We have shown recently for the first time that one DNA glycosylase, Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG), is involved in safeguarding the functional integrity of gene regulatory regions by selectively binding to CG-rich DNA regions which are known for their involvement in the regulation of many genes. Specifically, the structural properties of TDG to recruit chromatin modifying enzymes and its DNA repair function mediated by its glycosylase activity cooperatively contribute to the establishment and maintenance of proper epigenetic states during embryonic development. Recent evidence supports an effect of oxidative DNA damage and its repair on the modulation of epigenetic states, i.e. a function beyond mere DNA repair. Yet, it is not known, whether DNA glycosylases repairing such lesions are involved in such modulations through their structural and/or enzymatic properties. Aim of the prosed project is to investigate this problem for the NEIL superfamily of DNA glycosylases. Cell biological, biochemical and structural experiments with NEIL enzymes as well as preliminary behavioural studies with NEIL deficient mice indicate that this family of DNA glycosylases might have this suspected function, i.e. to actively and specifically control epigenetic states. To this end, I will investigate the role of oxidative base damage and its repair initiated by NEIL DNA glycosylases in modulating epigenetic phenotypes. I will make use of NEIL knockout mice available in the host laboratory to investigate the impact of NEIL deficiency on neurodegeneration induced by oxidative DNA damage and on subsequent neurogenesis. I will examine single, double and triple NEIL mutant mice for alterations in gene expression patterns in an attempt to correlate them with changes in the chromatin status, using chromatin and DNA immunoprecipitation techniques. Advanced DNA sequencing should further reveal NEIL function in regulating differentiation-associated gene expression programs through the repair of oxidative base lesions.With classical biochemical and proteomics approaches I aim to investigate the mechanisms governing NEIL dependent epigenetic control and will address the contribution of structural and catalytic properties of NEIL proteins on genome and epigenome maintenance. I expect that his study will provide novel insights into the function of DNA repair in modulating the interaction between environmental signals, genetics and epigenetics to ultimately contribute to proper organismal development.

This led to independent research programs with little interactions between them. However, increasing evidence suggests that key features of the metabolic syndrome are due to a pathologic activation of the immune system. This holds true e.g. for impaired insulin secretion and action in patients with type 2 diabetes. Strikingly, some features of the metabolic syndrome persist after loss of body weight and are even transmitted vertically, pointing to a genetic or epigenetic basis.Beyond these chronic pathological aspects, the immune system may also play a role in the physiologic regulation of metabolism. In support of this notion, we observed in preliminary studies that insulin stimulates IL-1ß production selectively in M1 polarized macrophages via glucose uptake and the NLRP3 inflammasome. In this same setting an increased uptake of glucose in lymphocytes was also observed.The metabolic repertoire of immune cells dictates their function. Nutrient channels, activity of metabolic pathways, metabolic checkpoint kinases, and the regulation and epigenetic architecture of genes involved in metabolism together define the immune-metabolic repertoire. Its remodeling in activated immune cells sustains increased cellular bioenergetic requirements. Beyond ATP, however, we, and others, recently identified important non-bioenergetic functions of metabolic adjustment in immune cells, operative e.g. via epigenetic and post-transcriptional mechanisms.Here we propose to link metabolism (Marc Y Donath), immunology (Christoph Hess) and epigenetics (Renato Paro) to test the hypothesis that an 'obesity-diabetes milieu' affects and imprints macrophage- and T cell-functions in a time-graded manner. We will comprehensively define how acute vs. chronic nutritional stress impacts (i) the metabolic repertoire, (ii) function and (iii) the epigenetic landscape of innate and adaptive immune cells; and assess mechanisms of reversibility of epigenetic marks imprinted by over-nutrition.

Such plasticity or potency is essential to form multiple cell types upon differentiation. In mammals, upon fertilization and fusion of the gametes -two highly differentiated cells- intense chromatin remodeling and epigenetic reprogramming, the reversion into an undifferentiated state, are essential to restore full developmental potency (totipotency). Subsequent development and differentiation are accompanied with progressive loss of plasticity. The transition between totipotency and the gradual loss of plasticity is thought to be regulated by yet-unknown epigenetic mechanisms.The embryonic chromatin displays unique features compared to differentiated cells, including the lack of ?conventional' heterochromatin. We hypothesise that the transition from a totipotent state to a differentiated one is regulated by changes in chromatin states, particularly by de novo acquisition of heterochromatin domains.This project is designed to reveal the nuclear foundations of totipotency by determining the molecular mechanisms underlying the establishment of heterochromatin and their functional role in maintaining totipotency using the mouse embryo as model.We will do this by:i)determining the functional relationship of heterochromatin and nuclear architectureii)by determining the effects of artificially inducing heterochromatin on cell potency during development andiii)by determining the mechanisms that regulate heterochromatin formation in the embryo.We anticipate that our studies will unravel fundamental mechanims on how chromatin states regulate cell potency during reprogramming. By uncovering such mechanisms, we expect to reveal new insights that will be useful to induce epigenetic reprogramming of differentiated cells. Our results will therefore lead to key contributions in the fields of stem cell, developmental biology, human reproduction, chromatin biology and epigenetics.

Three types of epigenetic alterations are currently believed to be causally implicated in providing cancer cells with the ability to drive tumor growth and progression, namely DNA methylation, chromatin remodelling as a result of covalent histone modifications and non-coding RNAs, particularly microRNAs (miRNA). Precise understanding of such mechanisms may help identify a set of targets for the development of new therapeutic strategies.The cancer stem cell (CSC) model was revived in recent years with the notion that a tumor initiating cell acquires increased self-renewal capacity through genetic mutations and epigenetic modification, maintaining the tumor drive indefinitely. CSC express various embryonic stem cell genes, including CD133, often used a stem cell marker. CSC are capable to reproduce the original tumor in vivo upon injection in immunocompromised mice, thereby giving birth to heterogenous cell subpopulations, composed of CSC as well as more differentiated progeny. As they are more prone to chemotherapy resistance, it can be conceived that targeting and eradicating CSC may lead to cure of cancers in which CSC provide the driving force for growth and progression.In the case of Ewing’s sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT), a group of rare but highly aggressive tumors arising in mesenchymal tissue in children and young adults, conventional chemotherapies are not sufficient to effectively treat patients and prevent relapse, primarily due to early metastasis. 85% of ESFT present a single mutation, the translocation t(11;22), leading to the formation of an aberrant fusion protein EWS-FLI1.The epigenetic state of primary cells is believed to determine whether they may or may not be permissive for oncogene-induced transformation. Thus, in depth understanding of epigenetically regulated cell permissiveness for oncogene expression and the mechanisms that regulate epigenetic changes upon transformation are key steps toward developing rational mechanism-based targeted anti-cancer therapies.The aim of my project will be to further investigate the role of epigenetics in regard to EWS-FLI1 by identifying and characterizing CSC and exploring how epigenetic alterations lead to their emergence and direct their tumor initiating and metastasis promoting properties.1- Determination and analysis of ESFT cells signature epigenetic profile.First, I will describe the epigenetic profile of spherogenic and adherent ESFT cells. I will address the epigenetic markers changes between the more tumorigenic sphere-forming cells and the adherent cells by focusing on histone methylation and acetylation.2- Determination of chromatin modification in CD133+ versus CD133- cells.Secondly, I will determine chromatin modifications in CD133+ versus CD133- cells. These cells will be isolated from fresh human tumor samples or from ESFT propagated in immunocompromised mice. I will also assess the influence of human versus murine microenvironment on CD133+ epigenetic markers.3- Assessment of epigenetic changes that underlie cell permissiveness for EWS-FLI1 expression and function.Finally, as EZH2 has been shown to facilitate EWS-FLI1 expression in fibroblasts, I will perform RNA-seq gene expression comparison between cells transduced with EZH2 and their control counterparts. I will then perform ChIP-seq on both sets of fibroblasts to identify EZH2-induced chromatin mark changes and correlate them with gene expression data. Selected genes could be tested for responsibility in blocking or enhancing permissiveness for EWS-FLI1 expression.The major contribution of this work will be to assess epigenetic differences between fresh primary tumor initiating and non-tumorigenic bulk tumor cells in ESFT. Such a study has never been done in part because of the paucity of primary tumor samples and in part because of the challenge of nano-ChIP-seq technology. My host lab provides me with the possibility to overcome both obstacles as it possesses and continues to obtain primary ESFT samples and has established nano-ChIP-seq technology. In addition, the project will assess the effect of in vitro culture and mouse propagation on CSC and non-CSC ESFT populations, which is a central issue toward understanding how well cultured tumor cells and tumor cells grown in mice represent the corresponding fresh primary cells. Finally, the project will define the epigenetic events that convert a non-permissive to a permissive cellular environment for EWS-FLI-1 expression and function, which will provide important and long sought insight into the pathogenesis of ESFT.

Genetic factors contribute to the risk of DKD. If we could identify these genetic factors, we could better understand the mechanisms by which DKD occurs, and thereby accelerate the development of better therapies. We established the GENIE consortium, a collaboration between Queen's University Belfast, University of Dublin, University of Helsinki, and the Broad Institute. Together, we completed the largest genetic study to date of DKD, and successfully identified the first two robust genetic risk factors for DKD. In a separately funded genetic study, we are collaborating with additional groups to extend our efforts and encompass larger samples. To better understand the underlying biology and pathophysiology of DKD, we propose to complement and build on our past and ongoing genetic studies in several critical ways. We will leverage a co-funding mechanism between Ireland, Northern Ireland and the US to carry out a multidisciplinary investigation of DKD. We will assemble and jointly analyze all available genetic data pertinent to DKD, to begin the process of discovering rarer variants with stronger effects on DKD. We will also generate DNA methylation data in kidney and blood, and in patients with and without DKD, and also expression data in samples relevant to DKD. We use a novel and powerful method to integrate the genetic, epigenetic and genomic data to generate hypotheses about the biological causes of DKD, and test these hypotheses with further genetic studies (sequencing in a large follow-up sample) and with functional studies in models of DKD. This international, multidisciplinary collaboration will build on genetic discoveries to help decipher the underlying biology and pathophysiology of DKD and thereby guide the prevention and treatment of this important disease.

Indeed progress in understanding tumorigenesis mechanisms has proved its therapeutics potential, yet most of them remained elusive or unknown. The research plan presented here is in line with this ongoing effort, proposing to explore promising new mechanisms in tumorigenesis using cutting edge technologies. Cancer cells are characterized by the presence of genetic and epigenetic alterations that lead to loss of cell identity, uncontrolled cell proliferation, cell invasion and metastasis. However, upstream events that drive the appearance and selection of these alterations remain poorly understood. Past two decades has revealed the key function of epigenetics mechanisms in maintaining cell identity and genome stability whereas their corruption is a hallmark of tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Epigenetic information relies on a combination of DNA modifications, nucleosomes positioning and modification, and many proteins that define, maintain and functionally translate this information. Therefore to maintain cell identity, faithfully duplication and transmission of epigenetic information to daughter cells is as important as duplication and transmission of the genetic information. However, little is known about how the epigenetic information is propagated during the cell cycle and recent findings raise the question of its potential implication in tumorigenesis. In S phase, the progression of DNA replication forks provokes a genome-wide disruption of the epigenetic information. This proposal aims to reveal how cells restore epigenetic information after DNA replication and to explore the interplay between these mechanisms and tumorigenesis. To this end, I will combine Nascent Chromatin Capture (NCC), a technology for purification of newly synthetized chromatin that I have developed, with mass spectrometry, high-throughput microscopy and screening technologies in normal and cancer cells. Newly identified players that are subjected to deregulation in cancer will be next characterized in order to understand their role in cancer development and their therapeutic potential.

Circadian, ~24 hour rhythms are emerging as important novel regulators of immune cell migration and function, which impacts inflammatory diseases such as myocardial infarction and sepsis. Altering leukocyte tissue infiltration and activation at the proper times provides an option for therapy that would maximize the clinical impact of drugs and vaccinations and minimize side effects. We aim to create a four-dimensional map of leukocyte migration to organs in time and space and investigate with epigenetics techniques the molecular mechanisms that regulate cell-type specific rhythms. We will functionally define the daily oscillating molecular signature(s) of leukocytes and endothelial cells with novel proteomics approaches and thus identify a circadian traffic code that dictates the rhythmic migration of leukocyte subsets to specific organs under steady-state and inflammatory conditions with pharmacological and genetic tools. We will assess the impact of lineage-specific arrhythmicities on immune homeostasis and leukocyte trafficking using an innovative combination of novel genetic tools. Based on these data we will create a model predicting circadian leukocyte migration to tissues. The project combines the disciplines of immunology and chronobiology by obtaining unprecedented information in time and space of circadian leukocyte trafficking and investigating how immune-cell specific oscillations are generated at the molecular level, which is of broad impact for both fields. Our extensive experience in the rhythmic control of the immune system makes us well poised to characterize the molecular components that orchestrate circadian leukocyte distribution across the body.

Age related conditions in adults often find their origin in risk factors operative in early life. The molecular mechanisms behind these phenomena remain largely unknown. Mitochondria are involved in a variety of critical cell functions, including oxidative energy production and programmed cell death. Recently, I established in a study of 175 newborns, a strong association between mitochondrial DNA content and in utero exposure to particulate air pollution. Telomere length is highly heritable and erosion leads to an increasingly vulnerable structural integrity of the chromosomes. It is considered a marker of overall biological age compared with chronological age. In this regard, I demonstrated the heritability of telomere length and the influence of smoking on telomere erosion. These results support the ENVIRONAGE hypothesis, i.e. that environmental inputs influence biomolecular markers of ageing including mitochondrial function, telomere length along with DNA repair and epigenetics as the ‘core axis of ageing’. The aim is to establish prospective epidemiological evidence for molecular mechanisms or early biomarkers, which may underlie the origins or reflect the risk of age-related diseases and to understand its association with other processes and the influence of environmental factors. To this end, I will establish a birth cohort and a cohort in middle-aged and elderly. I measure environmental pollutants, in interaction with parameters that I consider to have an important role in the ageing process (mitochondrial function, telomere length, epigenetics and DNA repair capacity). ENVIRONAGE integrates environmental influences and molecular mechanisms on ageing. The common molecular epidemiological strategies in newborns, middle-aged and elderly to unravel the environmental influence on ageing are groundbreaking.

The evolutionary history of protists is closely connected to the evolution of the eukaryotic cell itself. However, most protist diversity is still genomically unexplored, limiting our investigation of eukaryotic evolution. For example, while the importance of lateral gene transfer (LGT) in prokaryotic evolution is well recognized, its role in eukaryotic evolution is still debated. In addition, although epigenetic mechanisms represent a hallmark of eukaryotic genome regulation, we know surprisingly little about the evolution of these mechanisms across eukaryotic diversity. The overarching goal of my project is to understand how epigenetic mechanisms and LGT have shaped the macroevolution of eukaryotic genomes. This project has several inter-related intermediate objectives, which each in themselves will bring crucial insights into eukaryotic evolution: 1) reconstructing a robust phylogeny of eukaryotes; 2) inferring the gene content of the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor; 3) tracing the evolution of genes involved in epigenetic mechanisms and obtaining epigenomic maps from under-studied protists; 4) investigating the intriguing hypothesis of a possible interplay between epigenetic regulation and horizontal gene transfer and its influence on eukaryotic genome evolution: Have genes involved in epigenomic mechanisms been transferred between eukaryotes? Do epigenomic modifications affect the frequency of LGT in different lineages? To achieve this, I will characterize the transcriptomes, genomes, methylomes and small RNAs of understudied eukaryotic microbes selected for their key phylogenetic position, and to analyse them using state-of-the-art bioinformatic methods. I will target uncultivated protists, using single-cell techniques and novel genome-scaffolding approaches.	European Research Council	Starting Grant	1499945.0	EUR

Although epigenetic changes, and in particular of DNA methylation (DNAm), have been linked with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, with findings opening novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets, they have not been studied in DLB. This pilot study aims to explore the role of neuronal DNAm changes in DLB by combining laser-capture microdissection (LCM), for isolation of specific neurons affected by pathology, with genome-wide DNAm analysis using reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS). Our hypothesis is that DLB pathogenesis is associated with distinct epigenetic changes that can help to identify therapeutic targets. We also hypothesise that neurons bearing Lewy body pathology have a specific epigenetic signature compared to unaffected ones. To address our hypotheses this pilot project aims to: 1. Optimize and test the methodology for LCM of specific neurons from post-mortem brain suitable for DNAm analysis. 2. Combine LCM with RRBS for neuronal methylomic profiling of DLB cases and matched controls 3. Compare methylomic profiles of affected by Lewy Body pathology neurons with unaffected neurons within each individual 4. Identify methylation quantitative trait loci in DLB by combining methylomic profiling with available genomic data 5. Associate methylation changes with ante-mortem cognitive and neuroimaging data The analyses will focus both on known risk genes that have been previously linked with DLB (e.g SNCA) and on genome-wide analyses for identification of novel targets. Data gathered from this project will be the basis for future larger scale work.	The Academy of Medical Sciences	None	29668.0	GBP

This part of the genome is transcribed in a developmentally regulated manner and in response to external stimuli to produce large numbers of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). From the beginning of transcription through splicing and translation, RNA molecules are associated with numerous RNA binding proteins that regulate their processing, stability, transport and translation. Both coding and non-coding RNAs and their associated binding proteins are involved in numerous cellular pathways. These pathways, which include RNA processing and the regulation of transcription and translation, are critical determinants of neuronal differentiation and plasticity. Alterations in these pathways have been identified to contribute to a wide variety of neurodegenerative diseases. Mutations in two RNA binding proteins involved in RNA splicing, the Tar DNA binding protein of 43kd (TDP-43) and Fused in Sarcoma (FUS), cause amyloid aggregation and are associated with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). My main interest is to understand the role played by RNA molecules in protein networks. Characterizing protein-RNA associations is key to unravel the complexity and functionality of mammalian genomes. In this project, I propose to study associations of lncRNAs with proteins involved in i) transcriptional regulation and epigenetics (such as polymerases, transcription factors and chromatin-modifiers) and ii) neurodegenerative diseases (such as Parkinson’s -synuclein, Alzheimer’s disease amyloid protein APP, TDP-43 and FUS). In particular, I will investigate if RNA molecules are involved in regulatory mechanisms that control protein production and prevent formation of toxic aggregates. In a multidisciplinary effort, I aim to discover protein-RNA interactions using advanced computational methods developed in my group and state of the art experimental techniques.

Functional interactions between distal regulatory elements and target promoters require mutual physical proximity, which is linked to the three-dimensional structure of the chromatin fiber. Chromosome conformation capture studies revealed that chromosomes are partitioned into Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), sub-megabase domains of preferential physical interactions of the chromatin fiber. Genetic evidence showed that TAD boundaries restrict the genomic range of enhancer-promoter communication, and that interactions between regulatory sequences within TADs are further fine-tuned by smaller-scale structures. However, the mechanistic details of how physical interactions translate into transcriptional outputs are totally unknown. Here we propose to explore the biophysical mechanisms that link chromosome conformation and long-range transcriptional regulation using molecular biology, genetic engineering, single-cell experiments and physical modeling. We will measure chromosomal interactions in single cells and in time using a novel method that relies on an enzymatic process in vivo. Genetic engineering will be used to establish a cell system that allows quantitative measurement of how enhancer-promoter interactions relate to transcription at the population and single-cell levels, and to test the effects of perturbations without confounding effects. Finally, we will develop physical models of promoter operation in the presence of distal enhancers, which will be used to interpret the experimental data and formulate new testable predictions. With this integrated approach we aim at providing an entirely new layer of description of the general principles underlying transcriptional control, which could establish new paradigms for research in epigenetics and gene regulation.

It proposes new formal models and a systematic agenda to empirically test hypotheses that link developmental biology, epigenetics and adult human illness, disability and mortality. We seek to break new ground developing innovative formal models for illnesses and mortality, testing new hypotheses about the evolution of human health and, to the extent permitted by findings, reformulating standard theories to make them applicable to a less restrictive segment of populations than they are now. Over the past two decades there has been massive growth of research on the nature of delayed adult effects of conditions experienced in early life. This field of research is known as the Developmental Origins of Adult Health and Disease (DOHaD). Increasing evidence suggests that the mechanisms that are implicated are epigenetic and constitute an evolved adaptation selected over thousands of years to improve fitness in changing landscapes. The emergence of DOHaD is as close as we will ever come to a paradigmatic shift in the study of human health, disability and mortality. The most tantalizing possibility is that advances in our understanding of epigenetic mechanisms will shed light on pathways linking early exposures and delayed adult health thus fundamentally transforming our understanding of human illnesses and, in one fell swoop, bridge population health, epigenetics, and developmental and evolutionary biology. The overarching goal of this project is to contribute to this nascent area of study by (a) proposing new formal demographic models of health, disability and mortality; (b) empirically testing DOHaD predictions with population data; (c) testing a microsimulation model to verify DOHaD predictions about two conditions, obesity and Type 2 Diabetes, and (d) assessing the adult health, disability and mortality toll implicated by relations between early conditions, obesity and T2D.

Enhancers, regulatory elements that direct spatiotemporal gene expression, are the most variably methylated regions in the genome, but the functional consequences of these alterations are not known. Enhancer DNAme has been associated with both gene repression and gene activation, but the majority of studies are correlative or focus on single loci and a systematic analysis is currently lacking. I aim to use a novel reporter-screen based approach together with cutting-edge (epi)genomics approaches (capture Hi-C, ChIP-seq, RNA-seq) to determine whether DNA methylation affects (1) enhancer activity and (2) enhancer-promoter looping interactions in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). I will determine the functional effects of enhancer methylation using in vitro differentiation assays and by generating chimeric embryos. Genome wide methylation will be perturbed using DNA methyltransferase knockout cells whilst locus-specific manipulation will be achieved using epigenetic editing techniques (dCas9-TET1 fusion proteins). The proposed research will generate valuable datasets for the fields of epigenetics and development and the principles discovered will be applicable to developmental biology and other scenarios where DNAme is substantially altered, including cancer and aging.

It is widely recognised that pregnant mothers can influence the health and characteristics of their children via non-genomic "maternal effects", but there are still gaps in our understanding regarding causality and the range and mechanism of effects. Consequently, current public health advice for women who are pregnant or looking to conceive can be inconsistent, misleading and often based on the precautionary principle rather than robust, empirical evidence of causation. Additionally, there is increasing evidence that fathers can also exert "paternal effects" on the health of their unborn children, but very little advice is currently offered to fathers-to-be. This research will address an urgent unmet need to better understand how both maternal and paternal health behaviours in the prenatal period influence offspring health outcomes. The four specific research questions are: 1) Which prenatal maternal and paternal health behaviours associate with offspring outcomes? 2) Which of these associations are causal? 3) How do maternal and paternal influences interact or mediate each other? 4) What are the underlying molecular mechanisms? The project uses existing questionnaire and 'omics data (therefore representing excellent value-for-money) from six major European birth cohorts, focusing on parental exposures that might be considered modifiable (smoking, alcohol, physical activity, diet) and offspring outcomes spanning three domains of child development (anthropometry/adiposity, neurodevelopmental/psychosocial, congenital anomalies) as well as potential molecular mediators (DNA methylation, metabolites). Evidence garnered using different state-of-the-art epidemiological approaches will be triangulated to help identify and refine causal pathways. Findings will identify the most appropriate prenatal targets (mothers, fathers or both parents) for public health advice to improve offspring outcomes.

The challenge of propagating genetic and epigenetic information is met in S phase and entails genome-wide disruption and restoration of chromatin coupled to faithful copying of DNA. How specific chromatin structures are restored on new DNA and transmitted through mitotic cell division remains a fundamental question in biology central to understand cell fate and identity.Chromatin restoration on new DNA involves a complex set of events including nucleosome assembly and remodelling, restoration of marks on DNA and histones, deposition of histone variants and establishment of higher order chromosomal structures including sister-chromatid cohesion. To dissect these fundamental processes and their coordination in time and space with DNA replication, we have developed a novel technology termed nascent chromatin capture (NCC) that provides unique possibility for biochemical and proteomic analysis of chromatin replication in human cells. I propose to apply this innovative cutting-edge technique for a comprehensive characterization of chromatin restoration during DNA replication and to reveal how replication timing and genotoxic stress impact on final chromatin state. This highly topical project brings together the fields of chromatin biology, DNA replication, epigenetics and genome stability and we expect to make groundbreaking discoveries that will improve our understanding of human development, somatic cell reprogramming and complex diseases like cancer. The proposed research will 1) identify and characterize novel mechanisms in chromatin restoration and 2) address molecularly how replication timing and genotoxic insults influence chromatin maturation and final chromatin state.

They are mostly based on DNA methylation and post-transcriptional histone modifications associated with transcriptional suppression that are self-sustaining once they have been deposited on a chromatin domain. Current research is unraveling the composition and function of the molecular machineries recruited to chromatin to induce these repressive states, and the mechanisms that once established support their stability and conservation through cell generations. We are interested in developing a new approach to exogenously induce the assembly of such complexes at a predetermined locus of the genome and usurp its transcription suppressive activity to permanently silence gene with a negative role in human disease. The advantage of such “epigenetic” therapy would be that it does not require introducing mutations or breaks in the DNA, as it occurs with current approaches based on integrating vectors or engineered nucleases, thus potentially providing for a much safer strategy. Moreover, the hit and run nature of an epigenetic silencing induction complex lends itself to transient delivery of Artificial Transcriptional Repressors (ATRs), engineered protein made up of an effector repressive domain fused with an artificially redirected DNA binding domain specific for the target gene. We will model this approach in human cell lines and test its feasibility in clinically relevant human primary Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor cells carrying within the genome reporter cassettes engineered with multiple binding sites for ATRs. Once we have establishes a proof-ofprinciple of the approach we will explore its efficiency on a human genetic disease.	Telethon Italy	HSR-TIGET Grant Award	297358.28	EUR

Despite dramatic progress in epigenetics during the past decade, DNA demethylation remains one of the last big frontiers and very little is known about it. DNA demethylation is a widespread phenomenon and occurs in plants as well as in animals, during development, in the adult, and during somatic cell reprogramming of pluripotency genes. The molecular identity of the DNA “demethylase” in animal cells remained unresolved and has hampered progress in the field for decades. In 2007 we published that Growth Arrest and DNA Damage 45 a (Gadd45a) is a key player in active DNA demethylation, which opened new avenues in the study of this elusive process. The goal of this project is to further analyze the mechanism of DNA demethylation as well as the role played by Gadd45 in development. Given the many unresolved questions in this burgeoning field, our work promises to be ground-breaking and therefore have a profound impact in unraveling one of the least understood processes of gene regulation. Specifically we will address the following points. I) The biological role of Gadd45 mediated DNA demethylation in mouse embryos and adults is unknown. We have obtained mouse mutants for Gadd45a,b, and g and we will analyze them for developmental defects and dissect the methylation regulation of relevant genes. II) The targeting mechanism by which Gadd45 is binding to and demethylating specific sites in the genome is a central unresolved issue. We have identified a candidate DNA binding protein interacting with Gadd45 and we will analyze its role in site specific targeting of DNA demethylation in vitro and in mouse. III) We found that Gadd45 is an RNA binding protein and we will therefore analyze how non-coding RNAs are involved in targeting and/or activating Gadd45 during DNA demethylation.

In order to ensure the sustainability of this sector it is critical to domesticate and selectively improve the major commercial fish species. To date, the genetic markers used in selective breeding of fish account only for a fraction of the observed phenotypic variation. EPIFISH is a scientifically innovative and timely project that will address fish domestication and selection from a new perspective using a multidisciplinary approach. The rapid pace of substantial phenotypic changes during adaptation to new environmental conditions in fish undergoing domestication raises the original hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms are involved in this process. Thus, the overarching aim of EPIFISH is to ascertain the importance of epigenetics in fish domestication using the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) as model species. Specific objectives are i) to determine how selection affects the miRNA transcriptome and the epigenetic landscape during domestication, ii) to perform a functional characterization of miRNA variants and epigenetic alleles associated with growth, and iii) to validate them as potential epigenetic markers for future selective breeding programmes. The identification of epigenetic markers will be a ground-breaking element of EPIFISH with major impact on aquaculture biotechnology, since they will enable the development and application of epigenomic selection as a new feature in future selective breeding programmes. Moreover, the project outcomes will provide novel mechanistic insights into the role of epigenetics in fish domestication, which will surely open new horizons for future frontier research in epigenetics, namely transgenerational inheritance and nutritional epigenetics.

Epigenetics, the study of heritable changes in gene function occurring without a change in the DNA sequence, is a major new field in life sciences. Drosophila has led the way with work starting almost a century ago with position-effect variegation (PEV), a phenomenon of mosaic expression of genes relocated near heterochromatin by a chromosomal rearrangement. Genetic modifiers of PEV have identified essential components of heterochromatin-induced epigenetic silencing as predicted by Reuter and Spierer (1992). We have molecularly identified a number of modifiers of PEV and devoted a lot of work to one of them SU(VAR)3-7. We have revealed that SU(VAR)3-7 participates with other partners in the building of heterochromatin resulting in gene silencing. We have characterized its function by analysing the phenotypes of Su(var)3-7 mutation and over-expression in soma, dissected the different domains of the protein and described its implication in heterochromatin formation as well as it requirement for proper dosage compensation. We plan to pursue our study of SU(VAR)3-7 function with different partners in different pathways. We will also examine the function of the protein in the gonads, find its genomic targets and its interactors particularly in germ cells. In parallel, we will study methyltransferases responsible of H3K9 methylation, as we have produced essential tools, notably null mutations of dG9a and DmSetDB1 by homologous recombination.Aim 1: Exploring transposable elements as targets of SU(VAR)3-7 in heterochromatin. We have found that SU(VAR)3-7 controls the activity of a number of transposable elements (TEs). We plan to describe the effects of Su(var)3-7 mutations on TEs silencing, and the subsequent effects on their transposition. We plan to unravel the mechanisms of action by examining the expected physical association of the protein on TEs and its possible role controlling this part of the genome potentially detrimental. Finally, we showed genetic interaction between Su(var)3-7 and the small interfering RNAs pathways. It is of importance to study the link between the function of SU(VAR)3-7 and the role of small RNAS in genomic silencing, and the implication of other Su(var) genes in TEs silencing. Aim 2: Exploring the role of SU(VAR)3-7 and its heterochromatic partners in gonads. After a comprehensive analysis of SU(VAR)3-7 physiology in the soma, we plan to describe in details the phenotypes of Su(var)3-7 mutations in gonads, among them an unsumoylable SU(VAR)3-7, notably on chromosome integrity and inheritance, oocyte differentiation, genomic silencing, and regulation of TEs activity. We will expand our study to other factors of the chromatin as the H3K9 HMTase dG9a and DmSETDB1 and other Su(var) genes. Aim 3: Analyzing the function of DmSETDB1. We will describe in details the function of DmSETDB1 in the female gonad and test the effect of its targeting to specific promoters. In parallel, we will study the post-translational ubiquitination of DmSETDB1 and characterize its partners. DmSETD1 appears as an important chromatin regulator, and the work in progress should unravel a comprehensive picture of the mechanisms and targets of silencing.Expected Value. We will demonstrate the importance of several actors of gene silencing in epigenetic control of gene expression, in the regulation of TEs, and in chromosome integrity and segregation at mitosis and meiosis. We want to foster this analysis with a special emphasis on the female gonad. In addition to contributing to the expanding field of epigenetics in biology and human diseases, we expect that our work will bring novel understanding on the so far poorly explored role of epigenetic mechanisms in germline differentiation.

Samples will be processed immediately for epithelial cell purification using magnetic bead sorting and generation of intestinal organoids according to established protocols. DNA and RNA will be extracted simultaneously. NLRC5 promoter DNA methylation analyses will be performed using bisulfite pyrosequencing and expression of NLRC5 as well as MHC-I related genes tested using RT-PCR and western blotting. Exposure of organoids to IFN-gamma will determine the impact of DNA methylation on the inducibility of MHC-I signaling. Locus specific, targeted de-methylation will be performed using a CRISPR/Cas9 based method and correlation between DNA methylation and clinical phenotype investigated using various computational approaches. Objective 2: We will generate NLRC5 knock-out and over-expressing human gut organoids using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and piggyBac transposon-based vector system respectively. Organoids from healthy individuals obtained from 2 gut segments will be modified and co-cultured with IFN-gamma. Following, we will perform genome wide expression (RNAseq) and proteomic Tandem Mass Tag profiling on organoids. Generated data will be analysed using novel computational methods such as diffusion-based approaches, which will allow identification of NLRC5 and/or IFN-gamma dependant signalling pathways operative in the human intestinal epithelium. Objective 3: In order to assess the functional impact of NLRC5 expression and MHC-I signaling on the intestinal epithelium in health and CD we will test intestinal epithelial barrier by measuring Transepithelial Electrical Resistance and efflux of FITC-dextran across organoids grown as monolayers. Additionally, we will test innate host response to viral infections and co-culture blood derived CD8+ T-cells with gut organoids and study their interaction using two-photon microscopy.

In particular, work will be directed towards understanding how exposures during mammalian gestation result in lifelong changes to regions of the epigenome. These exposures can be separated into two groups, environmental exposures, and pharmacological interventions. Murine pregnancies will be subjected to chronic toxic insults and analysis will be performed on the exposed offspring. A series of mouse reporter lines will be utilised that enable the longitudinal in vivo tracking of epigenetic change. This is achieved through the knocking in of a bioluminescent reporter into the 3’ UTR of a series of imprinted genes, whose expression is regulated in a well-defined epigenetic, parent-of-origin specific manner. A series of studies have demonstrated that these genes can be sensitive to gestational environmental exposures, resulting in mis-expression of the reporter in exposed offspring. These methods will be employed in addition to more traditional genomics techniques to identify regions of the genome that are exquisitely sensitive to toxic insult. Particular focus will be played to the persistence of any changes that occur as the exposed offspring age, and whether these changes are transmitted to subsequent generations. Mechanistic information will be garnered through comparison of diverse toxic insults and their impact on sensitive regions of the genome. These studies will provide novel information on the extent and lasting impact of toxic exposures during pregnancy. With the mechanistic information. In the longer term this research will help in the development of clear and well-informed Pregnancy Prevention Plans for tested drugs, particularly for those where there are no or only limited alternatives which remains a priority.

In previous studies from the Hanahan lab, a LOH on chromosome 16 (LOH16) was shown to be linked to various steps of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (PNET) progression, particularly after the angiogenic switch [1, 2], suggesting that a gene with tumour-suppressor ability is situated on this locus. Further research at the Hanahan lab suggested two potential candidates with tumour-suppressor activity: the three prime region of the Glycogen synthase kinase 3ß (GSK3ß-3’UTR) and the Calcium Sensing Receptor (CaSR).Biological significance: GSK3ß is a serine-threonine kinase implicated in several cellular processes such as cell fate determination, metabolism, transcriptional and translation control, and pathological conditions such as neurological diseases, and oncogenesis [3]. However, as its functionality in the context of LOH16 was assessed, it was discovered that, contrary to expectations, the KO allele of GSK3ß was not preserved in heterozygous mouse models, but was lost at a similar frequency as the wild type allele, suggesting that GSK3ß itself was not the driving force of tumorigenesis behind LOH16. Following these results, it was hypothesised that GSK3ß’s 3’UTR (i.e. a non-coding mRNA region that directly follows the translation stop codon) could be implicated in PNET tumorigenesis by mechanism still unknown. As 3’UTR regions of mRNA’s importance in homeostasis has long been ignored, little is yet known about their mechanisms of action. However, recent research showed a vast array of actions of 3’UTRs, such as expressing silencer regions that can bind to repressor proteins, expressing microRNA response elements (MREs) that can bind microRNAs (miRs), thus altering the translation of other mRNAs through a competitive endogenous mechanism (ceRNA), but also affecting post-transcriptional gene expression by modulating polyadenylation, stability and efficiency of target mRNAs [4,5].CaSR is mostly known for its effect on extracellular calcium homeostasis, acting principally in the parathyroid glands. However, recent studies showed that CaSR was expressed in many tissues that do not play a clear role in calcium homeostasis, like breast, liver, pancreas and blood vessels, regulating diverse processes, such as hormone secretion, programmed cell death and cellular proliferation [6, 7, 8]. While no bona fide mutations of CaSR have been associated with malignant processes, altered CaSR function and expression have been linked to the progression of breast and colorectal cancer, such as differentiation mechanisms or resistance to therapy [7]. In PNET, preliminary data at the Hanahan lab showed a progressive downregulation of CaSR during the cancer’s progression, which could be, at least partially, attributed to LOH16. In addition, a parallel upregulation of miR15b upregulation was observed; as CaSR possesses a MRE for miR15b, it is hypothesised that they may be an underlying mechanism uniting these two events.Aims: In this study, I will therefore seek to understand the roles of GSK3ß-3’UTR and CaSR in PNET development and their mechanisms of action during the tumour’s progression. I will assess if one or both of the candidates act as tumour suppressors and evaluate the change they impose to the transcriptome. In order to achieve these aims, I will assess the genetic function of each gene by knockout and overexpressing studies. I will also assess the epigenetics events linked to their up/downregulation, such as microRNA (miR) signatures and potential ceRNA mechanisms of mRNA. I will further examine whether pharmacological modulation of CaSR activity, by either agonists or antagonists, has any translational and clinical value for PNET treatment. Finally, I will seek to understand if these mechanisms are limited to PNET development or if they have a broader influence in other cancer development.Conclusion: This study firstly proposes to study two potential tumour suppressors in PNET and to deepen our understanding of previously unknown regulation factors, such as the 3’UTR region of mRNA. If successful, it will lead to a general better understanding of the mechanisms of cancer and could strongly contribute to the development of novel therapies.MD-PhD project summary - A. P.

Currently, 300 million people (4.2%) suffer from asthma, 500 million (6.5%) from atopic dermatitis (AD), 900 million (12 %) from allergic rhinitis) and 700 million (9%) from food allergy worldwide. The prevalence of these four allergic diseases is approximately 1.7 million 22% in Switzerland. Atopic dermatitis is the most prevalent chronic disease in childhood. Asthma represents one of the highest costs to health care system. Allergic rhinitis is the number one disease for job absenteeism (missing work days) and presenteeism (being on the job, but not fully functioning because of disease). Approximately, 5-10% of all of these diseases present with severe forms and can cause deaths. It was recently shown by us and others that epithelial tight junction barrier defect plays an important role in the pathogenesis of these diseases.Epithelial barrier function: of asthmatic bronchial epithelial cells, sinus epithelial cells in chronic rhinosinusitis and skin keratinocytes in atopic dermatitis have been demonstrated to be defective and leaky. Allergens, bacterial toxins and other particles are able to penetrate the leaky epithelium, where they may activate the immune system cells leading to severe chronic inflammation. Epithelial tight junctions (TJ) are responsible for the regulation of paracellular flux and epithelial impermeability and can be considered as gatekeepers that could contribute both to aggravation of inflammation-related tissue damage or resolution of inflammation via drainage towards out side of the affected tissues. This study focuses on the regulation of particularly TJ barrier by epigenetic mechanisms and inflammasome.Planned experiments: According to our strong preliminary data, we hypothesize here that “epithelial tight junction barrier is epigenetically controlled” and “epithelial barrier leakiness is affected by inflammasome and both TJ barrier and inflammasome are epigenetically regulated”. We will perform this research in asthma and atopic dermatitis in parallel and particularly focus on in vivo relevant findings that will be obtained from direct human primary cells and biopsies as well as mouse models. We aim to demonstrate epigenetic mechanisms of bronchial and skin epithelial barrier leakiness in different endotypes and phenotypes of asthma and atopic dermatitis and bring a new perspective from bench to patient side. We will use several important and in vivo relevant stimulants to study the “barrier”, “epigenetics” and “inflammasome” triangle. They will be house dust mite, human rhinovirus, commercial detergents and their surfactants, and CpG oligonucleotides. In this way, we will be able to investigate barrier damaging and recovering as well as inflammasome-activating and -nonactivating stimulants.Impact and innovative potential: The ultimate aim of this research is to find out novel preventive and treatment ways for two major allergic diseases, asthma and atopic dermatitis to decrease the individual burden of the patients and their families, which affects almost half of the World’s population and extremely high health care costs. Our research includes disease endo and phenotyping concepts and opens a new window for a precision medicine approach to barrier leakiness, such as the establishment of leaky barrier endotype. Many aspects of this research will find broader impact in other disciplines of human and veterinary medicine, because similar mechanisms of epithelial barrier dysregulation play roles in other diseases such as chronic rhinosinusitis, COPD and inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, epigenetic regulation of inflammasome activation thresholds has a link to essentially all inflammatory diseases.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div.

Both experimental and clinical evidence suggest that autoreactive B and T cells are key players in the pathogenesis. The recent success of B cell-depleting therapies in MS has highlighted the essential role of B cells. Despite these tremendous advances in our understanding of the disease and the increasing number of treatment options for our patients, the disease triggers still remain elusive. The fact that genetic predisposition can only explain a fraction of the risk to develop MS suggests the presence of other factors such as epigenetics and environmental variables. Recent data suggest that the composition of gut microbiota in MS patients is different (dysbiosis) from healthy controls and that this dysbiosis contributes to inflammation in MS. The precise role of B cells in shaping the microbiota and whether B cells are modulated as a consequence of dysbiosis remains poorly understood.Here I propose to decipher the crosstalk between B cells and gut microbiota in MS patients and healthy controls. My central hypothesis is that MS microbiota exert a pro-inflammatory phenotype on B cells that is normally balanced by IgA that targets pro-inflammatory microbes. In Aim 1, I will identify bacteria that are targeted by IgA in gut, blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and study how these bacteria affect B cell behavior in vitro. In Aim 2, I will utilize a unique model of MS dysbiosis by transplanting human stool into germ-free mice. With this novel animal model, I will analyze immunogenicity of IgA-bound bacteria, and test an IgA immunotherapy targeting pro-inflammatory bacteria. Finally, in Aim 3, I will search for evidence of bacterial translocation into the blood as a result of dysbiosis and elevated gut permeability in MS.Overall, this project will provide insights into the fundamental processes underlying the adaption of B cells to the microbiota and immunoselection of microbiota by B cells in homeostasis and dysbiosis in MS and will potentially lead to novel therapeutic strategies modulating the gut microbiota.

These 4 groups have complementary expertise in stem cell biology and neuronal differentiation, in the epigenetics of developmental restriction and in the development of the mouse nervous system. They have defined the following common objectives. First, they propose to characterize the pluripotent status of human embryonic stem cells. This is a prerequisite for the establishment of a tissue culture system allowing reproducible neuronal differentiation. Second, the extent of reprogramming of human somatic cells will be explored and compared with what has been achieved and defined with human embryonic stem cells. Third, they will perform molecular analyses of the pathways followed by embryonic and reprogrammed cells leading to the neural lineage. Fourth, neural stem cells will be studied in the mouse with regard to their ability to contribute to neurogenesis and the epigenetics of their developmental program analysed. Neurogenesis will be analysed in vivo in the mouse and in vitro with human neural progenitors as a minimal system reflecting aspects of human brain development.The cornerstone of the strategy is the exploitation of recent knowledge gathered by the 4 participating groups with mouse stem cells, both in culture and in vivo during the development of the nervous system. Indeed, the mouse currently represents the only mammalian organism allowing the validation of results obtained with cultured cells, including embryonic and reprogrammed stem cells, as well as neural progenitors derived from stem cells. Our objectives could not be reached by groups working in isolation as detailed knowledge and expertise in several different areas are needed for the common objectives to be reached. The availability of techniques allowing the reprogramming of human somatic cells has, in principle, opened new ways of studying the function and dysfunction of human neurons in vitro. As human neurons can be generated in unlimited numbers, such tissue culture systems also drugs to be screen for their ability to correct functional defects. While these objectives are ambitious, they are more realistic than claims of repair of the nervous system. The research proposed in this joint effort would greatly benefit the training of young scientists in Switzerland and the stem cell and medical community at large would benefit from the pursuit of achievable goals.

Evidence suggests that leukemic cells originate during fetal life; however, prevention strategies are lacking because the causes of childhood ALL are not yet well understood. Currently lacking in this field is an understanding of the role of DNA methylation (epigenetics). Indeed, aberrant DNA methylation patterns are found in leukemic cells during ALL oncogenesis. These patterns are likely created during progenitor cell development, and are known to modify gene expression and cell and tissue phenotype, without modification in DNA sequence. Folate (or vitamin B9) is a necessary cofactor for DNA methylation, which-along with vitamins B2, B6 and B12-is involved in the “one-carbon” metabolic cycle, and may be a limiting factor in DNA methylation. The Childhood Leukemia International Consortium study has shown that folate intake supplementation during pregnancy was associated with a lower risk of childhood ALL. Moreover, my preliminary results support the hypothesis that the availability of folate during pregnancy could be critical, due to its potential limiting effect on DNA methylation. Several studies have indeed hypothesized that folate depletion during pregnancy and altered folate metabolism might lead to aberrant DNA methylation, which could lead subsequently to ALL development.Hypothesis Based on preliminary findings and on previous studies, I postulate that low folate intake during fetal development might modify the neonate’s DNA genome-wide methylation pattern, and that such a modified pattern can lead to ALL development during childhood.Methods I will incorporate for the first time key measurements of biomarkers of one-carbon metabolism (blood homocysteine concentration and folate in erythrocytes) in 1,400 ALL children and healthy controls at birth, as well as in a subset of 400 mothers of those children at the second trimester of their pregnancy. Genetic material (DNA) will be obtained from dried-blood spot (DBS), and will be subjected to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450K Array method of DNA methylation analysis. The dataset will be split into two equal parts, one for the discovery, and the other for the validation of the results.Analyses I will investigate the potential association between the genome-wide DNA methylation pattern at birth and any differences in one-carbon metabolism with the risk of developing ALL in childhood. In addition, I will test for a synergic effect of the maternal and child’s folate status on child’s DNA methylation profile and risk of ALL. Discussion This prospective approach would be the first to examine folate and homocysteine levels in pregnancy in relation to leukemogenesis, and therefore provides crucial data in the effort leading to childhood ALL prevention. If I confirm the hypothesis, maternal folate and other important one-carbon micronutrient intake (ie., vitamin B6 and B12) during pregnancy could be a relatively easily modifiable factor.

Three types of epigenetic alterations are currently believed to be causally implicated in providing cancer cells with the ability to drive tumor growth and progression, namely DNA methylation, chromatin remodelling as a result of covalent histone modifications and non-coding RNAs, particularly microRNAs (miRNA). Precise understanding of such mechanisms may help identify a set of targets for the development of new therapeutic strategies.The cancer stem cell (CSC) model was revived in recent years with the notion that a tumor initiating cell acquires increased self-renewal capacity through genetic mutations and epigenetic modification, maintaining the tumor drive indefinitely. CSC express various embryonic stem cell genes, including CD133, often used a stem cell marker. CSC are capable to reproduce the original tumor in vivo upon injection in immunocompromised mice, thereby giving birth to heterogenous cell subpopulations, composed of CSC as well as more differentiated progeny. As they are more prone to chemotherapy resistance, it can be conceived that targeting and eradicating CSC may lead to cure of cancers in which CSC provide the driving force for growth and progression.In the case of Ewing’s sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT), a group of rare but highly aggressive tumors arising in mesenchymal tissue in children and young adults, conventional chemotherapies are not sufficient to effectively treat patients and prevent relapse, primarily due to early metastasis. 85% of ESFT present a single mutation, the translocation t(11;22), leading to the formation of an aberrant fusion protein EWS-FLI1.The epigenetic state of primary cells is believed to determine whether they may or may not be permissive for oncogene-induced transformation. Thus, in depth understanding of epigenetically regulated cell permissiveness for oncogene expression and the mechanisms that regulate epigenetic changes upon transformation are key steps toward developing rational mechanism-based targeted anti-cancer therapies.The aim of my project will be to further investigate the role of epigenetics in regard to EWS-FLI1 by identifying and characterizing CSC and exploring how epigenetic alterations lead to their emergence and direct their tumor initiating and metastasis promoting properties.1- Determination and analysis of ESFT cells signature epigenetic profile.First, I will describe the epigenetic profile of spherogenic and adherent ESFT cells. I will address the epigenetic markers changes between the more tumorigenic sphere-forming cells and the adherent cells by focusing on histone methylation and acetylation.2- Determination of chromatin modification in CD133+ versus CD133- cells.Secondly, I will determine chromatin modifications in CD133+ versus CD133- cells. These cells will be isolated from fresh human tumor samples or from ESFT propagated in immunocompromised mice. I will also assess the influence of human versus murine microenvironment on CD133+ epigenetic markers.3- Assessment of epigenetic changes that underlie cell permissiveness for EWS-FLI1 expression and function.Finally, as EZH2 has been shown to facilitate EWS-FLI1 expression in fibroblasts, I will perform RNA-seq gene expression comparison between cells transduced with EZH2 and their control counterparts. I will then perform ChIP-seq on both sets of fibroblasts to identify EZH2-induced chromatin mark changes and correlate them with gene expression data. Selected genes could be tested for responsibility in blocking or enhancing permissiveness for EWS-FLI1 expression.The major contribution of this work will be to assess epigenetic differences between fresh primary tumor initiating and non-tumorigenic bulk tumor cells in ESFT. Such a study has never been done in part because of the paucity of primary tumor samples and in part because of the challenge of nano-ChIP-seq technology. My host lab provides me with the possibility to overcome both obstacles as it possesses and continues to obtain primary ESFT samples and has established nano-ChIP-seq technology. In addition, the project will assess the effect of in vitro culture and mouse propagation on CSC and non-CSC ESFT populations, which is a central issue toward understanding how well cultured tumor cells and tumor cells grown in mice represent the corresponding fresh primary cells. Finally, the project will define the epigenetic events that convert a non-permissive to a permissive cellular environment for EWS-FLI-1 expression and function, which will provide important and long sought insight into the pathogenesis of ESFT.

Genetic factors contribute to the risk of DKD. If we could identify these genetic factors, we could better understand the mechanisms by which DKD occurs, and thereby accelerate the development of better therapies. We established the GENIE consortium, a collaboration between Queen's University Belfast, University of Dublin, University of Helsinki, and the Broad Institute. Together, we completed the largest genetic study to date of DKD, and successfully identified the first two robust genetic risk factors for DKD. In a separately funded genetic study, we are collaborating with additional groups to extend our efforts and encompass larger samples. To better understand the underlying biology and pathophysiology of DKD, we propose to complement and build on our past and ongoing genetic studies in several critical ways. We will leverage a co-funding mechanism between Ireland, Northern Ireland and the US to carry out a multidisciplinary investigation of DKD. We will assemble and jointly analyze all available genetic data pertinent to DKD, to begin the process of discovering rarer variants with stronger effects on DKD. We will also generate DNA methylation data in kidney and blood, and in patients with and without DKD, and also expression data in samples relevant to DKD. We use a novel and powerful method to integrate the genetic, epigenetic and genomic data to generate hypotheses about the biological causes of DKD, and test these hypotheses with further genetic studies (sequencing in a large follow-up sample) and with functional studies in models of DKD. This international, multidisciplinary collaboration will build on genetic discoveries to help decipher the underlying biology and pathophysiology of DKD and thereby guide the prevention and treatment of this important disease.

Our system model is the Natural Killer (NK) cell. Specifically, we will investigate the mechanisms by which these players of innate immunity achieve tolerance to self and participate to immune responses. Multidisciplinary approaches will be combined to achieve groundbreaking results at nanoscopic and macroscopic scales on the following issues:- How NK cells are educated to self-tolerance?- How NK cells distinguish their targets from normal cells?- How NK cells participate to immunological memory?THINK (THe Immune function of Natural Killer cells) is a challenging project supported by an array of preliminary data obtained by our team of investigators in various fields of expertise:- innate immunity and NK cells in human and mouse models- random insertional mutagenesis in the mouse- genome-wide epigenetic, transcriptomic and RNAi analysis and - state-of-the-art optical imaging techniques from intravital biphoton microscopy to the quantification of proteins in nano-sized areas of the cell. THINK is thus a multidisciplinary project that bridges disciplines: immunology, biophysics, genetics and epigenetics. In a scientific perspective, we think that this project will open new technological and scholar horizons, in reassessing the actual concepts on the links between innate immunity, tissue homeostasis and stress response. In a clinical and translational perspective, we also think that this project will help to design innovative NK cell-based therapies and immunomonitoring protocols.

This PhD project aims to investigate epigenetics research in the making, in order to understand how, where and why the new epigenetic knowledge is produced and identify the elements influencing the production of this emerging body of knowledge. More particularly, I will analyse the epigenetic notion of environment, by unpacking what it means in specific cases. Specifically, the project will entail: 1. A literature analysis: I will carry out both a systematic review of published epigenetics re search to examine how the notion of environment is understood and defined in the literature and a systematic review of the social science literature to understand to what extent the notion of environment is critically reflected on. 2. Fieldwork: I will explore how the notion of environment is conceptualised and enacted in two case studies using ethnographic methods: breast cancer epigenetics and the EpiTwin project looking at diabetes. 3. Analysis: I will carry out a narrative analysis of th e data collected during fieldwork in order to explore how researchers in epigenetics make sense of their world and understand the notion of environment in their professional lives.

This genetic information programs how and when genes will be expressed within the diverse number of cells of an organism. Epigenetic mechanisms such as chromatin and DNA modifications give rise to heritable gene expression changes without affecting the DNA code. Research in epigenetics led to the discoveries of novel gene regulatory mechanisms with heritable features. A similar paradigm has now emerged with RNA. RNA carries the message encoded in the DNA. Yet this message itself can also be altered by chemical modifications. There are currently more than 150 diverse modifications found on RNA and a greater number of proteins are required for their biogenesis and recognition. Recent discoveries have shown that RNA modifications can be dynamically regulated and they have been implicated in embryonic development, longevity, neurological diseases and cancers in humans and in animal models. The heritable nature of epigenetic mechanisms requires gene expression changes within the germ cells, which give rise to the offspring. Germline development, germ cell proliferation and identity are essential for the survival of organisms. Epigenetic mechanisms play key roles in genome defence by targeting foreign elements and they also prevent somatic gene expression in the germ cells. Still, in some animals, it is possible to reprogram the epigenetic pathways to establish heritable gene expression changes that can last many generations. The biological role of most RNA modifications remains unclear in multicellular organisms and their role in heritable gene expression regulation is not explored. Research using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as an animal model made pioneering contributions to the discovery and understanding of epigenetic gene regulatory pathways in animal germlines. Up until recently, the RNA modification landscape of C. elegans was not know. In order to establish C. elegans as a model system to study the role of RNA modifications, I developed mass spectrometry methods that enable the identification and quantification of modified RNAs. Using these methods, I showed that several RNA modifications found in C. elegans show changes upon stress such as dietary restriction or high temperatures. In some instances, these changes in RNA modifications can be reversed. My research aims to uncover the role of a specific group of RNA modifications that contain a methyl group. By understanding how RNA methylations contribute to gene expression changes in germ cells, I aim to discover their epigenetic functions. Using a combination of biochemical and genetic methods, I will (i) develop an enzyme specific sequencing method for methylated RNAs (ii) study the role of RNA methylations in animal germ cells (iii) investigate how RNA methylome itself is regulated by dietary metabolism This research is important because, first the proposed sequencing method will benefit a large research community and enable the profiling of RNA methylations in multicellular organisms. Second, understanding the role of RNA modifications in germ cells will reveal their role in cell proliferation and differentiation that will benefit research in human diseases such as cancer and fertility. And finally, my research has the potential to pioneer a new research direction on how our diet can affect gene expression through RNA modifications.	Medical Research Council	Fellowship	1224902.0	GBP
210	Dr Jean-Michel Fustin	The University of Manchester	School of Medical Sciences	2020-03-02	2024-03-01	Methylation of mRNA as a coupling mechanism between diet, metabolism and the circadian clock.	DNA encodes our genetic information, which is ultimately turned into proteins - the building blocks and functional molecules of our cells. However, DNA must first be "transcribed" into a transient intermediary molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA), which are short copies of individual genes, providing instructions for the production of specific proteins. This additional step allows for fluidity in the expression of certain genes based on the needs of a cell, as hundreds of mRNA copies can be read to produce proteins simultaneously (rather than a single copy in the DNA), and then degraded when no longer needed. Thus, the relative rates of mRNA production and degradation are controlled to govern the responses of our cells. This control can be achieved through the addition of a small chemical group called "methyl", composed of one carbon atom linked to three hydrogen atoms, at various locations along the mRNA molecule. Despite being fundamental to life, we actually understand very little of the significance of mRNA methylation in adult animals, as deficiencies are lethal during development and embryos do not survive. Our research will seek to understand the functional role of various types of mRNA methylation using genetically-modified mice that can grow normally and healthily into adulthood, and then be "transformed" into mice deficient in mRNA methylation. This will give us the opportunity to study the behaviour and metabolism of animals deficient in mRNA methylations for the first time. One of the main questions to be investigated is whether mRNA methylation underlies our biological clock, a process central to our responses to food, disease and infection. The biological clock that ticks inside virtually every cell in our body relies on a constant flow of mRNA, with genes interlocked in negative transcription-translation feedback loops, meaning their proteins regulate the production of their own mRNAs. We already have data to show that one type of mRNA methylation affects particular components of the biological clock in cell culture, but we do not know what are the consequences of the lack of methylation on the behaviour of the animals related to the biological clock, such as eating and activity rhythms, and synchronization of their rhythms to the light-dark cycle. Another fundamental knowledge gap exists between mRNA methylation and our metabolic state. Methylation is not just restricted to mRNA, but also affects our DNA, and many proteins, thus representing one of the most common forms of chemical modifications occurring within the cell. Usually, methylation is a reversible and dynamic process, but whether mRNA methylation can be dynamically regulated, maybe providing a way by which the cell can rapidly adjust its biology, is still a matter of debate. Interestingly, methylation depends on nutrients such as the essential amino acid methionine and the vitamins B9 and B12. How, if at all, is mRNA methylation regulated by our diet and metabolism? Can the normal rest/activity cycles that are controlled by our circadian clock, impact on mRNA methylation? Is it affected by deficiency in methionine or vitamins B9/B12, contributing to the pathologies that arises from these deficiencies, such as anaemia? The expanding field of epigenetics is already demonstrating that methylation of our DNA can influenced by environmental exposures such as diet and smoking, and the aging process, and the subsequent changes in gene expression have measurable effects on the appearance and progression of disease. It stands to reason that mRNA methylation may be similarly influenced by our lifestyle and environment, and provide opportunities for intervention in certain diseases or metabolic disorders. Only by understanding more about the underlying biology of mRNA methylation will we be able to unlock this potential.	Medical Research Council	Fellowship	974920.0	GBP

Interactions between diet, gut microbiota, altered mucosal and systemic immunity and host metabolism have been strongly implicated, but have not been systematically studied. In addition, approximately 10 to15% of patients with NAFLD will progress to develop non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and around 5% will develop cirrhosis. The factors determining individual susceptibility to develop NASH are also incompletely understood but genetic factors account for about one-third of the variance. NAFLD is a significant emergent cause of liver disease in India. These population show distinct differences in body composition compared to their Caucasian counterparts, in particular, they have a significantly higher percentage body fat for given body weight. In this proposal, we adopt a systems medicine approach to interrogate the factors associated with NAFLD development and progression in India, and to explore its pathophysiology. Currently available information on basic demography, life style factors, physical findings, and laboratory test results in 1200 NAFLD cases and 4,200 controls will be combined with new information on liver stiffness (Fibroscan), as a measure of disease progression, and the results of genome-wide and epigenome-wide association studies in order to identify risk factors for NAFLD and its progression. Insights into disease pathogenesis will be provided by undertaking faecal metagenomics and targeted bacterial metabolite profiling in urine/plasma/stool, immune cell characterisation with an emphasis on innate and mucosal immunity and functional studies to determine the effects of bacterial metabolites on immune cell phenotype.

Indeed progress in understanding tumorigenesis mechanisms has proved its therapeutics potential, yet most of them remained elusive or unknown. The research plan presented here is in line with this ongoing effort, proposing to explore promising new mechanisms in tumorigenesis using cutting edge technologies. Cancer cells are characterized by the presence of genetic and epigenetic alterations that lead to loss of cell identity, uncontrolled cell proliferation, cell invasion and metastasis. However, upstream events that drive the appearance and selection of these alterations remain poorly understood. Past two decades has revealed the key function of epigenetics mechanisms in maintaining cell identity and genome stability whereas their corruption is a hallmark of tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Epigenetic information relies on a combination of DNA modifications, nucleosomes positioning and modification, and many proteins that define, maintain and functionally translate this information. Therefore to maintain cell identity, faithfully duplication and transmission of epigenetic information to daughter cells is as important as duplication and transmission of the genetic information. However, little is known about how the epigenetic information is propagated during the cell cycle and recent findings raise the question of its potential implication in tumorigenesis. In S phase, the progression of DNA replication forks provokes a genome-wide disruption of the epigenetic information. This proposal aims to reveal how cells restore epigenetic information after DNA replication and to explore the interplay between these mechanisms and tumorigenesis. To this end, I will combine Nascent Chromatin Capture (NCC), a technology for purification of newly synthetized chromatin that I have developed, with mass spectrometry, high-throughput microscopy and screening technologies in normal and cancer cells. Newly identified players that are subjected to deregulation in cancer will be next characterized in order to understand their role in cancer development and their therapeutic potential.

Age related conditions in adults often find their origin in risk factors operative in early life. The molecular mechanisms behind these phenomena remain largely unknown. Mitochondria are involved in a variety of critical cell functions, including oxidative energy production and programmed cell death. Recently, I established in a study of 175 newborns, a strong association between mitochondrial DNA content and in utero exposure to particulate air pollution. Telomere length is highly heritable and erosion leads to an increasingly vulnerable structural integrity of the chromosomes. It is considered a marker of overall biological age compared with chronological age. In this regard, I demonstrated the heritability of telomere length and the influence of smoking on telomere erosion. These results support the ENVIRONAGE hypothesis, i.e. that environmental inputs influence biomolecular markers of ageing including mitochondrial function, telomere length along with DNA repair and epigenetics as the ‘core axis of ageing’. The aim is to establish prospective epidemiological evidence for molecular mechanisms or early biomarkers, which may underlie the origins or reflect the risk of age-related diseases and to understand its association with other processes and the influence of environmental factors. To this end, I will establish a birth cohort and a cohort in middle-aged and elderly. I measure environmental pollutants, in interaction with parameters that I consider to have an important role in the ageing process (mitochondrial function, telomere length, epigenetics and DNA repair capacity). ENVIRONAGE integrates environmental influences and molecular mechanisms on ageing. The common molecular epidemiological strategies in newborns, middle-aged and elderly to unravel the environmental influence on ageing are groundbreaking.

214	Dr Laura EME	CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS	None	2019-03-01	2024-02-29	The macroevolutionary impact of epigenetics and lateral gene transfer on eukaryotic genomes	Multicellular organisms (e.g., animals, fungi and plants) are the best-studied eukaryotes but their ancestors and the vast majority of eukaryotic diversity correspond to microbial species (“protists”). The evolutionary history of protists is closely connected to the evolution of the eukaryotic cell itself. However, most protist diversity is still genomically unexplored, limiting our investigation of eukaryotic evolution. For example, while the importance of lateral gene transfer (LGT) in prokaryotic evolution is well recognized, its role in eukaryotic evolution is still debated. In addition, although epigenetic mechanisms represent a hallmark of eukaryotic genome regulation, we know surprisingly little about the evolution of these mechanisms across eukaryotic diversity. The overarching goal of my project is to understand how epigenetic mechanisms and LGT have shaped the macroevolution of eukaryotic genomes. This project has several inter-related intermediate objectives, which each in themselves will bring crucial insights into eukaryotic evolution: 1) reconstructing a robust phylogeny of eukaryotes; 2) inferring the gene content of the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor; 3) tracing the evolution of genes involved in epigenetic mechanisms and obtaining epigenomic maps from under-studied protists; 4) investigating the intriguing hypothesis of a possible interplay between epigenetic regulation and horizontal gene transfer and its influence on eukaryotic genome evolution: Have genes involved in epigenomic mechanisms been transferred between eukaryotes? Do epigenomic modifications affect the frequency of LGT in different lineages? To achieve this, I will characterize the transcriptomes, genomes, methylomes and small RNAs of understudied eukaryotic microbes selected for their key phylogenetic position, and to analyse them using state-of-the-art bioinformatic methods. I will target uncultivated protists, using single-cell techniques and novel genome-scaffolding approaches.	European Research Council	Starting Grant	1499945.0	EUR

Although epigenetic changes, and in particular of DNA methylation (DNAm), have been linked with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, with findings opening novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets, they have not been studied in DLB. This pilot study aims to explore the role of neuronal DNAm changes in DLB by combining laser-capture microdissection (LCM), for isolation of specific neurons affected by pathology, with genome-wide DNAm analysis using reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS). Our hypothesis is that DLB pathogenesis is associated with distinct epigenetic changes that can help to identify therapeutic targets. We also hypothesise that neurons bearing Lewy body pathology have a specific epigenetic signature compared to unaffected ones. To address our hypotheses this pilot project aims to: 1. Optimize and test the methodology for LCM of specific neurons from post-mortem brain suitable for DNAm analysis. 2. Combine LCM with RRBS for neuronal methylomic profiling of DLB cases and matched controls 3. Compare methylomic profiles of affected by Lewy Body pathology neurons with unaffected neurons within each individual 4. Identify methylation quantitative trait loci in DLB by combining methylomic profiling with available genomic data 5. Associate methylation changes with ante-mortem cognitive and neuroimaging data The analyses will focus both on known risk genes that have been previously linked with DLB (e.g SNCA) and on genome-wide analyses for identification of novel targets. Data gathered from this project will be the basis for future larger scale work.	The Academy of Medical Sciences	None	29668.0	GBP
216	Dr. Luca GIORGETTI	Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research	None	2018-01-01	2022-12-31	Biophysical mechanisms of long-range transcriptional regulation	In mammals, transcriptional control of many genes relies on cis-regulatory elements such as enhancers, which are often located tens to hundreds of kilobases away from their cognate promoters. Functional interactions between distal regulatory elements and target promoters require mutual physical proximity, which is linked to the three-dimensional structure of the chromatin fiber. Chromosome conformation capture studies revealed that chromosomes are partitioned into Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), sub-megabase domains of preferential physical interactions of the chromatin fiber. Genetic evidence showed that TAD boundaries restrict the genomic range of enhancer-promoter communication, and that interactions between regulatory sequences within TADs are further fine-tuned by smaller-scale structures. However, the mechanistic details of how physical interactions translate into transcriptional outputs are totally unknown. Here we propose to explore the biophysical mechanisms that link chromosome conformation and long-range transcriptional regulation using molecular biology, genetic engineering, single-cell experiments and physical modeling. We will measure chromosomal interactions in single cells and in time using a novel method that relies on an enzymatic process in vivo. Genetic engineering will be used to establish a cell system that allows quantitative measurement of how enhancer-promoter interactions relate to transcription at the population and single-cell levels, and to test the effects of perturbations without confounding effects. Finally, we will develop physical models of promoter operation in the presence of distal enhancers, which will be used to interpret the experimental data and formulate new testable predictions. With this integrated approach we aim at providing an entirely new layer of description of the general principles underlying transcriptional control, which could establish new paradigms for research in epigenetics and gene regulation.

It proposes new formal models and a systematic agenda to empirically test hypotheses that link developmental biology, epigenetics and adult human illness, disability and mortality. We seek to break new ground developing innovative formal models for illnesses and mortality, testing new hypotheses about the evolution of human health and, to the extent permitted by findings, reformulating standard theories to make them applicable to a less restrictive segment of populations than they are now. Over the past two decades there has been massive growth of research on the nature of delayed adult effects of conditions experienced in early life. This field of research is known as the Developmental Origins of Adult Health and Disease (DOHaD). Increasing evidence suggests that the mechanisms that are implicated are epigenetic and constitute an evolved adaptation selected over thousands of years to improve fitness in changing landscapes. The emergence of DOHaD is as close as we will ever come to a paradigmatic shift in the study of human health, disability and mortality. The most tantalizing possibility is that advances in our understanding of epigenetic mechanisms will shed light on pathways linking early exposures and delayed adult health thus fundamentally transforming our understanding of human illnesses and, in one fell swoop, bridge population health, epigenetics, and developmental and evolutionary biology. The overarching goal of this project is to contribute to this nascent area of study by (a) proposing new formal demographic models of health, disability and mortality; (b) empirically testing DOHaD predictions with population data; (c) testing a microsimulation model to verify DOHaD predictions about two conditions, obesity and Type 2 Diabetes, and (d) assessing the adult health, disability and mortality toll implicated by relations between early conditions, obesity and T2D.

218	Dr Aled Parry	Babraham Institute	None	2019-08-01	2023-07-31	Enhancer DNA methylation dynamics during early mammalian development	Early mammalian development is characterised by profound transcriptional rewiring and epigenetic remodelling, including a global change in DNA methylation (DNAme) levels. Enhancers, regulatory elements that direct spatiotemporal gene expression, are the most variably methylated regions in the genome, but the functional consequences of these alterations are not known. Enhancer DNAme has been associated with both gene repression and gene activation, but the majority of studies are correlative or focus on single loci and a systematic analysis is currently lacking. I aim to use a novel reporter-screen based approach together with cutting-edge (epi)genomics approaches (capture Hi-C, ChIP-seq, RNA-seq) to determine whether DNA methylation affects (1) enhancer activity and (2) enhancer-promoter looping interactions in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). I will determine the functional effects of enhancer methylation using in vitro differentiation assays and by generating chimeric embryos. Genome wide methylation will be perturbed using DNA methyltransferase knockout cells whilst locus-specific manipulation will be achieved using epigenetic editing techniques (dCas9-TET1 fusion proteins). The proposed research will generate valuable datasets for the fields of epigenetics and development and the principles discovered will be applicable to developmental biology and other scenarios where DNAme is substantially altered, including cancer and aging.

In the US, schools and closed, yet there is variability across states and cities regarding pandemic recommendation on social distancing. The situation likely affects different children in different ways, due to varying levels of familial financial impact, self or family COVID-19 illness, mental health effects of social distancing and stress, online activity, scholastic activity, adult supervision, and indirect health influences of altered physical activity, sleep, and access to nutrition. The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development project (ABCD) is a longitudinal study of 11,878 diverse youth enrolled at ages 9-10 in 2016-2018 (birth years 2006-2009) at 21 research sites around the United States. This RAPID project will design and implement a new survey, to assess personal impact of COVID-19 on ABCD participants and families. With this new information, we can leverage existing ABCD data to examine perturbations in developmental trajectories of brain functioning, neurocognition, mental health, substance use, academic achievement, and social functioning. By immediately collecting a unique set of measures that characterize the pandemic?s effects, we can make use of the existing ABCD protocol and design in this large, diverse, national sample. Results from this study will provide substantially improved guidelines for future epidemics and pandemics, and indicate potential targets for interventions when other traumas affect children.<br/><br/>The ABCD cohort is being followed until at least age 20, with: biennial state-of-the-art neuroimaging, epigenetics/genetics, and physical activity tracking; annual cognitive testing and assessments with youth and parents on mental and physical health and development, life events and trauma exposure, culture and environment, substance use, sleep, and screen time; and biannual brief assessments of mental health and substance use. The proposed research would immediately characterize the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on each child via a youth and parent self-assessment that characterizes their personal level of family disruption, social distancing and its impact, attitudes, adherence to public health directives, and media exposure. This crisis provides a unique opportunity to make use of ABCD?s elaborate infrastructure and rigorous scientific processes to discern critical dimensions of behavior not previously envisioned. The impending severity of this unanticipated pandemic may result in significant influences on school-age youth for decades, and this RAPID will be critical to characterizing factors that protect and exacerbate its effects. This research will immediately examine COVID-19 related effects on youth, and how their practices around virus transmission and prevention vary as a function of family and social factors, external influences, and other characteristics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Moreover, preeclampsia increases long-term cardiovascular risk in women, and in their children, in the years after pregnancy. The mechanisms mediating the effects of pre-eclampsia on both early and late adverse cardiovascular outcomes remain unknown. We have developed a new mouse model based on conditional deletion of endothelial Gch1 and discovered that the females develop progessive hypertension and foetal growth restriction during pregnancy. Importantly, the wild-type offspring of these pregnancies also develop hypertension in later life, despite not carrying the endothelial Gch1 deletion. Thus, we will use this mouse to identify the structural and molecular vascular remodelling that lead to hypertension in pregnancy, and to investigate the role of epigenetics in ‘programming’ of vascular remodelling. Furthermore, we will test how the pregnancy phenotype can be rescued by drug treatment, investigating the translational potential to prevent preeclampsia and its long term consequences for both mothers and offspring.

Analysis of the interaction of Eed-Ezh2 with Xist RNA will involve branching into more biochemical approaches. Analysis of dynamic changes in epigenetic modifications (DNA methylation and histone N-terminal modification) during progression of X inactivation will be undertaken, at a pilot study level, by establishing X chromosome genomic contigs on microarrays for probing with immunoprecipitated material. Studies on X chromosome reactivation in developing germ cells and in cell fusion systems will utilise developmental and cell biological approaches, coupled to genetic analysis.

Using ES cells as a powerful tool, we will assess the progression of epigenetic reprogramming at ICRs upon Parp1 deletion and the factors involved. In a series of intercalated experiments, we will elucidate whether Parp1 is an integral component of the ICR chromatin protein complex, or whether it is the conferred post-translational modification of ICR complex members that is critical for imprint maintenance. We will also test whether the few genomic regions that are hypomethylated in Parp1-/- ES cells in addition to known ICRs demarcate yet unknown imprinting control regions that may identify novel imprinted genes. In parallel, the impact of Parp1 deficiency on imprinted gene regulation in vivo will be scrutinized. We will assess existing knockout models (of mild severity level) of Parp1, the highly related Parp2, and double mutants. The analyses will include to determine, in candidate and genome-wide approaches, the effect on DNA methylation, histone modifications (H3K9me3) and imprinted gene expression during gestation and postnatally. This will be complemented by a detailed analysis of developmental progression, postnatal and adult health, including assessment of the putative link to obesity that has been previously noted. Germ line mutants will serve to determine whether Parp1 (& Parp2) play a role in the establishment as well as the maintenance of gametic imprints, in epigenome surveillance and protection from transgenerational inheritance of epimutations. This research is pertinent to our understanding of imprinting disorders and how they might arise for example in infertility treatments. Thereby, it will identify novel avenues for potential therapeutic intervention. It also provides direct links between epigenome (dys)regulation and cancer biology, in which Parp1 is a major player.

224	Professor Simon Mead	MRC Prion Unit	None	1999-04-01	2017-05-31	Genetics, Epigenetics and Bioinformatics	The MRC Prion Unit Human Molecular Genetics of Prion and Related Dementias Programme investigates why some people, but not others, get prion diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). By comparing genetic differences between people who developed CJD and healthy people we hope to identify genes that influence why particular people are more susceptible to these diseases, and use this information to better estimate public health risks and to develop new tests and treatments. We also know that the fundamental processes involved in CJD, where one of the bodys own proteins becomes misshapen and then forms large clumps of material, are very relevant to other much commoner diseases such as Alzheimers Disease. ||Evidence in support of the involvement of non- PRNP genetic factors comes in part from work with laboratory inbred mouse strains, detailed in this groups section. A small number (~5) of quantitative trait loci (QTL) responsible for determining incubation time following intra-cerebral inoculation with prions have been mapped by the MRC Prion Unit and others using different crossing strategies and prion strains. The integration of unbiased genome-wide strategies in mouse and human prion disease will be an important in the success of both programs. Our discovery research utilises recently available genome-wide genotyping technologies. We have successfully conducted a pilot genome-wide association study with EA-Affymetrix 500K arrays (Mead et al. Lancet Neurology 2009). The necessary molecular genetic, bioinformatic, and statistical genetic expertise for genome-wide association study is either available in the Unit or through collaboration. Over the next few years we expect to develop our discovery genome-wide association research in larger patient cohorts using more advanced genotyping technologies, and focus on developing cellular and animal models to test the genes identified in our discovery research. It has become increasingly apparent that neurodegenerative diseases share fundamental mechanisms involving protein misfolding, including Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons disease. It is likely that genetic modifiers of prion pathogenesis may be of broader relevance to other protein misfolding diseases, and we intend to explore these possibilities.|One of the key goals of bioinfomatics in the Unit is to identity modifier genes, pathways and mechanisms controlling prion pathogenesis. The objective of this aspect of the programme is to use computational and statistical methods for the analysis and integration of these Unit based large-scale experiments (and also externally generated data sets) and their resulting data sets, which are large, inherently noisy and do not produce necessarily clear candidates.

Though management of high glucose levels at this late stage of pregnancy is a routine practice, it does not abolish the risk to the mother and the baby. Our project aims to detect women at higher risk of GDM early in pregnancy by studying DNA methylation changes as potent biomarkers. We will also evaluate the effect of lifestyle intervention on epigenetic signatures in the prevention of type 2 diabetes.	DBT/Wellcome Trust India Alliance	CPH Intermediate Fellowship	25185116	INR

It was found that epigenetic processes, especially changes of DNA-methylation, have far reaching effects on fetal development, aging, the development of chronic diseases and tumors. Epigenetic DNA-methylation affects the cytosines of cytosine/guanosine dinucleotides (CpG), which can be methylated at the carbon-5 position of the pyrimidine ring. The methyl-moiety is transferred from S-adenosylmethionine to the cytosine by DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyl-transferases, usually during replication. Although the regulation of the methylation process is still an open question, the involvement of the RAS-RAF-MAPK-pathway is most likely. Methylation of the cytosines affects not only gene transcription and therewith the phenotype of cells and tissues but also the stability of the genome, which is of great importance for tumor progress. Statins as well as bisphosphonates are two of the most used drugs at all. Statins were developed for treatment of lipid disorders, while bisphosphonates were designed for treatment of osteoporosis. Both drugs influence, albeit in different sections, the synthesis of isoprene-moieties, which are required to anchor the "small GTP-binding proteins" at the cell membrane; only then a proper function of the proteins can be expected. The small GTP binding proteins, which include RAS and RAF, are central regulators of cell multiplication, behavior, differentiation and apoptosis. However, because statins affect the same cellular synthetic pathway as bisphosphonates, statins may not only improve lipid metabolism but also ameliorate bone metabolism. While the benefit of bisphosphonates for bone is well established, the impact of statins on bone metabolism is still an open question. The aim of the project is to show that bisphosphonates and statins, which both modulate the RAS/RAF-signal transduction pathway, can influence the epigenetic status of cells. To show this, we will study cell multiplication and apoptosis using biochemical techniques and differentiation by genome-wide gene expression. We assume that interruption of signal transduction by these drugs attenuates the expression of the DNA methylation machinery, leading to changes in the methylation status of the regulatory regions of genes. We expect promoter demethylation of the apoptosis-promoting gene FAS, the regulator of the osteoblastic differentiation DLX5 and the collagen cross-linker protein and tumor suppressor lysyl oxidase (LOX) as well as a concomitant increased expression of these genes. By use of these drugs as well as by other inhibitors of the RAS/FAF-pathway we will learn how epigenetic DNA-methylation is regulated. In addition, recent studies suggest that the methylation status of individual CpGs is important for gene regulation. Therefore, we intend to study the DNA methylation pattern at the level of individual nucleotides and how it is altered by the various drugs. A proof that the two drugs are epigenetically active would have far-reaching consequences. On the one hand, it will lead to a new understanding of the mechanisms of action and secondly a new risk assessment will become necessary as epigenetic modifications can have long-term effects. This is particularly important because both drugs are used for a longer period and minor epigenetic changes may accumulate in tissues. The accumulated epigenetic modifications might lead to significant changes in gene expression and, therefore, might influence physiological metabolic processes.

However, not every person develops dementia, indicating that age-related processes may not inescapably lead to dementia. The elucidation of the processes occurring in aging will likely offer new options to prevent or postpone development of dementia. One key mechanism is cellular senescence, which causes chronic inflammation through the release of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) profile of mediators. PREADAPT builds on the hypothesis that chronic systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation, quantified through a set of SASP mediators, affects the trajectory of senescence occurring in the aging brain, thus allowing prediction of future cognitive decline and dementia. The levels and changes of SASP mediators during aging are modulated by different genetic and environmental factors, thus defining a personalized risk for dementia. By leveraging the individual variability of large existing aged samples, we aim to integrate SASP, genetics, known AD biomarkers, and comorbidities to generate combined risk profiles which will provide personalized information on risk of dementia. To achieve these goals, PREADAPT includes a team of experts in the field of neuroinflammation, epidemiology, genetics, epigenetics, neuropsychology, and clinical research. PREADAPT has access to state-of-the-art methodology and knowhow on inflammatory markers to define a set of SASP mediators derived from preliminary research done by PREADAPT members. PREADAPT also has access to large epidemiological and clinical follow-up studies that are characterized using neuroimaging, genomics, and proteomics. This unique configuration will enable PREADAPT to identify age-related profiles to inform the personalized future risk of cognitive decline and dementia. From a translational perspective, PREADAPT will also provide first evidence showing that a SASP personalized risk profile responds to specific intervention.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive histological subtype characterized by poor clinical outcome and a shortage of targeted treatment options. The hypoxia is considered as a major hallmark of TNBC, and it offers an environment which promotes selection of more aggressive and chemoresistant cells by altering the gene expression program. The alternative splicing generates transcriptome diversity and may contribute to hypoxia-induced gene expression program in TNBC. The interplay between hypoxia and alternative splicing in TNBC in largely unexplored area and needs further investigation. As epigenetics plays a crucial role in cellular response to hypoxia and alternative splicing is also regulated by epigenetic changes, it is possible that hypoxia-induced pathway regulates alternative splicing due to epigenetic modifications. We will utilize TNBC cell lines, clinical samples as well as cell line model of step-wise transformation to investigate how hypoxia-induced epigenetic changes modulate alternative splicing in TNBC. The overall aim of this proposal is to understand the hypoxia-mediated regulation of alternative pre-mRNA splicing which may contribute to tumorigenesis and chemoresistance bolstered by hypoxia in TNBC. It will help us to understand how certain individuals are more resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs than others and how hypoxia-associated alternative splicing contributes to tumorigenesis in TNBC.
