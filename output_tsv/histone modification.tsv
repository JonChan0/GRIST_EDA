Currently the dissection of the roles of individual modified histone lysine residues is limited by low activity and/or specificities of isolated/recombinant histone acetyl transferases (HATs). We propose to combine directed evolution with biochemical and in vivo assays to understand the functional consequences of modifying specific lysine residues. Initially, we will use natural HATs (EsaI and MOF) as starting points to evolve novel HATs that have enhanced activities and altered specificities to probe biological function.

1	Professor Jenkins	University of Glasgow	None	None	None	The UVR8 UV-B-specific signalling pathway	UV-B wavelengths (280-320 nm) induce physiological responses in plants, but very little is known about the processes of UV-B perception and signal transduction. We have recently discovered that the Arabidopsis protein UVR8 is a UV-B- specific signalling component that mediates a range of gene expression responses involved in secondary metabolism, anti- oxidant defence and UV-protection and have shown that UVR8 associates with chromatin to regulate the expression of a key target gene, encoding the transcription factor HY5. In addition, we have found that UV-B stimulates the rapid nuclear translocation of UVR8. The first objectives of this project are to define sequences in the N-terminal region of UVR8 that are involved in nuclear translocation and to identify proteins that mediate this process. Second, we will define sequences in the C-terminal region of UVR8 required for function in transcriptional regulation and identify proteins that act with UVR8 in this process. Finally we will start to map sites of UVR8 interaction and UV-B-induced histone modification in the HY5 genomic region.

Important aspects of endosperm development are regulated by imprinting. Work in the applicant's lab on maize has demonstrated that for a key gene pair (fie1 and fie2; duplicated versions of the Arabidopsis FIE sequence) belonging to the Polycomb Group (Pc-G), imprinting is regulated through 5' differentially methylated regions (DMRs) similar to those found in mammals. Surprisingly the paternal (silenced) copy of fie1 is methylated in the male gamete, while the male version of fie2 only becomes methylated in the primary endosperm cell after fertilisation. The two fie genes thus appear to be differently regulated. In mammals DMRs represent only a single component of a number of complex imprinting pathways, which involve histone modifications, Pc- G complexes, inhibitory proteins and non-coding RNAs. While the picture for plants appears simpler, the fact that the paternal allele of the fie2 sequence is methylated after fertilisation strongly indicates that the DMR is somehow marked in the gamete. In animals DMRs are generally marked by histone modification and also the binding of Pc-G proteins. Such changes also occur in plant chromatin but their significance in imprinting is unknown. Importantly, recent data suggest that Pc-G proteins self-regulate, and thereby control key aspects of imprinting. We shall first investigate the necessity of DMR methylation for imprinting by monitoring allele-specific methylation and expression of 'imprinted' fie reporter constructs in genetic backgrounds defective either in methlation and histone modification, Then, using RNAi to knock down key methylation and histone methylases in the primary endosperm cell, we shall explore the nature and function of any non-methyl marks on the fie2 and fie2 DMRs. Finally, using a downscaled ChIP protocol, we shall (i) identify histone modifications associated with these DMRs, and (ii) explore the putative autoregulatory roles of Pc-G proteins.

These modifications, directly or indirectly, alter DNA packaging and can thereby regulate gene expression. The enzymes that modify histones can be activated or inhibited by metabolic and environmental variables. Some depend on common metabolites such as NAD, while others are inhibited by common environmental or dietary components, such as short chain fatty acids. The nucleosome is a sensor through which environmental and metabolic changes influence genomic function. In the present research we ask whether environmentally-induced changes in histone modification can induce long-term, heritable changes in patterns of gene expression. Cancer is known to be induced by a variety of environmental toxins, generally thought to operate by causing genetic mutations, ie. changes in DNA. We will ask whether environmental variables can also cause heritable changes in expression of key genes (oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes) by altering histone modifications, providing an epigenetic route to cancer initiation or progression.. As model systems to study the induction of histone modifications and their heritability, we will use mouse embryos grown in culture and mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. We will focus on mechanisms by which genes on one X chromosome are heritably inactivated during differentiation of female ES cells. We will use X inactivation to explore the possible link between histone modifications catalyzed by polycomb group proteins and DNA methylation, often aberrant on numerous genes in cancer. To define patterns of histone modification across selected genes we will use chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), assaying precipitated DNA either by Real Time Quantitative PCR for analysis of key genes or with DNA microarrays to provide genome-wide assay of levels of DNA methylation, histone modification and enzyme distribution during ES cell differentiation. Using a novel technique that allows ChIP data to be obtained from as few as 100 cells (CChIP), we are able to study epigenetic changes in primary cells. We will follow environmentally-induced changes in defined cell populations (eg Inner Cell Mass, trophectoderm) from the developing embryo and in small clusters of cells excised from tissue sections by laser capture. In collaborative work, we will use the latter approach us to look for epigenetic changes in cells of defined type, either cancerous or normal, from sections taken from colon cancers at different stages of development and from premalignant tissue.

5	Professor Bryan Turner	University of Birmingham	Medical Sciences - Medicine	2004-11-01	2008-03-31	Epigenetics of heterochromatin formation and gene silencing in human embryonic stem cells	Human Embryonic Stem Cells (HESC) can be directed to progress down specific pathways of differentiation, and thereby generate cells committed to defined lineages. Such cells are potentially capable of repairing or replacing damaged tissue when transplanted into patients. As in all other living systems, the progression of HESC down pathways of differentiation is driven by changing patterns of gene expression. These genetic events are regulated by epigenetic mechanisms that switch defined genes on and off at particular stages, and also maintain the on and off states through successive cell generations. In higher eukaryotes, both switching and maintenance mechanisms are profoundly influenced by the packaging of DNA into the cell nucleus as chromatin. It is now clear that chromatin, and hence gene expression, can be altered in complex and subtle ways through the actions of an ever increasing number of enzymes, some of which modify the major DNA packaging proteins, and some of which modify DNA itself. An improved understanding of these fundamental epigenetic events is the central aim of the present proposal, and is an essential first step in fully exploiting the scientific and therapeutic potential of HESC. The project has four specific aims: (i) To establish and characterise new HESC lines using blastocysts from the Assisted Conception Unit at Birmingham Womens? Hospital NHS Trust. (ii) To determine the patterns of histone modification that mark specific genes (autosomal and X-linked) and chromosome domains in the cells of the Inner Cell Mass and how these modifications change in HESC, both before and after differentiation in culture. We will use antibody-based approaches pioneered in the Birmingham lab, primarily Indirect ImmunoFluorescence (IIF) microscopy of metaphase chromosomes and Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation (ChIP). By comparing our results with data from the Human Genome project on the distribution of genes across chromosomes, we can build up a detailed picture of the epigenetic marks carried by particular genomic regions at different stages of development and differentiation. (iii) To elucidate the sequence of epigenetic events that specifies long-term transcriptional silencing of female X-linked genes and the maturation of constitutive heterochromatin during differentiation of HESC. This will be achieved using the same antibody-based approaches as ii. (iv) To identify enzymes responsible for histone modifications on Xi by studying their genomic localisation and by developing procedures, applicable to HESC, for their down-regulation by RNAi.

6	Professor Bryan Turner	University of Birmingham	None	2012-06-01	2016-03-31	Exploring the metaphase epigenome in normal and leukaemic cells	Background By immunostaining of metaphase chromosome spreads from human lymphoblastoid cell lines, we have recently shown that histones carrying specific post-translational modifications vary widely in concentration from one chromosome region to another. This variation gives each chromosome a characteristic fluorescent banding pattern after immunostaining with the appropriate antibodies. The processes by which these bands are put in place are not understood. Some modifications are closely associated with genomic features such as gene and CpG island density, but the extent to which bands are determined by DNA sequence or non-genetic factors (eg. enzyme or metabolite levels) remains uncertain. Nor do we know in any detail how the banding patterns vary from one cell type to another. Aims A preliminary screen will compare immunofluorescent metaphase banding patterns in normal and leukaemic blood cells stimulated to grow in short term culture. The screen takes advantage of the large number of primary blood and bone marrow samples cultured in the West Midlands Regions Genetics Laboratory (WMRGL) for leukaemia diagnosis and monitoring. The initial focus will be on Acute Myeloid Leukaemia patients with known translocations and Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia, and will compare normal and leukaemic cells in the same spreads. Other leukaemias and cells from non-cancer patients will be added as the work progresses. In parallel, we will explore at high resolution the genome-wide changes in histone modification that occur as cultured human lymphoblastoid cells move into mitosis. This will provide a first indication of how the major cell cycle dependent redistribution of histone modifications suggested by our immunolabelling results, is manifest at the gene and sub-genic level. Methods Immunofluorescence microscopy of metaphase chromosome spreads using antibodies to modified histones will be carried out using procedures established in the Birmingham labs. Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation (ChIP) linked to Next Generation sequencing (on the in-house SOLiD 4 sequencer) will be used to explore chromatin remodelling as cells enter mitosis. The enzymes involved will be identified using sh/si-RNA mediated knockdown. How the results of this research will be used If disruption of immunofluorescent banding patterns is detected in specific leukaemias, this will open the way to novel diagnostic and prognostic tests. Understanding the mechanisms by which immunofluorescent chromosome bands are put in place may provide insights into the processes that generate the chromosome abnormalities that characterize so many cancers.

This concentration is achieved by enclosing molecules in membranes (as in mitochondria) or through the formation of local clusters (as in the machinery for oxidative phosphorylation). Clustering plays an important role in transcription. For example, our previous work has shown that HeLa nuclei contain a large and dispersed pool of RNA polymerase II present at ~1 micromolar but a small fraction is found in clusters where the local concentration is ~1,000-fold higher; as a result, few ? if any ? mRNAs are made outside the clusters. Moreover, many other components involved in making mature messages are also found in the clusters, which we call transcription ?factories?. Our purpose here is characterize these active sites in detail. Using mammalian cells grown in tissue culture, we plan to: (i) establish the basic micro-architecture of factories using high-resolution light and electron microscopy, localizing in and around factories components of the various machineries that generate mature messages (including those involved in transcription, processing, checking the quality of the newly-made transcript, chromatin remodeling, and histone modification), (ii) examine how factories change as transcription increases or decreases (e.g., as embryonic stem cells differentiate), and (iii) analyze the protein content of factories and the degree to which they specialize using novel methods that enable us to determine which proteins are associated with nascent RNA. Ultimately, we hope to discover what leads to the incorporation of a gene into a factory so that it can be expressed. We believe this combination of approaches will enable us to uncover mechanisms that are difficult to detect using a purely reductionist approach. We also hope that a fuller understanding of these factories will eventually lead to improved treatments for many of the serious diseases (e.g., cancer, diabetes, heart disease) that can result from failures in transcriptional control.

Scientific Abstract|This study will translate molecular pathophysiology studies from our group identifying peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) -gamma as a potential drug target in asthma. The key question is whether stimulation of PPAR-gamma receptors produce measurable biological airway and clinical responses in patients with asthma that would justify exploring PPAR-gamma stimluation as a novel therapeutic modality|DESIGN - Randomized, double blind, placebo controlled two parallel group clinical trial |SETTING - Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust|TARGET POPULATION - People aged 18-75 of either sex with a clinical diagnosis of asthma, FEV1 60 % predicted or higher and an increase in FEV1 of greater than 12 % following inhaled salbutamol 400mcg or PEF variability > 12 % during run-in taking 0 to 800 mcg inhaled beclometasone diproprionate or equivalent and as required short acting beta agonist. The exclusion criteria will be inability to produce a sputum sample on induction, current smoking, > 10 pack years smoking history, treatment with leukotriene antagonists, liver or cardiovascular disease, oral steroid treatment or exacerbation within 6 weeks, females who are pregnant, lactating or not using adequate contraception, any contra-indication to pioglitazone and lactose intolerance. |INTERVENTIONS BEING EVALUATED - Active intervention: 30 mg pioglitazone daily for 4 weeks, increasing to 45 mg pioglitazone daily for 8 weeks. Placebo intervention: placebo matching 30 mg pioglitazone daily for 4 weeks followed by placebo matching 45 mg pioglitazone daily for 8 weeks. Participants will be randomised to one or other intervention using a web-based randomisation system and allocation concealed by blinding of participants and investigators. |MEASUREMENT OF CLINICAL OUTCOMES AND DURATION OF FOLLOW-UP - Primary outcome: FEV1 at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes: daily asthma symptoms, mean morning and evening PEF, Juniper Asthma Control Questionnaire and Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire scores, exhaled nitric oxide level, bronchial hyper-responsiveness, induced sputum cell counts & analysis detailed below, BMI, glucose & adverse effects. Follow up will take place at 0, 4, 8, 12, & 16 weeks for data collection. |ADDITIONAL LABORATORY OUTCOMES - Our previous studies have suggested that the mechanism of action of PPAR-gamma agonists in vitro involves effects on gene transcription. Gene transcription is a complex process involving binding of transcription factors to their recognition sequences on gene promoters. Access to these recognition sequences requires DNA to unravel and this process is controlled by covalent modification of core histone molecules around which DNA is wrapped. |The most important covalent modification is acetylation of histone H4 which is regulated by two competing groups of enzymes, histone acetyl transferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). HATs increase transcription whereas HDACs reduce it. In our studies of eotaxin we found that acetylation of histone H4 was reduced by PPAR agonists but we have not determined whether this is due to a reduced HAT or increased HDAC activity. |To examine things further we will perform studies in cells obtained from induced sputum to analyse 1) HDAC and HAT activities by HDAC Fluorescent Activity Assay Kit (BIOMOL) and HAT Assay Kit (Upstate Biotechnology). We have shown from preliminary experiments that we can obtain enough cells from induced sputum for these assays. 2) PPAR-gamma activation (nuclear translocation) by western blotting. |This will be conducted on a subset of samples from each group to confirm the effect of pioglitazone. We will also perform studies in supernatant obtained from induced sputum to analyse 1) the concentration of chemokines (eotaxin, MCP-1, IP-10) and growth factors (VEGF) by ELISA; 2) effector mediators (cyst-leukotriens, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and histamine) by radio-immuno assay. |These analyses will be conducte	Medical Research Council	P&Cs	123931.0	GBP

We recently showed, using recombinant Epstein-Barr viruses from which individual EBNA3s were deleted, that EBNA3A and EBNA3C functionally interact to repress the expression of the cellular gene BIM. Coincidentally we discovered that the BIM promoter exhibits CpG methylation in all the B cells carrying latent EBV that we examined. It appears that EBV can initiate epigenetic silencing and CpG methylation of BIM and perhaps other cellular genes. Our aim is to systematically investigate genome-wi de CpG methylation and histone modification patterns after infection of B cells (EBV-negative Burkitt s lymphoma and CD19+ve primary cells) with EBV. This should reveal cellular genes that are epigenetically modified by latent EBV gene products. Prototypic B95.8 EBV and the EBNA3-deletion viruses will be used, so the roles of these EBV repressors of transcription in modifying the B cell epigenome and gene expression patterns will be determined. In addition to using genome-wide tiled-arrays to an alyse approximately 25,500 promoters for DNA methylation and histone modifications (such as H3K9 methylation), the same viruses and cells will be used for standard microarray expression analyses. We will also assess the role of the EBNA3s in the epigenetic silencing of viral gene expression thought to be necessary for persistence in vivo.	Wellcome Trust	Project Grant	284612.0	GBP
10	Professor Tony Kouzarides	University of Cambridge	None	2004-09-01	2009-08-31	Transcriptional regulation by cancer genes	Our current efforts are concentrated on the identification and characterisation of enzymes which modify chromatin. The aim is to understand how modifications on histones mediate changes in transcription and to establish the role of the enzymes in normal cells and in the genesis of cancer. Recently we have been investigating the function of histone methylation. We have identified HP1 as a protein which recognises methyl lysine 9 of histone H3, a modification mediated by the SUV39 histone methyltransferase. Experiments in yeast show that the methylation at lysine 9 and the subsequent recruitment of HP1 is essential for the transcriptional repression at centromeric heterochromatin. In addition, we have found that the SUV39/HP1 methylation complex is involved in the transcriptional repression mechanism mediated by the Retinoblastoma protein, RB. The RB protein can target XUV39 and HP1 to E2F regulated promoters, such as cyclin E, to repress activity. Our efforts now are directed towards the identification of novel methyltransferases. Novel enzymatic activities have been found in SET domain proteins in yeast. One such protein, ySET1, has been identified as a histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase. Genetic and biochemical analysis indicates that ySET1 is an activator of transcription and that methylation at lysine 4 results in the displacement of the RPD3 deacetylase from histone H3.

Importantly, we have identified the enzyme performing this modification as Nop1/fibrillarin, a methyltransferase previously implicated in ribosome biogenesis.. Finally, we have found that methylation of H2AQ105 inhibits FACT binding to nucleosomes. FACT is a key player in chromatin biology and is responsible for transition of polymerases through chromatinized DNA. We want to better understand the influence of H2A Q105 methylation on the recruitment of FACT to chromatin and the effect on the cell by modifying the chromatin structure. To address the mechanistic aspects of this project, we will will employ a combination of biochemical assays (in vitro assays usingrecombinantly purified components), biophysical approaches (Biacore and potentially crystallization) and yeast genetics. To gain an understanding into the impact of this pathway on cells, we will use mammalian tissue culture for e.g. immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies. We will integrate these classical approaches with high-throughput sequencing of chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. This will enable us to better understand the consequences of the modification on the underlying chromatin, e.g. the genomic localization of H2AQ105 methylation and its effect on chromatin structure and chromatin-related processes. Finally, biochemistry coupled with mass spectrometry will provide insight in to the regulation of Nop1. The enzyme has roles in at least two different biological pathways and we would like to understand 1) how modification of Nop1/fibrillarin controls different pathways and 2) identify co-factors (proteins and RNA) of Nop1/fibrillarin.

Changes in the chromatin structure play a key role in the regulation of the mammalian DNA, controlling many cellular processes including transcription, replication and repair. Eukaryotic chromatin is regulated by a number of modification enzymes including histone methylases, phosphorylases and acetylases. Little is known about whether or not such modifications occur in prokaryotes. We are interested in understanding more about the enzymes that regulate bacterial chromatin. We have recently discovered two bacterial proteins that resemble eukaryotic histone modification enzymes. The major aim of this proposal is to establish whether these bacterial enzymes modify bacterial chromatin to regulate the dynamics of DNA structure, and if so, what does it also tell us about the function of these proteins in the eukarya.

Specifically, we will determine how two histone modification-targeting domains (PHD and bromodomains) contribute to the function of the conserved ATP-dependent chromatin enzyme NURF. Ablation of Drosophila NURF has been shown to lead to formation of blood tumours. In this project we will: (i). Generate Drosophila NURF mutants lacking histone-targeting domains and determine the contribution of these motifs to blood tumour production, (ii) Perform microarray analysis of these mutants to determine gene targets that require histone modification for recruitment of NURF, (iii) Generate transgenic Drosophila strains that express epitope-tagged variants of NURF (containing or lacking histone-targeting domains), (iv) Determine the global distribution of NURF complexes that contain or lack these domains by chromatin immunopreciptitation followed by hybridization to whole genome tiling-path arrays (ChIP-on-chip). This research will provide insight into the complex interplay between the two principal mechanisms of coding epigenetic information in the nucleus - histone modifications and ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling - and will reveal their contributions to blood tumour production in flies. As NURF is conserved in all higher eukaryotes, information obtained using Drosophila should be directly applicable to humans.	Cancer Research UK	Studentship	None	None
16	Dr Paul Badenhorst	University of Birmingham	None	2009-01-01	2011-12-31	Genome-wide mapping of targets and epigenetic regulators of the chromatin remodelling enzyme NURF	Background Eukaryotic genetic information is stored in chromatin, in which DNA is compacted by being wrapped around a spool of histone proteins to form nucleosomes. During all DNA-templated processes, chromatin undergoes dynamic remodelling to control access to the associated DNA. Chromatin remodelling utilizes several basic mechanisms, including ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling, covalent histone modification and histone variant exchange to alter accessibility to the DNA. ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling enzymes such as the nucleosome remodelling factor (NURF) utilize the energy of ATP hydrolysis to slide nucleosomes along DNA. By sliding nucleosomes, NURF can alternatively expose or block transcription factor binding sites, and thus activate or repress transcription. Relevance to cancer Mutation of Drosophila NURF interferes with hematopoietic development, causing blood tumours. NURF binds a specific post-translationally-modified histone (H3K4(Me)3), which is proposed to recruit NURF to gene targets. In addition, acetylation of histone H4 at Lys16 can regulate the in vitro activity of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers. Both modifications have been linked to cancer. MLL, the enzyme that establishes H3K4(Me)3, is implicated in 80% of acute myeloid or lymphoblastic leukemias, while loss of H4K16Ac a common hallmark of human cancers. In addition, we have shown that disruption of the variant histone H2A.Z recapitulates NURF blood tumour phenotypes. In this proposal we will determine how cross-talk between histone variant exchange and histone post-translational modifications control NURF-activity in vivo. Because NURF is conserved between Drosophila and humans, this information will help to understand the functions of the corresponding human NURF complex and its potential involvement in leukemias and cancer. This knowledge is vital as ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling factors are potential drug targets in the fight against these diseases. Aims and methods In this proposal we will identify the in vivo chromatin targets of NURF and investigate how NURF activity at these promoters is influenced by histone post-translational modification and variant histone incorporation. Building upon previous work showing that Drosophila NURF represses the JAK/STAT pathway and prevents blood tumours we will:- i. Determine chromatin targets of NURF by mapping genome-wide changes in nucleosome position that occur in NURF mutant blood cells. ii. Use massively-parallel signature sequencing in combination with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChiP-Seq) to determine the genome-wide distribution of NURF complexes. iii. Use ChIP-Seq to determine how histone post-translational modifications and the variant histone H2A.Z affect recruitment and activity of NURF. iv. Determine functions of the histone variant H2A.Z in blood tumor production.	Cancer Research UK	Project Award	None	None

Accordingly, deficiencies in the Polycomb system are important in disease, notably in several types of cancer. Although it is established that the effector function of PcG proteins is in large part attributable to intrinsic histone modification activities, the mechanisms that target PcG proteins to defined loci remain poorly understood. A number of different models have been proposed in order to account for PcG targeting to CpG islands at the promoters of target genes, the inactive X chromosome, and in defined circumstances, to pericentric constitutive heterochromatin. Our recent studies, and those of others, have highlighted that underlying chromatin state and DNA methylation play an important role, and based on this we have developed a general model that can account for PcG localisation at all target loci. The central aim of this proposal is to test the general model and to determine the mechanisms by which underlying chromatin states dictate PcG factor binding. In a series of integrated experiments we will define chromatin modifications on mononucleosomes purified from PcG target loci, determine the activity of major PcG complexes in vitro using nucleosome templates assembled with recombinant histones/histone variants bearing specific chromatin modifications, and, using a novel photo-cross-linking strategy, define, at the atomic level, interactions of PcG complexes with chromatin templates in vitro. Finally, based on our findings we will establish de novo PcG target sites in cells and/or disrupt preexisting PcG target sites. These studies will help to define the fundamental mechanisms that determine PcG protein targeting, and in addition will provide insight into misregulation of PcG proteins in disease.

We aim to investigate the interactions, functions and targets of the mammalian chromosomal protein PSIP1/LEDGF. This protein has recently attracted attention because of its role in guiding the integration of HIV-1, and other lentiviruses, into preferred sites in the host genome. However, there has been little study of the normal cellular function of this protein. We identified Psip1 as a chromosome-associated protein in a gene-trap screen and the phenotypes that resulted from Psip1 disruption in mutant mice led us to suggest that Psip1 may act in the polycomb pathway of chromatin-mediated gene regulation. Using Psip1 mutant cells and animals, together with antibodies that recognise and immunoprecipitate the different isoforms of Psip1, we propose to investigate the other nuclear proteins that Psip1 interacts with and to test whether Psip1 binds to a specific histone modification. Finally, downstream transcriptional targets of Psip1 will be investigated though expression microarray and real-time RT-PCR comparison of wild-type and mutant cells and by chromatin-immunoprecipitation of Psip1 genomic binding sites.

Clearly this involves the interaction of key cis-elements (e.g. enhancers, promoters and silencers) with trans-acting proteins (e.g. transcription factors, co-activators, adaptors and chromatin modifiers) that give rise to changes in gene expression which are associated with changes in epigenetic modification (methylation, replication, histone modification and nuclear position). We now need to understand the hierarchy and order of these events in gene regulation. We are studying expression of the a globin cluster in its natural chromosome environment during erythropoiesis as a model of mammalian gene expression. Our ultimate aim is to develop a comprehensive understanding of how mammalian genes are expressed from (or silenced within) their normal chromosomal environment and use this information to improve the management of patients with mutations in the globin genes that cause the human genetic disease thalassaemia. Ultimately any hypotheses about how the a globin genes are regulated have to be tested in experimental systems and at present this is achieved using interspecific hybrids in erythroid cells, stable transfectants of erythroid cells, transgenic mice and the use of ES cells to generate mice that have been modified using homologous recombination. We have recently developed a humanised mouse model that will allow us to study the human alpha cluster in a mouse background. Allowing functional studies that fully complement analysis of the transcriptional and epigenetic programmes. Over the past few years we have established high throughput assays to analyse all aspects of the transcriptional and epigenetic programmes controlling globin gene expression and we are now applying the principles learnt from globin to the entire human genome. Our ultimate aim is to develop a comprehensive understanding of how mammalian genes are expressed from their normal chromosomal environment and use this information to improve the management of patients with mutations in the globin genes that cause thalassaemia and related disorders.

Mutation or modification of the INK locus has been found to be the second most frequent perturbation in cancer. Thus, there is great interest in genes such as CBX7 that regulate the INK locus. CBX7 is a member of the large polycomb group of proteins, originally identified in Drosophila. They are thought to act, at least in part, through histone modification in target loci and thus can set up epigenetic chromatin modifications that are heritable through cell division and animal development. Our initial observations suggest that CBX7 is itself an oncogene, that associates with a newly identified histone methyl transferase. In this proposal we have five specific objectives. The role of CBX7 in oncogenic transformation. This will extend our initial observation that CBX7 can act as an oncogene in the mouse immune system, in continuing mouse work but also by analysis of human tumours. Mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by CBX7. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies indicate that CBX7 acts through histone methylation at the INK locus. We will define the relevant target DNA elements required, identify further proteins that function with CBX7 (see below) and evaluate their biological roles. Analysis of CBX7 function in vivo. The closest functional relative of CBX7 is the Bmi1 polycomb protein, that also acts at the INK locus. Loss-of-function Bmi causes, inter alia, defects in stem cell renewal. Thus we will do a variety of CBX7 mouse knock-out studies and with appropriate genetic crosses elaborate the role of this gene in normal development and in adult life. Comparative dissection of the composition of Pc containing complexes. A variety of approaches will be taken to identify proteins, other than those we have already identified, that act in concert with CBX7 in gene regulation. Role of other PcG in oncogenesis. In silico and other approaches have led us to five polycomb group proteins that are likely oncogenes, in common with CBX7 and Bmi1. These will be explored, genetically and biochemically.

However, in order to better understand the pathobiology of PD and to ultimately progress to the development of improved therapies, it is now essential that we understand the biological consequences of these susceptibility alleles. Post-translational modifications of histone proteins (hPTM) are an important class of epigenetic modification that control the extent to which chromatin is condensed (heterochromatin) or relaxed (euchromatin). Genotype-epigenetic interactions are relevant to a number of complex disorders, and in a Parkinson’s UK funded grant (G-1309) our preliminary analysis of DNA methylation suggests that it is also relevant to PD. As DNA methylation and hPTM are largely independent biological mechanisms it is important that we now investigate hPTM in relationship to PD. In this project we will therefore conduct a well-powered study to determine whether hPTM are correlated with well-established PD susceptibility loci in pathologically relevant post mortem brain tissue. Moreover, we will also investigate whether previously implicated biological pathways are enriched for changes in hPTM. As hPTM are potentially reversible using drugs that cross the blood brain barrier they are particularly tractable to therapeutic interventions for PD. Identifying hPTMs correlated with disease in the degenerating regions of the brains of PD patients could facilitate the development of improved drugs that target disease relevant changes in hPTM. It is therefore possible that our analyses will highlight novel targets for therapeutic interventions for PD.	Parkinson's UK	Project grant	232404.0	GBP

Extracellular signals are transmitted from the cell surface to the nucleus, where transcription factors regulate gene expression with the help of associated chromatin modifying enzymes. Activation of stress and mitogen activated kinase cascades ultimately leads to specific marks at nucleosomes through phosphorylation of serine 10 on histone H3. During the last years, H3S10 phosphorylation has been linked as part of the nucleosomal response to the transcriptional activation of numerous mammalian genes. In addition, phosphorylation of H3S28 was shown to correlate with gene activation in response to different stimuli. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which the phosphorylated histone H3 is recognized and how the signals are conveyed to the RNA Pol II machinery. We and others have recently identified two members of the 14-3-3 family, 14-3-3 epsilon and zeta, as H3S10ph binding modules. Interestingly, additional acetylation of the neighboring lysine residues K9 or K14 significantly increases the affinity of 14-3-3 for S10 phosphorylated histone H3 suggesting that 14-3-3 recognizes multiple modifications on the H3 tail. In addition, 14-3-3 strongly binds to the H3S28ph mark in in vitro binding assays. In response to extracellular signals, 14-3-3 is recruited to the promoters of specific target genes and in knockdown experiments we have demonstrated that the presence of 14-3-3 is crucial for gene activation of these genes. During the last years, we have created valuable tools such as 14-3-3 and histone modification specific antibodies and stable cell lines expressing TAP-tagged 14-3-3 and myc-tagged histone H3 isoforms. Using these tools, we intend to analyze the impact of histone H3 phosphorylation and 14-3-3 recruitment on gene regulation in mouse fibroblasts. By TAP-tag affinity purification of associated factors, knockdown studies and ChIP assays, we will unravel the molecular function of 14-3-3 in chromatin-dependent regulation of gene expression. 14-3-3 binds to both phosphorylated serine 10 and serine 28 albeit with different affinity. Published data indicate that the two modifications target different pools of nucleosomes. We have established a system, in which histone H3 phosphorylation can be triggered by activation of stress-induced MAP kinase cascades and have identified target genes by gene expression profiling. By ChIP sequencing, we will examine genome-wide histone H3 phosphorylation at serine 10 and serine 28 in response to stress and correlate these data with the identified target genes. To understand the regulatory mechanisms we will examine genome-wide recruitment of 14-3-3 and RNA polymerase II and the effect of MAP kinase signaling on H3 acetylation and transcription factors by quantitative ChIP analysis. Our project will significantly contribute to our understanding of transcription control by a mechanism that integrates phosphorylation signals at the level of the nucleosome. In addition to core histones, several other proteins involved in signal transduction, apoptosis and tumor suppression show multiple modifications that are regulated in a well-orchestrated manner and define the biological function of the target protein. Thus, the crosstalk of multiple modifications on histone H3 might be a paradigm for a more general protein modification code and the outcome of this study will therefore be of general interest for the scientific community.

A major bottle-neck for the ADP-ribosylation field is the lack of an experimental model in which ADP-ribosylation sites can be mutated at endogenous histone loci to decipher the molecular basis of how these modifications regulate DNA repair. The ability to manipulate histone genes in Dictyostelium offers a unique platform to address these questions. Established mass spectrometry (MS) approaches will identify specific sites on Dictyostelium histones ADP-ribosylated in response to DSBs in vivo. Gene replacement technology will introduce mutations at these sites identified by MS into endogenous histone genes, to generate histone ADP-ribosylation defective strains. The ability of these strains to perform DSB repair will be assessed using standard assays including plasmid integration assays to determine NHEJ and HR efficiencies, sensitivity to DNA damage, enrichment of repair factors at damage sites. These strains offer a rigorously controlled platform to identify factors that interact with ADP-ribosylated histones, which can then be extended to humans. Immunoprecipitation of nucleosome complexes from wild-type and histone ADP-ribosylation defective strains will identify factors that specifically interact with ADP-ribosylated histones by comparative MS. The orthologues of novel proteins identified in Dictyostelium will be verified by enrichment at DSBs in human cells, disrupted by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, and the functional consequences on human DSB repair assessed using standard assays, including repair efficiencies, enrichment of repair factors at DSBs etc.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	397181.0	GBP

To investigate the effects of drug-like molecules that can reverse these PTMs on growth and functions of a panel of breast cancer cell lines. Last updated / / Tumour cells exhibit widespread alterations in the prevalence of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of chromatin and chromatin-associated proteins. This results in aberrant gene expression that contributes to the pathogenesis of cancer. Recent tumour microarray (TMA) studies have revealed a reduction in selected histone æmarksÆ in breast and prostate tumours that correlate with poor clinical outcome. The mechanism is likely to involve altered activity of the enzymes that impart PTMs such as the deacetylases, acetyltransferases and methyltransferases. This project will investigate chromatin modifications and expression of histone modifying enzymes and their coregulators in TMAs representing 880 well-characterised tumour samples. We will focus on HAT and HDAC proteins in the H4K16 regulatory axis, i.e. the NAD-dependent HDAC SIRT1 and MYST domain HATs, as well as their coregulators such as AROS, ING and DBC proteins. In parallel, we will assess the effects of small molecule inhibitors of these enzymes on breast cancer cell lines, to generate proof of principle evidence for novel therapeutic strategies.

The proposed experiments will investigate the higher-order structure (chromosome folding) and functional nuclear organization (placement in the nucleus) of genes during transcriptional activity and inactivity. We have found that widely separated genes on the same chromosome often co-localize when they are transcriptionally active, at frequencies much higher than would be expected by random association. Taken together with published reports, which show high chromatin mobility, individual genes adopting distinct nuclear localizations in association with transcriptional activity and nuclear sub-compartments rich in transcriptional apparatus, these data suggest that gene activity is controlled in part by nuclear organization. We have shown that the beta-globin genes and the distal beta-globin locus control region physically associate in vivo during the process of transcription. This higher-order structure appears to be dependent on modifications to the histone tails of chromatin in sub-domains encompassing the developmentally specific genes. These modifications in turn are dependent on intergenic transcription through the subdomain region suggesting that the process of transcription or the presence of the non-coding RNA targets remodelling and histone modification factors to the sub-domains. However another non-exclusive hypothesis is that intergenic transcription itself is involved in the assembly of higher-order structures by acting as a molecular motor to pull distal regions into functional complexes. We will investigate these models and attempt to determine a hierarchy of events that take place in the normal control of gene expression. We will use state-of-the-art techniques such as RNA TRAP, 3C, and 3D confocal RNA and DNA FISH to assess higher-order chromatin structures as well as coordinate nuclear organization of genes as far apart as 40 Mb. In addition we will develop a high-throughput assay to rapidly build up information about the functional organization of the nucleus from numerous genomic perspectives. This information is vital to understanding normal gene function as well as in cases were genes are deregulated as in cancer.	Medical Research Council	Fellowship	1050561.0	GBP

Together, DNA and histone marks form an epigenetic code that holds the clues to understanding cell differentiation and lineage specification in normal development, as well as the disease states of genomic imprinting, Rett syndrome and cancer. Somatic cell nuclear transfer experiments have demonstrated that the epigenetic memory of heritable DNA methylation and chromatin states in differentiated cells is not easily erased in order to restore developmental potential, and that incorrect nuclear reprogramming leads to developmental failure. This has refocused attention on understanding the natural nuclear reprogramming process that with each new generation reinstates totipotency in the fertilised zygote. Demethylation of DNA is thought to be necessary for the activation of essential developmental genes. Rapid DNA demethylation of the mouse male pronucleus with passive DNA demethylation of the female genome in subsequent cell divisions was taken to indicate that nuclear reprogramming constitutes the global removal of epigenetic marks. This striking pronuclear asymmetry and demethylation dynamics is not conserved in other mammals, however, an observation at odds with the evolutionary conserved developmental context. Hypothesising that sperm chromatin variability in protamines, histones, variants and epigenetic modifications can explain these differences, we will investigate elements of somatic and zygotic chromatin structure that delimit the nuclear reprogramming process and determine its epigenetic outcome.

These complex networks consist of transcription factors, which are largely conserved across animal phyla, and their target genes. There is growing evidence that epigenetic mechanisms support the function of these transcriptional networks by regulating the accessibility of chromatin throughout development. Basal animal phyla are important models to gain insights into the evolution of transcriptional networks and their interplay with epigenetic modifications, yet no information on epigenetic regulation exists in animals outside the Bilateria. I will study the regulation of gene expression in Nematostella vectensis, which represents a sister group to the Bilateria. I plan to determine the genome-wide distribution of a Polycomb mediated histone modification to investigate if Polycomb mediated repression of developmental regulators is as complex in Nematostella as it is in bilaterian model organisms. I will also use characteristic chromatin signatures previously identified in mammalian cells to map transcriptional regulatory elements throughout the genome. Their functionality will be tested in transgenic Nematostella polyps, and their complexity compared to that in Bilaterians. These studies should provide crucial insights into the evolution of cis-regulatory elements and epigenetic silencing in transcriptional networks and how this contributed to the increasing complexity of animal body plans.

Prof. Dr. Karl KUCHLER	Medical University of Vienna	None	2012-11-01	2016-03-31	Chromatin Modifications in Fungal Virulence and Pathogenesis	In all eukaryotes, the genetic information contained in DNA double strands are packaged around nucleosomes to form chromatin, which regulates numerous pathophysiological processes, ranging from normal development to cancer and infections by microbial pathogens. Chromatin is subject to dynamic post-translational modifications of its core constituents, histone proteins, which modulate chromatin condensation and determine how chromatin exerts its regulatory functions on target genes. The reversible acetylation of lysine residues by a so-called histone acetyltransferase (HAT) is often associated with transcriptional activation, whereas histone deacetylase (HDAC) function is normally associated with gene repression. In all eukaryotes, including the most prevalent dimorphic human fungal pathogen C. albicans, several HATs/HDACs exist that appear to influence morphogenesis. Candida spp are opportunistic pathogens that can cause severe chronic mucocutaneous, as well as invasive candidemia of staggering mortalities exceeding 40% when the host immune surveillance is malfunctioning. Invasive Candida spp are under constant pressure to cope and to evade the host immune surveillance. Chromatin appears to play a major role in fungal pathogenesis, since a changing histone modification status modulates morphogenesis, as well as antifungal drug susceptibility. This determines whether cells grow in unicellular or multicellular filamentous morphologies, both of which interact differently with the host immune cells or colonize distinct host niches. At present, clinically relevant antifungal drugs to cure Candida infections are mainly limited to azoles and to the fungicidal echinocandins, targeting ergosterol and cell wall biogenesis, respectively. However, the potential of specifically inhibiting HDAC/HAT activities as a novel therapeutic strategy is just beginning to be recognized, since filamentation and morphogenesis are considered key virulence traits of C. albicans. While most data on HAT/HDAC functions stem the non-pathogenic yeast S. cerevisiae, still little is known about mechanisms by which HATs/HDACs control virulence in pathogenic fungi. Hence, there is a need to better understand the mechanisms of dual layer regulation that connects transcriptional regulation with dynamic chromatin modifications in response to host immune response. In this FWF project, we will therefore decipher the mechanisms by which the paradigm fungal Hat1/Hat2 HAT, controls DNA repair, and we will answer the question how Hat1/Hat2-mediated chromatin remodelling at respective promoters or other genomic regions specifically controls antifungal drug resistance, virulence and stress response. Moreover, we will address the question how a prototype HDAC in C. albicans, the Set3/Hos2 complex Set3C, regulates target genes necessary for integrating stimuli from signalling pathways that control filamentation, morphogenesis, drug susceptibility and virulence. The project will take advantage of timely genome-wide approaches, including next generation sequencing such as RNA-Seq, Chip-Seq and extensive bioinformatics to identify novel fungal genetic networks whose transcriptional efficiency is subject to control by the histone modifiers Set3C and Hat1/Hat2. The phenotypic consequences of interfering with these regulatory events will be tested in appropriate homozygous C. albicans deletion strains lacking certain HDAC and HAT target genes to be generated by reverse genetics. Virulence properties of HAT/HDAC target genes will be studied ex vivo using primary innate immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, as well as in vivo, using appropriate mouse models of fungal virulence.

The most extensively investigated modification is acetylation, catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases.Our laboratory has recently reported a novel level of regulation of histone deacetylases in maize, namely that the histone deacetylase activity of an ZmHda1 homolog is regulated by limited proteolysis (Pipal et al., 2003). ZmHDA1 is synthesized as an enzymatically inactive protein with an apparent MW of 84,000 which is converted to an enzymatically active 48 kD HDAC by proteolytic removal of the C-terminal part, presumably by the aid of a 65 kD intermediate protein. The enzymatically inactive 84 kD precursor protein is part of a 300 kD complex of unknown composition and function. Only the processed 48 kD protein as a monomer had deacetylase activity and was able to repress transcription efficiently in a reporter gene assay; deacetylase activity of the 48 kD protein was dependent on phosphorylation. Interestingly, Arabidopsis not only contains an Hda1 homologous gene, but also a distinct gene encoding a small protein of 252 amino acids; this small protein is highly related to the C-terminal proteolytic cleavage product of ZmHDA1. The function of this protein is unknown. The regulation of maize HDA1 by limited proteolysis is likely to represent a unique, plant specific level of HDAC regulation, connecting chromatin acetylation and protolytic pathways. Based on these findings the project proposal addresses this novel interconnection by characterization, purification and identification of ZmHDA1 forms and associated complexes. In particular it will focus on: -the purification and identification of proteins associated with ZmHda1-p84 in high molecular weight complexes, -the purification and identification of the protease responsible for conversion of enzymatically inactive ZmHda1-p84 into enzymatically active ZmHda1-p48, -the characterization of the proteolytic cleavage product (p36) and its complex, -the modifications of ZmHDA1-p84, p48 and p36, and -the localization of the relevant proteins and protein complexes in different maize tissues.

To achieve optimal expression of the PU.1 gene at different stages of hematopoiesis, multiple interactions are required between its regulatory elements to form fine chromatin architecture. Preliminary studies have demonstrated a novel mechanism of gene regulation through coordinated expression of the target gene and its regulatory natural noncoding transcripts. While significant advances have been made in understanding which PU.1 locus chromatin states are active or silent, nothing is known how these states are propagated and maintained. In this study I aim to investigate mechanisms of noncoding RNA involvement in formation of alterant chromatin states and shed light on the interplay between well established epigenetic marks (such as nucleosome positioning, histone modification, and DNA methylation) and the emerging class of new epigenetic marks: noncoding RNAs. Therefore I will investigate the functional effect of noncoding RNAs ablation on the formation of the active chromatin configuration and the expression of the PU.1 gene and, ultimately, on hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) fate. Accomplishment of these aims will enable us to understand the roles of noncoding RNAs corresponding to the PU.1 gene locus in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and to identify naturally occurring RNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms, the manipulation of which might lead to critical changes in cell fate and provide knowledge of how changes in noncoding RNAs can lead to disorders of hematopoietic stem cell function and leukemia.

The polycomb complex, bmiPRC1, has been shown to mono-ubiquitylate histone H2A lysine 119, playing a key role in epigenetic gene regulation. Mammalian cells have a number of Bmi1 paralogues, including Mel-18, all of which form a unique PRC1-like complex. I have recently identified a novel PRC1-like complex melPRC1. Phosphorylation of Mel-18 within the melPRC1 complex is required for the correct spatial positioning of the ubiquitin ligase machinery to specifically ubiquitylate H2A lysine 119. The key objectives of this proposal are to identify regulators of Mel-18 phosphorylation and determine how phosphorylation imparts specificity of the E3 ligase activity. The requirement of phosphorylation of Mel-18 for nucleosome recognition and the correct spatial positioning of the E3 ubiquitin machinery will be examined using recombinant components in vitro. Key regulators involved in Mel-18 phosphorylation will be identified through biochemical approaches. The function of these key regulato rs in the dynamics of Mel-18 phosphorylation will be investigated in different cellular contexts. In addition, I propose to identify and characterise novel PRC1-like complexes. This proposal will provide novel insight into the link between cellular signalling pathways and melPRC1 complexes, which results in transcriptional repression via specific histone modification.

This structural highly dynamic polymeric molecule is composed of DNA and mainly histone proteins. Chromatin can be further divided into transcriptional active euchromatin or transcriptional inert heterochromatin. Post-translational modifications (PTM) of histones appear as key regulators of chromatin function thereby epitomizing the biochemical basis for epigenetic phenomena. One way how PTMs impact chromatin biology is via the recruitment of modification dependent effector proteins which further relay the modification to a particular biologic effect. Methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9) is considered one of the hallmarks of heterochromatin. One novel factor that was demonstrated recently to recognize this modification via a chromodomain is CDYL, indicating a possible function in organization of heterochromatin. This factor was shown to possess transcriptional repressor activity, probably via transient interaction with a repressor complex; however the function of CDYL in chromatin biology is not yet characterized. In this project I will analyze the role of CDYL in chromatin biology via biochemical, biophysical and cell biology approaches. To this end I will determine the subcellular localization of CDYL via fluorescence-microscopy and the chromatin related localization via genome wide mapping approaches. I will accurately analyze thermodynamic parameters of CDYL binding to chromatin and effects of this association on chromatin structure in vivo and in vitro. Further I will investigate consequences of CDYL binding on transcriptional regulation in vivo. To get a comprehensive understanding of CDYL direct and indirect functions in chromatin organization I will identify and characterize CDYL associated proteins as well as RNAs. The impact of these factors on CDYL chromatin-functions will be addressed via biochemical and biophysical methods. I expect the dataset generated from the suggested experiments to significantly expand our knowledge how CDYL may participate in heterochromatin formation.

Two key mechanisms known to regulate the functional state of chromatin in mammals are the methylation of DNA and the post-translational modification of histone proteins. Due to the large number of possible modifications, epigenetic information can be stored in chromatin modification patterns. Chromatin modifications have been shown to regulate all DNA-associated processes, such as transcription, replication, and DNA repair, and play an important role in cell proliferation and differentiation. These functions are intimately linked to the faithful interpretation and inheritance of genetic information and the memory of a cell’s identity. Deregulation of these modifications and their modifying enzymes are implicated in many types of diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders. Many chromatin-regulating factors have been identified that recognise methylated DNA or modified histones. Such effector molecules use a range of different binding domains in order to establish and orchestrate biological events. Since chromatin is a large macromolecular assembly, modifications most likely act in a concerted manner. However, it is still unclear how the information contained in combinatorial modification patterns on the DNA and histones is interpreted. Our aim is to understand how combinations of DNA and histone modifications regulate the activity of chromatin. We employ the tools of chemical biology, biochemistry and proteomics in conjunction with tissue culture and genomic technologies in order to study proteins that can recognise DNA and histone modification patterns in the context of chromatin. We have developed a technique called SILAC nucleosome affinity purification that allows us to identify proteins that bind DNA or histone modifications on in vitro assembled nucleosomes using high-resolution mass spectrometry. We will use this technique for identifying new factors that integrate information contained in multiple chromatin modifications on nucleosomes and chromatin, and for understanding how they operate at the molecular level. We are particularly interested in the molecular mechanisms that underlie epigenetic gene regulation events during DNA replication, tumour formation and differentiation processes. Our research will help elucidate how chromatin modifications regulate cellular processes and how deregulation of normal chromatin function leads to diseases. Our ultimate goal is to identify the critical factors and to understand their molecular and cellular functions in order to develop drugs for epigenetic therapies against diseases such as cancer.

39	Dr Till Bartke	Imperial College London	None	2013-05-01	2018-05-01	Regulation of Chromatin by Combinatorial DNA and Histone Modifications	The normal expression of genes is tightly regulated. Modifications on histones or on DNA play a central role in the control of gene expression and errors in their regulation often result in diseases such as cancer. These modifications can recruit proteins that regulate chromatin function. Since chromatin is a large macromolecular assembly, modifications most likely act in a concerted manner. However, it is still unclear how the information encoded in combinatorial modification patterns on the DNA and histones is translated into biological signals. My aim is to understand how combinations of DNA and histone modifications regulate the activity of chromatin. I will employ the tools of chemical biology, biochemistry and proteomics in conjunction with tissue culture models in order to identify proteins that can recognise DNA and histone modification patterns in the context of chromatin. I propose to use native chemical ligations to generate a library of histone proteins that carry combinations of modifications that are known to mark specific genomic loci. These histones will be assembled into chromatin together with methylated DNA in order to mimic functional genetic elements such as heterochromatin, promoters or enhancers. I will use the recombinantly defined chromatin in chromatin modification, chromatin remodelling and SILAC affinity purification assays in order to identify novel factors that recognise combinatorial modifications. The SILAC affinity purifications will be linked to a primary cell cancer model in order to identify factors that regulate central tumour suppressor genes. The identified factors will be further characterised in vivo, in vitro and in structural studies in order to understand their molecular function. These experiments will identify factors that can read epigenetic signatures contained in chromatin modification patterns. These constitute the primary targets for ?epigenetic drugs? that intervene at key stages in the development of cancer.	European Research Council	Starting Grant	1629630.0	EUR
40	Dr Manel Esteller Badosa	Fundació Privada Institut D'investigació Biomèdica De Bellvitge	None	2011-04-01	2016-04-01	Epigenetic Disruption of Non-Coding RNAs in Human Cancer	In recent years, my laboratory, as well as others, have established the observation that epigenetic disruption, particularly in the DNA methylation and histone modification patterns, contributes to the initiation and progression of human tumors (Esteller, Nat Rev Genet 2007; Esteller, N Engl J Med 2008; Esteller, Nat Rev Biotech, In Press, 2010). Even more recently, it has been recognized that microRNAs, small non-coding RNAs that are thought to regulate gene expression by sequence-specific base pairing in mRNA targets, also play a key role in the biology of the cell, and that they can also have an impact in the development of many diseases, including cancer (le Sage and Agami, 2006; Blenkiron and Miska, 2007). However, there is little understanding about epigenetic modifications that might regulate the activity of microRNAs and other non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs), transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs), small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), long interspersed ncRNAs (lincRNAs), promoter-associated RNAs (PASRs and PALRs) and terminator-associated sRNAs (TASRs) (Calin et al., 2007; Mercer, et al., 2009; Ghildiyal & Zamore, 2009; Jacquier, 2009). Our ignorance in this respect is even more significant if we consider these questions in the domain of cancer. Making best use of our expertise in several of these fields, my group will tackle the study of the epigenetic modifications that regulate ncRNA expression and how the DNA methylation and histone modifications profiles of these loci might become distorted in human cancer. These findings could have profound consequences not only in the understading of tumor biology, but in the design of better molecular staging, diagnosis and treatments of human malignancies.

Perturbations in such modifications can contribute to neoplastic processes. We will focus on a specific chromatin modification: histone H2B monoubiquitylation. The significance of monoubiquitylated H2B (H2Bub) will be studied by manipulating RNF20, the major E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for H2B ubiquitylation as part of a heteromeric complex with RNF40. In one major line of research, we will assess the biochemistry of RNF20/H2Bub. The effects of RNF20/H2B on gene expression will be explored through identification of proteins that interact with H2Bub and through in vitro incorporation of H2Bub into nucleosomes. Effects of H2Bub on transcription elongation will be studied by a new high resolution ChIP-seq method (NET-seq). Based on recent ChIP-seq data, we will also explore links between H2B and regulation of splicing. Furthermore, we will investigate the regulatory crosstalk between H2Bub and microRNAs. The other major line of research will explore the biology of RNF20/H2Bub, with particular emphasis on cancer-related processes. This will be addressed through a combination of cell culture models and mouse models, including constitutive and conditional RNF20 knockout mice. The contribution of RNF20/H2Bub to various differentiation programs, with particular emphasis on embryonic stem cell differentiation, will also be investigated. In addition, we will study the impact of RNF20/H2Bub on NF-kB activity and on inflammatory responses; this will combine in vitro and in vivo systems, with emphasis on inflammation-related cancer. Finally, we will monitor changes in RNF20, RNF40 and H2Bub status in human tumors and investigate underlying mechanisms.	European Research Council	Advanced Grant	2500000.0	EUR

V(D)J recombination, the process by which multiple gene segments are recombined together to generate a diverse antigen receptor repertoire, is tightly regulated by differential chromatin opening. How this is achieved in these large multigene loci is poorly understood. We have discovered that antisense intergenic transcription occurs throughout the immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) locus in regions poised for V(D)J recombination. We have proposed that this transcription remodels chromatin for VH-to-DJH recombination. The aim of this project is to test this hypothesis by asking: What is the function of antisense intergenic transcription in V(D)J recombination? Our objectives are: (1) To interrupt antisense intergenic transcription in the mouse Igh DJ region in vivo to determine whether it is required for Igh D to J recombination. (2) To analyse the effects of inhibiting transcription on events preceding D to J recombination, to determine how antisense transcription achieves its effects on D to J recombination. (3) To remove antisense transcripts produced prior to D to J recombination, in vitro, to determine the role of these transcript products in D to J recombination separately from the process of transcription. We will achieve these objectives firstly by 'knocking-in' transcription termination cassettes into the DJ region , downstream of two major antisense transcription start sites we have identified. We will determine the effects of transcription loss on D to J recombination using RNA-FISH analysis of primary transcripts in single cells, and DNA-FISH and PCR-based V(D)J recombination assays. If loss of transcription inhibits D to J recombination, we will analyse associated processes including nuclear relocation and histone modification, by DNA-immunoFISH and CHIP, respectively, to determine how antisense transcription exerts its effects. Similar strategies will be used to determine the effects of in vitro loss of antisense transcripts.	Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council	Standard grant	423496.0	GBP

Significance: Cancer is one of the leading causes of death among children in the developed world. Advances in treatment have raised survival rates to 80% for many paediatric cancers, but certain rare tumours including Ewing sarcoma continue to be associated with poor survival. The discovery of epigenetic aberrations in paediatric cancers (such as changes in DNA methylation and histone modification patterns) suggests a promising route toward new therapies. Epigenetic aberrations can be reversed by an emerging class of epigenetic drugs, which are already used for cancer treatment in the elderly. The prospect that epigenetic events may broadly contribute to the development of paediatric tumours opens up exciting opportunities for epigenetic cancer therapy in children. Goal: The project will study epigenetic aberrations with relevance to Ewing sarcoma, a rare paediatric tumour of the bone that lacks satisfactory treatment strategies. Ewing sarcoma is driven by the oncogenic fusion protein EWS/FLI1, thus providing a powerful model for dissecting the interplay of fusion proteins and epigenetic regulation on a genome-wide scale. Innovation: An in vivo mouse transplantation assay will be used to investigate the regulatory networks coordinated by EWS/FLI1. This approach provides a major advance over prior research, which has been restricted to in vitro cancer cell lines. The in vivo assay will provide insights into the chain of regulatory events that lead to carcinogenesis, and it will establish an assay for pre-clinical testing of epigenetic drugs. Approach: Aim 1. Development of a flexible and tractable assay for EWS/FLI1-induced transformation Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are considered the tissue of origin of Ewing sarcoma. An in vivo transplantation assay will be established based on EWS/FLI1-expressing MSCs, which induces transformation and carcinogenesis. This model will be complemented by in vitro assays using both mouse and human MSCs. Aim 2. Identification of epigenetic states and events associated with EWS/FLI1-induced transformation Epigenome mapping of EWS/FLI1-induced tumours will be combined with gene expression and EWS/FLI-binding analysis. Integrated bioinformatic analysis of the resulting dataset will identify candidate epigenetic events relevant for carcinogenesis. Aim 3. Functional characterisation of epigenetic events contributing to EWS/FLI1-induced transformation Potentially causal epigenetic events will be functionally characterized by knock-down and over-expression of epigenetic regulators in vitro. The clinical relevance of these events will be confirmed by epigenetic analysis of human tumour samples and by epigenetic drug treatment of the in vivo mouse model. Alignment with Funding Strategy: The proposed project addresses all three aims of the Lise Meitner program: (i). it enables a scientist trained in world-class labs to pursue a research project at one of Austria’s leading cancer research institutes, while exploiting local expertise in genomic and mouse research through collaborations; (ii). it introduces a new scientific field to Austria; and (iii). it establishes a formal collaboration between an Austrian institute and a leading research institute abroad.

Weaver syndrome has been recently associated with the genetic defect in a protein, called EZH2, that chemically modifies one of the proteins around which DNA is wrapped within our cells. This protein is called Histone H3, and its modification by EZH2 is important in controlling how genes are expressed during development. However, while much is known about the function of EZH2 in orchestrating development, there is no understanding of how the genetic defect found in Weaver syndrome patients brings about the cardinal manifestations associated to the disease. In particular the role of EZH2 in the function of mature neurons, ie. once the cerebral cortex has completed its development, remains unclear. The aim of our project is to define how the genetic defect of Weaver syndrome causes malfunction or abnormal development of cortical neurons, in order to shed light on the mechanisms responsible for cognitive impairment in Weaver syndrome patients. To this end we use a very innovative technological approach to fill the gap between what is known on the function of EZH2 and the clinical manifestations of this disease. Specifically, we use fibroblasts from small skin biopsies, provided by Weaver syndrome patients, and we reprogram them into pluripotent stem cells which can then be differentiated, in vitro, into cortical neurons. We will perform on these patient-specific cells a wide range of advanced molecular analyses to define what are the key genes whose function is altered as a result of the genetic defects in EZH2. Furthermore, the characterization of pluripotent stem cells from Weaver patients will become an important tool for the Weaver syndrome research community, since these cells can be used to study the effect of Weaver mutations on the full range of cell types involved in the clinical manifestations of the disease.

However, even a small amount of remaining undifferentiated ES cells in these cultures would be a problem for transplantation because ES cells are tumorigenic. This proposal aims to understand the molecular mechanisms and importance of epigenetic modifications in ES cell self-renewal and in the initial steps of ES cell-mesoderm differentiation. Knowledge gained will then be applied to achieve tight regulation of transition between pluripotent cells and the mesoderm lineage in culture. For this purpose, Mbd3 deficient ES cells will be used. Mbd3 is a component of the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase (NuRD) complex and Mbd3 deficient ES cells have severe differentiation defects. In the absence of LIF Mbd3 deficient ES cells begin to express Fgf5, an early ectoderm marker, but maintain expression of the stem cell marker Oct4, without inducing the early mesoendoderm marker, Brachyury. Fgf5 expression can be reversed by culturing in the presence of LIF, therefore although Mbd3 deficient ES cells appear to initiate to differentiation they cannot progress beyond the point from where cells cannot return to undifferentiated ES cells. Interestingly Mbd3 deficient ES cells expressing an Mbd3ER fusion protein, which can be either nuclear or cytoplasmic depending upon the addition of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (4OHT), can successfully differentiate and begin to express Brachyury in a 4OHT-dependent manner. I will use this system to dissect the gene expression events that occur during these early differentiation steps. To further dissect the initial events of ES cell differentiation I will use a Nanog-reporter gene construct to isolate ES cells expressing low levels of Nanog, which have recently been shown to be poised to differentiate. Gene expression patterns of Nanog-low expressing cells in wild-type and Mbd3 deficient ES cells will be compared in order to provide molecular snapshots of gene expression patterns immediately prior to, and immediately following the initiation of differentiation. From these experiments and subsequent functional analyses, I will be able to identify genes playing important roles in the early stages of ES cell differentiation, particularly towards the mesendoderm lineages. The results of this study will be used to identify conditions under which tight control of ES cell differentiation towards the mesoendoderm lineage can be achieved.

PcG and trxG proteins form multimeric complexes that are required to maintain their expression state after the initial transcriptional regulators disappear from the embryo. Subsequent work led to a better understanding of their mechanisms of action. Moreover, PcG and trxG genes have also been identified in vertebrates, where they regulate Hox genes, they are involved in cell proliferation, stem cell identity and cancer, genomic imprinting in plants and mammals and X inactivation.PcG and trxG components form multimeric complexes. Some trxG and PcG components possess methyltransferase activities directed toward specific lysines of histone H3, whereas other trxG and PcG proteins interpret these histone marks. Recent studies have described the genomewide distribution of PcG proteins and of their related histone modification in Drosophila and other species. However, the ?PcG recruitment code? to their target chromatin is still not understood, and the mechanism of PcG-mediated gene silencing is unclear. The formation of subnuclear silencing compartments might contribute to the stable repression of transcription. Drosophila PcG proteins have a speckled nuclear distribution and the number of these so-called ?PcG bodies? is progressively reduced during development. We showed that multiple PREs can associate in the nucleus to enhance the strength of PcG-mediated silencing. However, we do not know how frequent is this clustering process and how important it is functionally at a genomewide level. Our project will tackle these questions by using a combination of genetics, developmental biology, cell biology, genomics and bioinformatic approaches, with the aim to gain an integrated understanding of the role of Polycomb and trithorax in biology	European Research Council	Advanced Grant	2200000.0	EUR
47	Dr Tom Milne	University of Oxford	None	2012-04-01	2017-03-31	The Epigenetic Control of Gene Expression in Leukaemia and Haematopoiesis	The Mixed Lineage Leukaemia 1 protein (MLL1) protein is important for the epigenetic regulation of gene expression during stem and progenitor cell development but is also mutated in a subset of aggressive human leukaemias. The most common leukaemic disruptions of the MLL1 gene are chromosome translocations that fuse the N terminus of MLL1 in frame with over 40 different partner genes creating novel fusion proteins. Recent work has suggested that wild type MLL1 and MLL1 fusion proteins cooperate in leukaemogenesis by together causing aberrant epigenetic profiles at target genes in vivo. Epigenetic changes are often defined as heritable changes in gene expression or chromosome stability that don’t alter the underlying DNA sequence. We are interested in identifying the key molecular events in MLL1 mediated leukaemogenesis in order to fully understand the epigenetic basis for this disease. This major goal has been divided into three key questions: 1) What key downstream gene targets are essential for MLL1 mediated leukaemogenesis?; 2) how do MLL1 and MLL1 fusion proteins control epigenetic gene regulation on a molecular level?; and 3) how are MLL1 and MLL1 fusion proteins recruited to important gene targets in the cell? To answer these questions, we are using xenograft transplant assays to identify Leukaemic Stem Cells (LSCs) in MLL1 patient samples, ChIP-seq to identify and characterise direct gene targets in specific haematopoietic cell populations, small molecular inhibitors and siRNA combined with ChIP and ChIP-seq to determine how MLL1 fusion proteins regulate gene targets in the cell and MLL1 domain analysis coupled with genome wide techniques to determine how MLL1 is recruited to gene targets in the cell. Answering these questions may not only be useful for future therapeutic strategies, but will also inform our basic understanding of epigenetic gene regulation during normal stem and progenitor cell development.

Asthma is one of the commonest chronic diseases to affect people in more developed countries. It is an important cause of illness in children as well as adults and can lead to absence from school and work, frequent hospital visits and continues to cause a significant number of deaths. The annual cost to the NHS of providing care for people with asthma has been estimated to be around £1 billion. Although many people with asthma are treated effectively, a sizeable proportion of people struggle with poorly controlled asthma, which greatly affects their quality of life and leads to substantial use of NHS resources. New effective ways of treating asthma are needed. Studies in the laboratory that we and others have carried out using cells grown from the airways of people with asthma have shown that drugs that stimulate a certain receptor (called peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma or PPAR-gamma) have anti-inflammatory effects and could, therefore, be useful in the treatment of asthma. The proposed project will determine whether the effects seen in the laboratory can also be seen in people with asthma. This will involve us carrying out a small clinical trial in which 100 people with asthma are given either pioglitazone (a drug that stimulates the PPAR-gamma receptor) or a placebo (dummy treatment that looks like the pioglitazone treatment but doesn't contain active drug) for 12 weeks. We will then measure markers of asthma control (for example lung function) and effects on markers of inflammation in sputum samples in the group of patients who were given pioglitazone and the group who were given the dummy treatment and compare these measures between the groups using statistical tests. This will help us to determine whether drugs that stimulate these receptors could become a completely new approach for the treatment of asthma. The project will be carried out by a team of researchers with a strong track record of successfully designing and completing clinical studies in patients with asthma and other respiratory diseases. It will be conducted in state of the art research facilities at the University of Nottingham and will benefit from the recent award of a Biomedical Research Unit in Respiratory diseases, a £6.1 million investment by the National Institute for Health Research. Specifically, the project willl be supported by a dedicated research nurse and doctor, other members of the clinical trials research team and will also benefit from established clinical trials resources and state of the art research facilities. The availability of these resources has helped us to keep the cost of the proposed project below £100,000.	National Institute for Health Research (Department of Health)	Full Grant	123998.0	GBP

50	Dr Grant Stewart	University of Birmingham	Cancer Sciences	2015-01-01	2017-12-31	Defining a fundamental role for histone methylation in preventing DNA damage-induced replication catastrophe	'Replication stress' is a term that encompasses any type of abnormality that obstructs replication, the common result of which is increased genome instability. In addition to the well-established link between genomic instability and tumour development, it is becoming increasingly evident that replication stress is also an important pathological process underlying the development of human disease. It is thought that failed replication caused by unrepaired DNA damage leads to increased cell death, particularly in highly proliferative tissues. This is exemplified by the human syndrome Fanconi Anaemia (FA), which is characterised by developmental defects, progressive bone marrow failure, tumour predisposition and a hypersensitivity to agents that induce replication stress e.g. Mitomycin C (MMC). The study of human disorders such as FA and the cellular pathways affected in these patients has significantly furthered our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that have evolved to protect against the deleterious effects of replication stress. Here we have identified PFAP (Putative Fanconi Anaemia Protein), a member of a histone methyltransferase complex, as a novel suppressor of replication stress. Cells lacking PFAP exhibit a strikingly similar phenotype to that associated with defects in the FA DNA repair pathway, such as a hypersensitivity to MMC, damage-induced replication abnormalities and chromosomal breakage following exposure to MMC. Taken together, these data suggest that PFAP functions to coordinate the repair of replication-associated DNA damage in conjunction with the FA pathway. Our finding that PFAP depleted cells also have reduced levels of histone methylation provides the first evidence of a mechanistic link between epigenetic histone modification and the maintenance of genome stability. Our proposal focuses on understanding how PFAP promotes the repair of damaged replication forks and whether this is mediated through histone methylation.

To unveil the mechanisms by which programs of gene expression are established during differentiation represents a key challenge towards the development of stem cell therapies and differentiation protocols into specific cellular lineages. Recent work has shown that important cohorts of developmental regulator genes are silent in ESCs but primed for activation upon differentiation. We and others have shown that the poised state reflects an equilibrium between Polycomb silencing by histone modification and the presence of poised RNAPII complexes, which elongate through coding regions, but lack Ser2 phosphorylation which uncouples transcription from downstream RNA processing events such as RNA splicing and polyadenylation. Poised RNAPII have not yet been identified in lineage-committed cells, but are likely to occurs since Polycomb silencing is essential during development. The molecular mechanisms that regulate the poised state of RNAPII at developmental regulator genes in ESCs are still unknown. The aims of this proposal are to: 1) investigate dynamic changes in RNAPII phosphorylation during neuronal commitment of ESCs in neural stem cells and post-mitotic neurons, and 2) to address the mechanisms of RNAPII poising regulated by the modulators of RNAPII activity in ESC pluripotency, using a combination of ChIP, siRNA, and transcriptome analyses. The Systems Approach proposed to integrate epigenetic and expression data obtained here during neuronal commitment and upon interference with the regulatory networks that control RNAPII activity in ESCs will provide important insights about the chromatin priming mechanisms that are active in ESCs. The accomplishment of these objectives will clarify important transcriptional mechanisms of outstanding interest in the biology of pluripotent cells and in the basic mechanisms of gene regulation.

Our hypothesis is that chromatin dynamics, especially changes of histone variant H2AZ occupancy over CpG islands, regulate innate immunity gene expression in intestinal epithelium cells. We propose that histone H2AZ occupancy relates to cellular stress and the innate immunity response, e.g., during exposure to microbes, may reflect such a stress. To test this, we will exploit a very well established colitis model in the mouse, Dextran Sodium Sulfate (DSS) mediated colitis, and focus on the role of two chromatin remodeling factors that promote (EP400) and counteract (Smarcad1) histone H2AZ occupancy. We will examine an exciting new histone modification, crotonylation, which we find is affected by chromatin remodeling and may be linked to H2AZ occupancy and possible the microbiota. We will use chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to high-throughput sequencing (ChIPseq) approaches to map histone H2AZ, histone crotonylation and chromatin remodeling factor occupancy during normal and colitis conditions and link these occupancies to a detailed analysis of the transcriptome, including the noncoding transcriptome. We will systematically examine CpG island chromatin using mass spectrometry approaches under all these conditions. Our work will test if chromatin remodeling factors are involved in coordinating an innate immunity response. Together, data generated in this proposal will paint a detailed picture how the transcriptome in colon epithelial cells is affected during colitis and how chromatin dynamics prime these cells to respond to an insult.

The project will test the hypothesis that epigenetic pronuclear patterns and parental assymmetries are actively maintained in the zygote and that a sequence of changes in histone methylation levels is required for the onset of gene activation. The experiments will employ in vitro culture of mouse zygotes to assess the effects of histone methyltransferase and demethylase inhibitors on preimplantation development, downstream epigenetic markers and early gene expression timing. The goal is to obtain more information on the mechanism through the use of small molecule inhibitors of key steps in the reprogramming process. The study aims to progress understanding of zygotic programming mechanisms that are essential for early development. The results will be relevant to human embryology and assisted reproduction, and will contribute insights applicable to somatic cell reprogramming for regenerative medicine.

Their role consists in translating the pathogen-derived information to prime an appropriate T cell mediated immune response. Together with cells of the innate immune system, DCs induce the development of different types of CD4+ T helper cell subsets, including Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17 and regulatory T cells (Tregs) to clear a specific pathogen and/or avoid immunopathology. Little is known about how DCs interpret and integrate multiple pathogen signals to which they are exposed to ensure appropriate education of the responding T cells. This paucity in understanding fundamental aspects of DC biology is in part due to the unavailability of a DC line that can faithfully mimic the ex vivo DC responses. Here, we will have the advantage of using DC cell lines that have recently been established and extensively characterized by Hans Acha-Orbea’s group at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland. These cell lines share remarkable similarities with ex vivo derived DCs, in terms of cross-presentation of antigen, response to maturation stimuli, cytokine & chemokine secretion, and induction of costimulatory molecules.Differential gene expression is controlled by site-specific DNA binding transcription factors (TFs). One superfamily of TFs, the nuclear receptors (NRs) consists of ligand-dependent TFs and they control their target genes by switching from co-repressor to co-activator binding in a ligand dependent manner. Recent reports suggest that treatment of DCs with high affinity NR ligands such as rosiglitazone and vitamin-D for PPAR? and Vitamin-D receptor (VDR) respectively modulate their activation and maturation signals resulting in altered immune responses. This strongly indicates an important role of nuclear receptor co-repressors in controlling the function of DCs. The co-repressors NCoR1 and SMRT were originally identified as interaction partners of unliganded NRs but recent studies revealed that they also interact with non-NR TFs such as NFkB, RBPjk, and AP1 that also play a crucial role in controlling DC immune responses. It has been assumed that these co-repressors control gene transcription by recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs). Contrary to this, we found in pre-adipocytes that co-repressors bind predominantly at open chromatin/enhancers marked by H3K27ac/H3K4me1 suggestive that they in fact co-localize with co-activators (p300). Recent studies reporting NCoR1 and SMRT DNA binding profiling in macrophages revealed that they directly regulate genes, accountable for antigen recognition, costimulation and T cell speciation in DCs. However, until now there has been no systematic study elucidating the role of these co-repressors on DC activation, maturation, and its impact on T cell priming. The overarching aim of this study therefore is to characterize the involvement of these co-repressors in enabling DCs to modulate the repertoire of T cell differentiation in vitro and in vivo in response to different antigenic stimuli. Specifically, we propose to determine the genome-wide DNA targets of these co-repressors, their protein interaction partners, and how and to which extent they influence gene expression or repression, collectively aiming to acquire a comprehensive picture of the co-repressor-controlled regulatory networks mediating DC immune responses.This immuno-genomics approach will help us to better understand how antigen signals are integrated in DCs, which in turn may be of great value to generate approaches aimed at manipulating the immunogenic and tolerogenic properties of DCs to stimulate or attenuate T cell specific immune responses. The potential findings of this research project have important implications in vaccinology, autoimmunity, cancer, and treatment of chronic infections.The following objectives are proposed:(i)Characterize the role of the co-repressors NCoR1 and SMRT in DC immune response generation under different antigen stimulation conditions (microbial CpG, viral Poly-IC, host derived factor IFN? and combined stimulation with all three antigens) using stable NCoR1/SMRT gene knockdown (KD) CD8a+ DCs. An integrative immuno-genomics approach will be used for this purpose. Thereafter, we plan to evaluate the impact of these altered responses on T helper cell differentiation into various subtypes. (ii)Validate the effect of these co-repressors in vivo on DC function and on skewing of the effecter T helper cell lineage using DC-specific conditional knockout mice for NCoR1 and SMRT. (iii)Perform population and single cell transcriptomics of in situ isolated CD8a+ DCs and CD69+ activated T helper cells isolated from the spleen of co-repressor KO and wild type animals immunized with antigens. (iv)Determine the genome-wide DNA-binding profiles of NCoR1, SMRT as well as H3K27ac histone modification enrichment in DCs stimulated with CpG, polyIC, IFN? and combined stimulation with all three antigens to identify the genome-wide targets of these co-repressors and binding dynamics. (v)Integrate computationally, the ChIP-seq and RNA-seq datasets to identify the direct/indirect target genes controlled by these co-repressors. De novo motif search within co-repressor bound DNA regions may thereby reveal the identity of TFs that mediate DNA recruitment of the co-repressors to DNA. We will further classify the direct target genes of these co-repressors into different functional groups (Cistrome) according to different TF-corepressor interactions and annotate the functional relevance of these cistromes.(vi)Construct co-repressor-mediated gene regulatory networks controlling DC activation and maturation and thereby T helper cell speciation, aiming to elucidate the gene regulatory mechanisms underlying DC immune responses when exposed to specific antigens and to develop novel strategies to modulate DC function and thereby T cell differentiation.(vii)Experimental validation of computationally predicted TF-corepressor interactions by perturbing selected TFs or TF-corepressor interactions to characterize their impact on DC functions.

Yet, epigenome integrity is challenged during all DNA transactions, including DNA damage repair. While much effort has been devoted to characterizing chromatin alterations in response to DNA damage and how they contribute to the repair response, our knowledge of this fundamental process is largely incomplete, and whether and how epigenetic features are re-established following a genotoxic stress challenge is still unexplored. Thus, a comprehensive framework of the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of epigenome integrity in response to DNA damage is lacking. The present project aims to fill this important gap by profiling the epigenome of repair patches following UVC damage in human cells and by characterizing the molecular players contributing to chromatin restoration/plasticity. I propose an integrated approach that tackles this question at different levels of chromatin organization, from histone and DNA modifications up to higher-order chromatin folding. Building on our unique expertise and through the development of powerful novel methodologies, combining cutting-edge imaging, proteomics and epigenomic technologies, we will elucidate mechanisms for (1) histone modification re-establishment and maintenance and (2) DNA methylation inheritance at repair sites. We will also investigate how repair-associated changes in DNA and histone modifications reflect at the level of (3) higher-order chromatin organization in the tridimensional nuclear space, and dissect (4) functional crosstalks between the epigenetic changes that arise in damaged chromatin. This ambitious research project represents an unprecedented effort towards a comprehensive and integrated understanding of epigenome maintenance mechanisms in response to genotoxic stress.

Although this is common knowledge, underlying molecular processes remain unclear. Recent findings suggest telomere-associated proteins bind DNA outside telomeres genome-wide. Therefore, whether and how telomeres might influence extra-telomeric binding and function of such proteins is interesting. Our new data show that a telomeric protein regulates distantly located genes in a telomere-sensitive fashion. With this and other supporting evidence, here we investigate telomere-dependent global gene control in ways not explored before. Findings are likely to reveal molecular mechanisms linking telomeres functionally to the extra-telomeric genome.	DBT/Wellcome Trust India Alliance	Senior Fellowship Renewal	4.0346E+7	INR

Histone sequence variants are common in eukaryotic lineages and they generate diversity in chromatin structure to influence cellular specification and epigenetic inheritance. During spermatogenesis, animals and plants undergo a dramatic structural organization of the genome that serves to tightly package and protect paternal chromatin in preparation for its delivery to the female gametes. Studies in mice have shown that testis-specific histone variants mark specific loci to facilitate genome reorganization and poise genes for expression during embryogenesis. In plants, we have known of sperm specific-histone variants for nearly 20 years yet we still know little about their role in reprogramming the paternal genome. Arabidopsis sperm cells are characterized by the expression of two specific histone variants, HTB8 and HTR10, which encode histones H2B.8 and H3.10, respectively. Recent detailed marker analysis has shown that H2B.8 and H3.10 also accumulate in condensed chromatin of embryonic nuclei during late embryogenesis, suggesting a potential role in chromatin compaction. As such H2B.8 and H3.10 represent a fitting case study to explore the epigenetic role of histone variants in plant gametogenesis and late embryogenesis, providing insight into how chromatin architecture relates to differentiation. This proposal describes a 24-month project designed to characterize H2B.8 and H3.10 function by comparing both pollen and seed chromatin in Arabidopsis thaliana. In addition, pollen ontology will be used as a cellular system to profile spatial and temporal changes in chromatin organisation during development. To achieve the objectives of this proposal, the research methodology is designed to carry out five main objectives (1) to generate genome-wide maps of H2B.8 and H3.10 deposition by ChIP-seq analysis using both native and GFP antibodies (2) to use advance microscopy and profile gene expression in knockout mutants to determine the impact of H2B.8 and H3.10 on gene expression and chromatin condensation (3) to map the post-translational modifications H2B.8 and H3.10 accumulate in planta using mass-spectrometry (4) to compare the histone complement and global modification state of progenitor germ cell, sperm cell and vegetative cell chromatin using quantitative mass spectrometry (5) to identify H2B.8 and H3.10 orthologues in different angiosperm families and to demonstrate conserved male gamete-specificity using in situ hybridisation. The project is proposed to take place in Dr Frederic Berger’s lab at the Gregor Mendel Institute in Vienna.	Austrian Science Fund FWF	Lise Meitner Programme	157380.0	EUR

Gene expression is regulated at multiple levels, with transcription having received most attention. However, additional layers of regulation, including RNA turnover and translation, may rival the sophistication and importance of transcriptional control. Mistakes at any regulatory step can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation, contributing to the complexity of cancer. Integration of data covering different aspects of gene expression related to the cell cycle, acquired under controlled conditions in a model organism, will help to fully understand gene expression programs, including the complex re-programming accompanying carcinogenesis. We pursue an integrated functional-genomic approach to analyse gene expression control throughout the fission yeast cell cycle. We plan: 1) functional studies of cell cycle-regulated transcription, addressing the roles, binding sites, and complex formation of transcription factors; 2) genome-wide mapping of histone-modification patterns; 3) global analyses of posttranscriptional regulation, measuring RNA decay and translational control, and identifying targets of RNA-binding proteins; 4) cell-cycle interference using genetic and external perturbations to reveal the plasticity of regulatory mechanisms; and 5) integration of data sets from several regulatory levels (chromatin to translation) to acquire a system-wide understanding of coordinated strategies for gene expression and cell-cycle control.

We will use a mouse model, where offspring prenatally exposed to a high fat nutritional environment develop the metabolic syndrome phenotype in adulthood following post-weaning high- fat feeding. We are suggesting that a maternal diet during pregnancy that is high in fat can adversely affect the development of the offspring's circadian clock system in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and in peripheral tissues, resulting in altered rhythmic expression and function of clock and clock-controlled genes involved in the regulation of adipogenesis, metabolism and cardiovascular function. If these offspring are subsequently fed the same high fat diet, their physiology will be unable to respond appropriately making them particularly susceptible to developing metabolic To address our aim we will look at circadian metabolic, hormonal and activity patterns in mouse offspring from high fat fed dams and examine the effects of a post-weaning high fat feeding. We will then measure the 24h mRNA expression pattern of clock and clock-controlled genes, and other 'candidate' genes linked to both circadian and metabolic/cardiovascular/adipocyte function in neonate and adult offspring SCN and peripheral tissues which are key organelles to the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome. We will also examine whether an epigenetic mechanism, i.e. modification of rhythmic histone acetylation of clock- associated genes and RNA polymerase binding, is involved in the aberration and phase-shift in the circadian timing system and maladapted responses to a post-weaning high fat diet. Our proposed study will provide the scientific basis for understanding how an unhealthy diet in early life contributes to metabolic syndrome later in life. Results from this study will have direct relevance to humans.	Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council	Standard grant	297008.0	GBP

LaeA presumably acts through histone modification, but several aspects of its molecular action are so far not understood. This includes an automethylation function and a plethora of interacting partners. Aspergillus LaeA forms a complex with Velvet domain proteins as VeA/VEL1. The Trichoderma counterparts LAE1 and VEL1 exhibit additional cellular functions by controlling mycoparasitism and the formation of cellulases through the regulator XYR1. This supports that the phylogenetically conserved Aspergillus LaeA and its counterpart Trichoderma LAE1 exhibit distinct differences in their target genes. The proposed project focuses (i) on a comprehensive identification and comparison of the interacting partners of both orthologues. A special focus will be (ii) on the relationship between the LAE1/VEL1 Velvet complex and the XYR1 transcription factor for cellulase genes, (iii) the role of LaeA/Lae1 automethylation and (iv) the molecular interaction between LaeA/LAE1 and acetyltransferases. The aim of the project is to generate important insights in the molecular mechanism of LaeA and LAE1 to improve recombinant fungal strain construction for the production of industrial secondary metabolite or lignocellulose hydrolytic enzymes.

61	Michael O. Hottiger	University of Zurich	Department of Molecular Mechanisms of Diseas Universität Zürich-Irchel	2011-10-01	2014-09-30	Functional analysis of nuclear protein ADP-ribosylation during NF-?B dependent gene expression	Background:Inflammation (innate immunity) is the defensive frontline that coordinates the organism’s response to injury and infection. The major intracellular contributor for the induction of this response is the transcription factor NF-?B. Understanding the regulatory mechanism of NF-?B dependent gene expression is thus biologically as well a medically relevant.It is becoming clear that NF-?B-mediated transcriptional activation is coordinated by the synergistic interaction of various cofactors and signalling networks. Histone modifications are being recognised as critical player in this orchestration of NF-?B’s function. In my group, we have started to investigate the influence of ARTD1 (formally called PARP-1) on the structure and composition of chromatin. We have established a method for the analysis of ADP-ribosylated peptides by mass spectrometry (MS) and electron-transfer dissociation (ETD) and have published that ARTD1 is able to ADP-ribosylate peptides at specific lysine residues. Our own preliminary data further reveal that ARTD1 is indeed able to ADP-ribosylate histones in permeabilised nuclei. Moreover, we have observed that ARTD1 and its enzymatic activity modulate transcription of a subset of NF-?B target genes by regulating histone modifications (e.g. H3K4me3) at the transcriptional start site (unpublished data based on inhibitor studies and ARTD1 knockdown cells). Working hypothesis:Based on our published and preliminary data, we hypothesize that the ADP-ribosylation activity of ARTD1 is affecting endogenous NF-?B-dependent gene expression either directly by modifying histones or indirectly by altering histone modifying enzymes. Specific aims:Following this hypothesis, the first aim of the proposed project is the identification of nuclear protein ADP-ribosylation after inflammatory or metaflammatory signalling (sub-project 1). The identified proteins will be divided into histones and histone modifying enzymes, which will be characterized separately in regard to their involvement in NF-?B-dependent gene expression (sub-projects 2 & 3). The impact of the main nuclear ADP-ribosylating enzymes ARTD1 and ARTD2 on specific ADP-ribose modifications will be analysed in a fourth sub-project (sub-project 4). Experimental design/methods:Standard and recently developed molecular and cell biology techniques will be applied to perform the research described in this grant proposal. Since the cellular chromatin is a very important aspect to be analyzed, primary cells isolated from animals with different genetic backgrounds as well as different available mouse and human cells will be included in these studies. All necessary facilities and expertise for these technologies are available in the laboratory.Expected value of the proposed project:This proposal is the logical extension of our past research and aims to identify and study ADP-ribosylated nuclear proteins that are important for NF-?B-dependent gene expression. As in my last SNF program, we plan to carry out the planed work with four Ph.D. students over the period of three years. It is an important goal of this project to analyse the intricate, reciprocal regulation of histone modification and the NF-?B pathway. The long-term goal of these studies is to understand the effect of nuclear ADP-ribosylation on the NF-?B enhanceosome network that leads to acute or chronic inflammation or during obesity to metabolic disorders. These results will also consolidate the importance of NF-?B during inflammatory and metaflammatory signalling and may generate new hypotheses about the onset and development of diseases and disorders linked to this signalling pathway.

For these diseases either stimulation or blocking, respectively, of angiogenesis may provide novel treatment options. Advancing State-of-the-Art: Our hypothesis is that in ischemia it will be possible to support natural growth of blood vessels with Therapeutic angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis by using local gene transfer of the new members of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family and their receptors. New co-receptors, designer mutants and PCR suffling products of VEGFs will be used. New vector technology will be used to achieve long-lasting effects of VEGFs. We aim to develop novel site-specifically integrating, targeted, regulated vectors to precisely express the new VEGFs, their soluble decoy receptors and single-chain therapeutic antibodies (scFv) for pro- and anti-angiogenic purposes. As novel approaches, we have developed metabolically biotinylated lenti- and adenoviruses suitable for targeting and Epigenetherapy where siRNA/miRNAs and short nuclear RNAs regulate endogenous gene expression at the VEGF promoter level via modification of histone code. scFv library for endothelial cells and lentivirus-siRNA library directed to all human and mouse kinases will be screened to identify new mediators of angiogenesis in order to develop next generation pro- and antiangiogenic therapies. Based on our strong track record in Clinical applications, the best new pro- and antiangiogenic approaches will be taken to phase I clinical studies in myocardial ischemia and malignant glioma. Significance: This work should lead to significant advances and new therapies for severe ischemia and malignant glioma. Epigenetherapy and new site-specifically integrating, regulated vectors should be widely applicable in medicine.	European Research Council	Advanced Grant	2200000.0	EUR
63	Prof Hugh Patterton	University of the Free State	None	2000-03-01	2005-02-28	The role of linker histone H1 in chromatin structure and the regulation of gene expression.	It is well established that the nucleosomal packaging of DNA in eukaryotes has an effect on the regulation of transcription, replication, recombination and tumorigenesis. This effect, which is mediated by the masking of the DNA molecule, is modulated by linker histone H1, covalent modification of the core histone N-terminal regions, and ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling complexes such as SWI/SNF. I have recently biochemically identified and phenotypically characterised a linker histon H1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. (Patterton et al. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 7628-7276). In this proposed research programme the role of linker histone H1 in chromatin structure and the regulation of gene expression will be investigated. Individual projects will include a study of the structural functionality of the proposed second globular domain of yeast H1. The cell cycle dependent expression, post-translational modification, deposition and genomic distribution of H1 will also be studied and related to DNA function. I also plan to identify genes that display an altered level of expression in the WT versus the H1r strain, and to study the transcriptional response of the identified genes to chromatin structure in further detail.

By a combination of robust epigenetic analyses and finely-tuned molecular experiments we will address the following objectives: (i) dissecting the BTK-responsive enhancer landscape in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) (ii) modelling the epigenetic and transcriptional temporal dynamics of BTKi-resistance (iii) elucidating the specificity of BTK-responsive epigenome and identifying novel biomarkers for BTKi resistance Over the last year our knowledge regarding the chromatin landscape in CLL has exponentially grown and histone modification states have emerged as a vital component of CLL biology. In parallel with the progress on epigenomics, the treatment paradigm in CLL is shifting from nonspecific chemo/immunotherapy to targeted therapies, of which Ibrutinib has shown remarkable efficacy. Given the emerging importance of chromatin landscape in CLL, we hypothesized that BTKi may affect transcriptional dynamics by a shift on histone marks profiles. We have recently shown that H3K27ac patterns are distinct between pre- and post- Ibrutinib CLL patients and we provided first evidence that BTKi effects at the cellular level can be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms involving rewiring of distinct enhancer loci. The proposed work will build upon these data in order to elucidate the role of epigenomics in BTKi resistance for 1st/2nd generation BTKi and to discover stratification biomarkers. These outcomes can significantly contribute to tailored treatment decisions and pave the way for epigenetically-relevant combinatorial therapies.

65	Dr Olivier Binda	Newcastle University	None	2013-08-12	2014-08-11	The role of the lysine methyltransferase SETD6 in breast carcinomas development and metastasis	Epigenetic mechanisms are major contributors to chemo-resistance of breast cancer (BC) patients. I have recently described the post-translational modification of the histone variant H2AZ[1], a key player in BC cellular proliferation[2] and regulation of ER-dependent transcription[3], by the epigenetic factor SETD6, a lysine methyltransferase (KMT). Preliminary experiments indicate that estrogen-responsive genes are downregulated in SETD6-depleted mammary cells. Since SETD6 is required for the self-renewal of embryonic stem (ES) cells[1] and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which facilitates BC metastasis, generates poorly differentiated cells with stem-like features, I thus propose to further investigate SETD6-associated proteins and develop cellular models to study the role of SETD6 in BC metastasis. Aims The main objective is to initiate studies of the role of SETD6 in BC, develop the cellular systems required for those studies, and assemble a comprehensive grant proposal with the following aims: Characterize the SETD6-MTA2 complex Define the role of SETD6 in BC metastasis Investigate the potential role of SETD6 and H2AZ in the EMT Identify KMTs involved in the EMT Techniques and Methodology SETD6 will be purified from stably expressing FLAG-SETD6 BC cell lines. The immunoprecipitates will be analyzed by immunoblotting using commercially available antibodies. The role of SETD6 in BC metastasis will be assessed by standard migration assays in vitro in control cells and SETD6-silenced cells. EMT will be induced in mammary epithelial cells as described[4, 5]. The transition efficiency will be assessed by measuring the expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers. These cells will be used to investigate the role of SETD6 and identify other KMTs during EMT. Impact on breast cancer research Potentially, I will establish a role for SETD6 in BC development and metastasis. This knowledge could eventually be translated in the development of novel epigenetic-based therapies or diagnostics.	Breast Cancer Now	Pilot	19023.0	GBP

The most common leukaemic disruptions of the MLL1 gene are chromosome translocations that fuse the N terminus of MLL1 in frame with over 40 different partner genes creating novel fusion proteins. Recent work has suggested that wild type MLL1 and MLL1 fusion proteins cooperate in leukaemogenesis by together causing aberrant epigenetic profiles at target genes in vivo. Epigenetic changes are often defined as heritable changes in gene expression or chromosome stability that don’t alter the underlying DNA sequence. We are interested in identifying the key molecular events in MLL1 mediated leukaemogenesis in order to fully understand the epigenetic basis for this disease. This major goal has been divided into three key questions: 1) What key downstream gene targets are essential for MLL1 mediated leukaemogenesis?; 2) how do MLL1 and MLL1 fusion proteins control epigenetic gene regulation on a molecular level?; and 3) how are MLL1 and MLL1 fusion proteins recruited to important gene targets in the cell? To answer these questions, we are using xenograft transplant assays to identify Leukaemic Stem Cells (LSCs) in MLL1 patient samples, ChIP-seq to identify and characterise direct gene targets in specific haematopoietic cell populations, small molecular inhibitors and siRNA combined with ChIP and ChIP-seq to determine how MLL1 fusion proteins regulate gene targets in the cell and MLL1 domain analysis coupled with genome wide techniques to determine how MLL1 is recruited to gene targets in the cell. Answering these questions may not only be useful for future therapeutic strategies, but will also inform our basic understanding of epigenetic gene regulation during normal stem and progenitor cell development.

Therefore the study of disease-relevant tissues is a fundamental requisite to interpret these associations, but has so far been hampered by the lack of appropriate human cellular models. The technology of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which can be differentiated into a variety of cell types, offers a powerful, yet unexplored tool to functionally characterize human regulatory variants. My goal is to demonstrate the utility of using human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) to understand how DNA variants influence cardiomyocyte molecular phenotypes. In the first part of my postdoc in the Frazer laboratory at UCSD, I have generated iPSC-CMs from seven members of an extended family and profiled them using multiple functional epigenomic assays including RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq of two transcription factors (NKX2-5 and SRF) and one histone modification (H3K27ac), and ATAC-Seq to identify regions of open chromatin. We have also generated whole genome sequences from germline DNA of the seven family members. I am currently analyzing these datasets to assess the consistency of the iPSC-CMs in expressing typical cardiac gene expression and epigenetic signatures and to evaluate the role non-coding genetic variants play in influencing cardiac molecular phenotypes. In this fellowship, I propose to conduct further computational analyses of these datasets to prove that iPSC-CMs are a powerful model to study genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying cardiac biology and cardiovascular disease. In a second project, I am studying the molecular effect of a long QT type II mutation segregating in this family with incomplete penetrance. The mutation causes a truncation of KCNH2 resulting in NMD of its transcript. In this fellowship I propose to characterize the electrophysiological properties of iPSC-CMs from the individuals of this family to determine if there are differences between the affected individuals, asymptomatic individuals carrying the mutation and control family members.

Through our research funded by the SNF we identified the CDKs and the Polycomb component BMI1 as the key actors during the process of photoreceptor death studied in the Rd1 mouse retina: the in vivo inhibition of Bmi1 rescues around 70% of the photoreceptors and significantly preserves cone function (Zencak et al., PNAS 2013). Because Polycomb proteins regulate gene expression by chromatin modifications, other members of this family were studied. We observed that the histone methyltransferase EZH2 is expressed during the early degenerative stage and results in the methylation of H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a histone modification maintaining gene inhibition. Interestingly, the pattern of H3K27me3 mark observed in our studies correlates with that of degenerating photoreceptors. In vivo EZH2 inhibition by a chemical compound protects around 50% of photoreceptors. Thus, the major objective of this project is to identify the epigenetic mechanisms controlling cell death events with a special focus on those involving cell cycle protein regulation. The importance of EZH2 in the regulation of the photoreceptor death process will be challenged in vivo. We are currently performing ChIP-Seq studies for the different histone marks as well as for BMI1 in order to identify which genes are differently controlled by the Polycomb protein during retinal degeneration. The results will reveal candidate genes which will be correlated with the data of the EZH2 ablation studies, as well with RNA-Seq and micro-RNA array studies that will be undertaken in this project with WT, Rd1 and Rd1;Bmi1-/- mouse retina. The overall analysis should disclose which pathways are regulated by the Polycomb proteins during the process of photoreceptor loss using new algorithms we recently developed.The biology of human photoreceptor death is poorly known. Human retina explants will be cultivated with PDE6 inhibitors to induce photoreceptor death, allowing the study of human mechanisms of degeneration. The death process identified in mouse retinas will be compared with the data from the human samples. In order to model the human disease in vitro without the problem of tissue source, human iPS cell lines will be engineered by a CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing approach to knock-down the PDE6B gene. These different models combined with the results obtained with mouse material will help to identify candidate genes involved in the photoreceptor death process. The different candidates will be cloned into plasmids and challenged by electroporation into Rd1 retina explants (and then studied in vivo) to evaluate their role on the death mechanisms. These experiments will allow to link the systems involving EZH2, BMI1 and CDKs in the progression of the photoreceptor death with other pathways. Since we observed that BMI1 plays a major role in cell death control, the mechanisms regulating its actions will help to identify targets that can be relevant for therapeutic intervention.

Centromeres play an integral role in segregation of chromosomes by providing a platform for kinetochore formation while at the same time being a paradigm for the formation of a transcriptionally silent chromatin environment. Proper maintenance of heterochromatin is crucial for genome maintenance on a single cell level and for the maintenance of cell identity in multicellular organisms with critical implications for metabolism, aging and diseases such as cancer.Recent findings, particularly in the fission yeast S. pombe, have identified transcription, RNAi related processes, histone modification and nucleosome remodeling as critical and tightly interconnected regulators of centromere function and specification. However, details pertaining to the structure and molecular mechanism of many aspects are still lacking. My experience with nucleosome arrays during my PhD thesis, as well as my postdoctoral expertise gained in working with protein complexes gives me a solid background and the necessary skills to guide an independent research group focused on the characterization of specific aspects of centromere function in S. pombe. Through the use of X-ray crystallography, molecular biology, biophysical approaches and biochemical characterization I will pursue my research with the following aims:Aim 1: Structure of the SHREC complex. The SNF2/HDAC remodeling complex SHREC is the S. pombe homologue of the mammalian Mi-2/NuRD complex with critical roles in transcriptional gene silencing and establishment of heterochromatin. In order to understand the function and reg- ulation of this class of chromatin remodelers I propose to characterize the structure and function of SHREC through genetic, biochemical and X-ray crystallographic analysis.Aim 2: The chromatin structure of S. pombe. The architecture of chromatin has a strong influence on processes acting on the underlying genomic material. In order to understand the three-dimensional configuration of nucleosomes in vivo, I propose to characterize S. pombe-like nucleosome arrays by X-ray crystallography and to develop the technologies necessary to reconstitute specific genomic environments faithfully in vitro.Aim 3: Structure of the chromatin-kinetochore interface. Kinetochores attach spindle microtubules to chromosomes for the proper segregation of the genetic material to daughter cells. With the aim of understanding this process in detail, I propose to investigate the structure and function of the CENP-A associated kinetochore complexes of S. pombe by X-ray crystallography.These research efforts will yield fundamental insights of unprecedented detail into chromosome biology. Getting access to the structures of the studied complex macromolecules will provide a wealth of information about their function on the genome, and will reveal basic principles that are shared with evolutionarily related complexes in humans and other organisms. Therefore, the proposed research carries the potential to advance our understanding of health, disease and the development of therapies.

This proposal aims to define the causal variants at loci associated with autoimmune diseases, by studying the effects of of associated variants on CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs). Objectives: Specifically, I will 1) construct a catalogue of chromatin and gene activity in Tregs from 100 individuals, 2) functionally prioritise putative causal variants based on their effects on gene regulatory features, as well as 3) gene and cytokine expression levels and 4) assess if the observed effects are specific cellular states, resting or stimulated. Methodology: Dr Trynka's group is generating functional genomic data from Tregs from 100 healthy blood donors. The assays include: 1) genome wide genotyping, 2) characterising active promoters by ChIP-seq for H3K4me3 histone modification , 3) mapping open chromatin regions using ATAC-seq, and 4) quantifying gene expression with RNA-seq. Assays 2-4 include both resting and stimulated Tregs. Using these datasets I will identify genetic variants that co-localise with H3K4me3 and ATAC features and test for correlation between alleles and the number of mapped sequence reads. Variants with allele-specific effects on histone modification levels or chromatin accessibility will comprise a pool of prioritised causal variants. I will further correlate these alleles with gene expression levels and assess the genetic effects on cytokine levels. Finally, if a subset of nominated causal alleles point to disrupted transcription factor binding (TF), I will perform functional validation using TF-specific ChIP-seq. Scientific and medical opportunities: We will gain insights into the causal molecular mechanisms underlying the immune disease loci that may lead to identification of novel drug targets and disease biomarkers. Finally, the framework proposed here can be easily adapted to other cell types and complex traits.	Medical Research Council	Fellowship	259873.0	GBP

Three types of epigenetic alterations are currently believed to be causally implicated in providing cancer cells with the ability to drive tumor growth and progression, namely DNA methylation, chromatin remodelling as a result of covalent histone modifications and non-coding RNAs, particularly microRNAs (miRNA). Precise understanding of such mechanisms may help identify a set of targets for the development of new therapeutic strategies.The cancer stem cell (CSC) model was revived in recent years with the notion that a tumor initiating cell acquires increased self-renewal capacity through genetic mutations and epigenetic modification, maintaining the tumor drive indefinitely. CSC express various embryonic stem cell genes, including CD133, often used a stem cell marker. CSC are capable to reproduce the original tumor in vivo upon injection in immunocompromised mice, thereby giving birth to heterogenous cell subpopulations, composed of CSC as well as more differentiated progeny. As they are more prone to chemotherapy resistance, it can be conceived that targeting and eradicating CSC may lead to cure of cancers in which CSC provide the driving force for growth and progression.In the case of Ewing’s sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT), a group of rare but highly aggressive tumors arising in mesenchymal tissue in children and young adults, conventional chemotherapies are not sufficient to effectively treat patients and prevent relapse, primarily due to early metastasis. 85% of ESFT present a single mutation, the translocation t(11;22), leading to the formation of an aberrant fusion protein EWS-FLI1.The epigenetic state of primary cells is believed to determine whether they may or may not be permissive for oncogene-induced transformation. Thus, in depth understanding of epigenetically regulated cell permissiveness for oncogene expression and the mechanisms that regulate epigenetic changes upon transformation are key steps toward developing rational mechanism-based targeted anti-cancer therapies.The aim of my project will be to further investigate the role of epigenetics in regard to EWS-FLI1 by identifying and characterizing CSC and exploring how epigenetic alterations lead to their emergence and direct their tumor initiating and metastasis promoting properties.1- Determination and analysis of ESFT cells signature epigenetic profile.First, I will describe the epigenetic profile of spherogenic and adherent ESFT cells. I will address the epigenetic markers changes between the more tumorigenic sphere-forming cells and the adherent cells by focusing on histone methylation and acetylation.2- Determination of chromatin modification in CD133+ versus CD133- cells.Secondly, I will determine chromatin modifications in CD133+ versus CD133- cells. These cells will be isolated from fresh human tumor samples or from ESFT propagated in immunocompromised mice. I will also assess the influence of human versus murine microenvironment on CD133+ epigenetic markers.3- Assessment of epigenetic changes that underlie cell permissiveness for EWS-FLI1 expression and function.Finally, as EZH2 has been shown to facilitate EWS-FLI1 expression in fibroblasts, I will perform RNA-seq gene expression comparison between cells transduced with EZH2 and their control counterparts. I will then perform ChIP-seq on both sets of fibroblasts to identify EZH2-induced chromatin mark changes and correlate them with gene expression data. Selected genes could be tested for responsibility in blocking or enhancing permissiveness for EWS-FLI1 expression.The major contribution of this work will be to assess epigenetic differences between fresh primary tumor initiating and non-tumorigenic bulk tumor cells in ESFT. Such a study has never been done in part because of the paucity of primary tumor samples and in part because of the challenge of nano-ChIP-seq technology. My host lab provides me with the possibility to overcome both obstacles as it possesses and continues to obtain primary ESFT samples and has established nano-ChIP-seq technology. In addition, the project will assess the effect of in vitro culture and mouse propagation on CSC and non-CSC ESFT populations, which is a central issue toward understanding how well cultured tumor cells and tumor cells grown in mice represent the corresponding fresh primary cells. Finally, the project will define the epigenetic events that convert a non-permissive to a permissive cellular environment for EWS-FLI-1 expression and function, which will provide important and long sought insight into the pathogenesis of ESFT.

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with no cure. Drugs only treat the motor symptoms of the disease and do not prevent neuronal death. Neuroprotective therapies can only be developed when we fully understand the neurodegenerative process. There is growing interest in the role of epigenetics in PD. There are two principal epigenetic mechanisms, DNA methylation and histone modification, which can regulate gene transcription. Histone acetylation by histone acetyltransferases (HAT’s) leads to chromatin relaxation promoting gene expression, whilst histone deacetylation by histone deacetylase (HDAC’s) causes chromatin condensation and suppression of gene expression. Hence, epigenetic changes can lead to the expression of cell death genes or proteins e.g.alpha-synuclein, associated with neurodegenerative process and/or the reduction in cell survival factors. There are 18 HDAC isoforms. Recently, Dexter’s laboratory has detected changes in the level of histone acetylation and the gene expression of a number of HDAC isoforms in areas of the PD brain which degenerate compared to controls. This preliminary data supports the hypothesis that aberrant epigenetic changes may be involved in PD. This project builds on this data and will assess whether there are any changes in HDAC protein levels and assess whether such changes correlate with disease progression.

The advent of high-throughput technologies to map in vivo DNA-protein complexes, in particular chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with ultrahigh-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) raises new hope for a breakthrough. For the first time it is possible to obtain a comprehensive and detailed view of the chromatin structure of an entire genome in a particular cell type. In addition, we are now able to identify the complete repertoire of in vivo binding sites for a given transcription factor under given conditions. In other words, the molecular events that control gene expression in proximity to the DNA suddenly have become visible. The genome-wide ChIP-Seq datasets that have become available over the last year, already led to numerous new insights about gene regulation. We anticipate that very large volumes of similar data will be released during the course of the proposed project. Computational analysis of ChIP-Seq data is in its infancy. For computational biology, the next few years will probably be remembered as a learning phase during which the community has acquired experience how to make best use of this new type of molecular data. Standard protocols for quality-control and low level data processing will arise. The type of biological questions that can be answered will be better defined and stated in terms amenable to computational approaches. Appropriate data structures for higher level analysis will arise and methodological principles and algorithm will consolidate over time. This proposal is meant to be a contribution to this learning process. The focus is on higher level analysis and interpretation, not on primary data processing. Specifically we are interested in questions concerning the relationship between DNA sequence, chromatin structure, transcriptional activation and repression. A key question in gene regulation, especially with regard to large higher eukaryotic genomes, is why a given transcription factor binds only to a subset of potential target sites in the genome. Much of the proposed work is devoted directly or indirectly to this problem. Histone modification maps based on ChIP-Seq provide clues about DNA accessibility, transcriptional status, and other physiological processes acting on a gene regulatory region. Classification and categorization will help to define subsets of genomic regions that offer similar conditions for transcription factor binding. Information on evolutionary conservation may further direct our analyses to functionally relevant chromatin regions. Comprehensive maps of in vivo transcription factor binding sites provide ideal training and test sets for machine learning approaches that may help to answer the key question of what directs gene regulatory proteins to their physiological target sites. Our research will be mostly biological question-driven in this sense. In addition to methodological advances, we hope that the proposed work will lead to a number of specific and experimentally testable hypotheses regarding chromatin-modulated gene regulatory mechanisms.

How this is accomplished is an important question. We have shown that chromatin remodelling factors play an important role in the maintenance of the epigenome. Recently in collaboration with the group of Marc Veldhoen (Babraham Institute), we found that such a factor plays a role of interest in the maintenance of correct histone modification profile and gene expression in intestinal stem cells and loss of this factor leads to aberrant regulation of genes normally expressed in other tissues. Furthermore, loss of this factor leads to defects in intestinal immunity. In the proposed programme, we will examine if aging, inflammation and inflammation linked to aging (inflammaging) also lead to short and long-term changes in the epigenomes and gene expression programme of intestinal stem cells. Furthermore, using transcriptome and proteome analysis we will find out what are the mechanisms and pathways that lead to such changes. We will use the mouse as model system and will collaborate with several teams at Babraham Institute and elsewhere.	Medical Research Council	None	None	None
75	Dr Timothy Humphrey	University of Oxford	None	2017-04-01	2022-03-31	Understanding how genome stability is maintained in response to chromosomal breaks.	Histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) methylation plays a central role in both orchestrating the DNA damage response (DDR) and in suppressing tumorigenesis. We have discovered key roles for H3K36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) in the DDR where it both promotes homologous recombination (HR) repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (Pfister et al., Cell Reports 2014), and is also essential for DNA replication restart following replication stress resulting from checkpoint kinase inactivation (Pfister et al., Cancer Cell 2015). Accordingly SETD2-dependent H3K36me3 is frequently depleted in a number of cancer types, including high-grade pediatric gliomas (>50%), and metastatic renal carcinomas (~60%), for which prognosis is poor. We recently exploited a conserved synthetic lethal relationship we identified in fission yeast to target H3K36me3-deficient cancers, using the WEE1 inhibitor, AZD1775, which is already in Phase II clinical trials. As a result of these studies, together with the development of a biomarker to detect H3K36me3 loss in patient tissue, the use of AZD1775 to target H3K36me3-deficient cancers has now been adopted into the MRC-supported FOCUS4 clinical trial. Despite these advances, how H3K36me3 coordinates these distinct DDR functions is unknown. Moreover, the extent to which this synthetic lethal relationship can be expanded and translated into the clinic has not yet been explored. We therefore propose to determine how H3K36me3 maintains viability in response to replication stress, thereby better understanding this synthetic lethality (Aim 1); to delineate the role of the H3K36me3 pathway in homologous recombination repair (Aim 2); and to further translate these findings into the clinic through identifying other targetable disease sites, by determining the AZD1775 sensitivity of cancers with intermediate H3K36me3 levels, by improving cancer targeting through combining AZD1775 with other agents, including ionizing radiation, and by understanding the mechanisms and pathways leading to AZD1775 resistance (Aim 3). We will use a powerful combination of yeast and mammalian genetics, together with small molecular inhibitors to achieve these aims. We anticipate that the proposed research will provide mechanistic insights into how histone H3K36 trimethylation promotes DSB repair and maintains cell viability in response to such replication stress. Further, we predict that by expanding this synthetic lethal relationship through genetic triangulation we will broaden both the biological and clinical application of our findings.
