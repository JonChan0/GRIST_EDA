It is now well established in many fungi that SMGCs are silenced by heterochromatin formation and activated by wide-domain and pathway-specific regulators.

All this together will provide a more detailed mechanistic view on chromatin-level regulation of SMGCs and their insulation from the surrounding genomic regions and will also provide possibilities for epigenetic engineering to activate orphan SMGCs and find novel metabolites. </span></span></p> <p><span style="font-size:medium"><span style="font-family:Calibri"><strong>Involved scientists:</strong><strong> </strong>Joseph Strauss&acute; lab has pioneered studies in chromatin-level regulation of fungal gene clusters in primary and secondary metabolism.
