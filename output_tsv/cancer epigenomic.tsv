We believe that these minor events are critical factors in the emergence of the cancer phenotype, and that understanding them is essential to the characterization of the disease. In particular, we hypothesize that a quantitative and principled evolutionary model for carcinogenesis is imperative for understanding the heterogeneity within tumor cell populations and predicting the effects of cancer therapies. We will therefore develop an interdisciplinary scheme that combines theoretical models of cancer evolution with in vitro evolutionary experiments and new methods for assaying the population heterogeneity of epigenomic organization. By developing techniques to interrogate DNA methylation and its interaction with other key epigenetic marks at the single-cell level, we will allow quantitative theoretical predictions to be scrutinized and refined. By combining models describing epigenetic aberrations with direct measurements of chromatin organization using Hi-C and 4C-seq, we shall revisit fundamental questions on the causative nature of epigenetic changes during carcinogenesis. Ultimately, we will apply both theoretical and experimental methodologies to assay and characterize the evolutionary histories of tumor cell populations from multiple mouse models and clinical patient samples.

This plasticity plays an important role in cancer progression and tumour heterogeneity. We have made a striking observation that cancer cells of different origin can switch to a common survival state. During this epigenomic reprogramming, cancer cells re-activate genomic enhancers from specific regulatory programs, such as wound repair and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. The goal of my project is to decipher the enhancer logic underlying this canalization effect towards a common survival state. We will then employ this new understanding of enhancer logic to engineer synthetic enhancers that are able to monitor and manipulate cell-state switching in real time. Furthermore, we will use enhancer models to identify cis-regulatory mutations that have an impact on cell-state switching and drug resistance. Such applications are currently hampered because there is a significant gap in our understanding of how enhancers work. To tackle this problem we will use a combination of in vivo massively parallel enhancer-reporter assays, single-cell genomics on microfluidic devices, computational modelling, and synthetic enhancer design. Using these approaches we will pursue the following aims: (1) to identify functional enhancers regulating cell-state switching by performing in vivo genetic screens in mice; (2) to elucidate the dynamic trajectories whereby cells of different cancer types switch to a common survival cell-state, at single-cell resolution; (3) to create synthetic enhancer circuits that specifically kill cancer cells undergoing cell-state switching. Our findings will have an impact on genome research, characterizing how cellular decision making is implemented by the cis-regulatory code; and on cancer research, employing enhancer logic in the context of cancer therapy.

For instance, somatic biallelic loss of CDK12, somatic/germline mutations in DNA-repair pathway, and their therapeutic vulnerability to poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase inhibitors is well-established in Caucasian PCa cohorts. However, mutational landscape of PCa patients from India and their clinical significance is largely unknown. To understand the disease-pathobiology and redefine therapeutic targets for these patients, here, we aim to explore the genomic aberrations prevalent in PCa patients from India. We will perform in-depth multi-platform comprehensive profiling (Whole-Exome Sequencing and RNA-Sequencing) of a discovery-cohort (n=50), and targeted gene-panel (~2000) approach for validation cohort, subsequently develop a focused ~200 gene-panel as a prototype for future clinical-testing. Moreover, we will also establish PCa patient-derived organoids (PDO) and PDO-xenografts for genomic characterization and potential drug-screening, which retains similar genetic-signatures and therapeutic-response as patients. Finally, we aim to develop tumor cell-free DNA/exosome-based diagnostics for detecting clinically-relevant androgen-receptor mutations and splice-variants, which predicts resistance to abiraterone and enzalutamide, and would assist in treatment selection of castration-resistant patients. The proposed study will provide the much-needed information of the contributing genetic/epigenetic events in Indian PCa cohort, and allow clinicians/urologists to re-visit the disease management-strategies.
