We will expand, and further characterise the genetic and epigenetic changes in our panel of colorectal cancer derived cell lines, including the use of whole genome micro-array gene expression technology. We will further investigate CDX1 and 2, as well as SFRP and CEA expression, and their control by promoter methylation and demethylation especially in adenomas and intestinal metaplasias. Primary tumour tissue will be used for clinical validation of the changes found in the cell lines. Studies on the distinctive anti CEA antibody, PR1A3, its ADCC activity and the use of a Min/CEA preclinical model will be pursued. Our approaches to the detection of rare tumour cells in blood and other tissues as a basis for early diagnosis, in collaboration with the company Ikonisys and using their automated scanning microscope, will be further developed. We will expand the search for rare variants in candidate genes as a basis for inherited susceptibility to multiple colorectal adenomas and other tumours, and also continue our general population studies.

1	Professor Sir Walter Bodmer	University of Oxford	None	2005-10-01	2009-09-30	Role of methylation in colorectal cancer and intestinal metaplasias	A cancer is defined by its genetic and epigenetic changes. Methylation is now known to be a key epigenetic change for a number of genes in different cancers. This application is a contribution to our overall studies on gene methylation in colorectal and certain other cancers, and in intestinal metaplasias. For this analysis we use a panel of nearly 100 already well characterised colorectal cancer derived lines. Micro-array gene expression differences between control and 5 aza -2 deoxy- cytidine(5aza2) treated cell lines are being used to search for genes whose expression is likely to be affected by methylation. The methylation patterns in the promoter regions of selected genes are then established using the MassArray technology.This provides direct estimates of the extent to which each CpG in an island in the promoter region is methylated. The pattern of methylation can then be correlated with mRNA and protein expression of the gene to establish its functional relevance. The associations between the genetic and epigenetic changes can be correlated with each other and appropriately clustered to define functional pathways that are changed in the cancers. We have shown that methylation control of CDX1 is most probably a key step in the initiation of intestinal metaplasia and an important early step in a significant proportion of colorectal cancers. Gene expression differences between various sources of CDX1 expressing and non expressing cell lines are being used to search for genes that are regulated down stream by CDX1, as well as by its partner, CDX2. This has provided evidence for Keratin 20 as being CDX1 controlled .The expression of Keratin20 is associated with several other potential markers of differentiation.It appears likely that these patterns of expression reflect the difference between cancer stem cells in the cultures, which do not generally express these markers, and the progenitor cells derived from the cancer stem cells , which do. We are now using these patterns of expression to explore the characterisation of cancer stem cells in our cell line panel.	Cancer Research UK	Studentship	None	None

However, it has long been recognised that a key component of this process is the accompanying changes in the extracellular matrix and stromal cells which are essential for cancer invasion and a pre-requisite for the formation of secondary tumours. Endol 80 is a multidomain endocytic tansmembrane receptor. The restricted cell type distribution of Endol 80 and its upregulation in the tumour microenvironment, together with data demonstrating that this constitutively recycling receptor can bind and internalize collagens, interact with the uPA/uPAR protease system and promote both cell migration and chemotaxis has led us to propose a role for Endol 80 in both normal and pathological tissue remodelling. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo assays, we will seek to address two key issues in this proposal, (1) what is the mechanism by which Endol 80 promotes cell migration ad chemotaxis and in particular how does this endocytic receptor integrate into the signalling pathways activated in response to growth factors or the extracellular matrix, and (2) what is the effect of stromal Endol 80 expression in promoting an invasive phenotype in tumour cells.

Aberrant DNA methylation of promoter sequences in tumours leads to stable silencing of tumour suppressor genes and provides the modified cells with growth advantage similar to mutations or deletions. DNA methylation operates through a family of methyl-CpG binding proteins (MBDs) which act as a transcriptional repressors. At present the genomic target sequences for individual MBD proteins have not been identified, neither has it been postulated what, apart from the number of methylated CpGs, may determine the specificity of their binding in vivo. The work in my laboratory is focussed on identification of MBD proteins that are most commonly involved in the transcriptional repression of genes in lung cancer. We are using an approach based on chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to determine the genomic binding sites for the individual proteins of MBD family in vivo in normal and cancer cells. We are also investigating the functional aspects of gene silencing by MBD proteins and their role in the establishment of nuclear chromatin architecture. As a potential approach that may serve as a strategy for an anti-cancer therapy we are investigating whether interference with the function of MBD proteins in vivo leads to re-activation of methylation-silenced tumour suppressor genes. In addition we are trying to address the mechanisms that lead to the establishment of aberrant patterns of DNA methylation during the initial events of tumorigenesis. Altogether our research aims to elucidate the epigenetic controls of gene function and their contribution to the appearance and maintenance of specific tumour cell types.

The patterns of DNA methylation in cancers are modified in a complex manner relative to those in normal tissues - in most cases tumours display overall genome hypomethylation, which is accompanied by the appearance of methylated CpGs in promoter-associated, and usually methylation-free, CG rich sequences (CpG islands). This project aims to investigate the chromatin remodelling properties of SNF-like helicase PASG, and to determine whether PASG is able to recruit de novo DNA methyltransferase activities to gene promoters in cancer cells. The information derived from this research may elucidate the mechanisms underlying the origin of the complex epigenetic changes in cancer genomes and, due to the potential role of PASG as an oncogene, may produce new targets for therapeutic strategies.

On top of this genetic information the genome also contains epigenetic information in the form of chemical and other modifications to DNA, which are associated with gene expression and genome function. Epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation are of key importance in development, stem cell biology and regenerative medicine, and cancer. During certain periods of early development of an embryo, epigenetic modifications including DNA methylation are reprogrammed on a genome wide level. This may be important in order to establish totipotency (the ability to give rise to an entire organism) of the embryonic genome. The mechanisms of the removal of DNA methylation from the genome are unknown in mammals. This student project investigates a class of candidate enzymes in the mouse which have been shown to be able to chemically alter methylated cytosines. There are four of these candidate genes in the mouse genome, for three of which we have knockout mutations (to create inactive genes). A fourth knockout is being constructed, and knockouts will then be examined for altered DNA methylation, development, and possible effects on cancer risk.

7	Dr Michaela Frye	University of Cambridge	None	2007-02-01	2013-01-31	Functional analysis of the proto-oncogene Myc in adult epidermal stem cell self-renewal and differentiation	The transcription factor Myc promotes tumourigenesis in mice and humans but its functions in non-malignant cells remain enigmatic. Recent studies have revealed a role in regulating adult stem cell homeostasis. Activation of the Myc/Miz1 complex induces exit from the stem cell compartment by directly repressing genes involved in cellular adhesion. Once the stem cells have left the niche, Myc induces cell proliferation via growth promoting target genes like Misu, a novel RNA methyltransferase. I have obtained evidence that during these rounds of cell division Myc and possibly also Misu establish chromatin modifications that might regulate differentiation into specific epidermal lineages. Knowledge of the mechanisms that regulate cell proliferation and epigenetic changes in normal tissues will provide new strategies for cancer treatment. The aim of my proposal is to analyse the epigenetic and transcriptional changes regulated by Myc that trigger the exit of epidermal stem cells from their niche. To analyse the function of Misu in vivo, I will generate a loss of function mouse model. To further dissect how Myc regulates cell adhesion and proliferation, I will analyse dominant negative mutants of Myc. Finally, I will identify chromatin modifications of direct Myc/Miz1 target genes to determine epigenetic changes that might be responsible for lineage commitment in skin.

Initial focus will be on the evaluation of 4 targets currently in the drug development phase. We have focussed on areas that exploit existing biological and clinical expertise in cancer relevant areas at IC: transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of gene expression, particularly as related to hormone-dependent signalling pathways in breast and prostate (Bevan/Waxman) cancer, and stress responses or resistance to current chemotherapies. One target (CDK7) is the ?Lead Optimisation' phase, with sets of compounds already selected for optimisation on the basis of biological screens. Following the move to London of Professor Brown, we have one ?hit to lead' project: the methylation/ MBD programme. We have synthesised preliminary sets of compounds, following the award of the Medicinal Chemistry Training award, targetted against the molecular target SIRT1 and we will start research on LRH-1 in October 2007. These projects will be in the ?CADD-directed Hit Generation' phase. We have two targets in reserve for hit generation (TDG and GNMT); these have come from our CR-UK programmes on endocrine therapy of breast cancer and epigenetics of drug resistance. All these targets are implicated in resistance to therapy in breast and prostate cancer. We will utilise the strengths of Medicinal Chemistry (Barrett), and protein crystallography/structural biology (Freemont). The programme will dovetail with CR-UK programme grant support for breast cancer biology (Coombes), drug resistance & pharmacodynamics (Brown), molecular imaging (Aboagye), and will be further supported by the IC CR-UK Medicinal Chemistry studentship programme (Barrett, Coombes) and the recently-awarded ECMC programme (Coombes/Seckl), which will provide the necessary translational underpinning as leads are taken into the clinic.

10	Dr Nicole Clarke	University of Nottingham	None	2008-04-01	2011-07-31	Identification of novel tumour suppressor pathways controlled by IRF1	Cancer cells inherently contain heterogeneity in the mutations and pathways that have been deregulated. This fact makes it important to elucidate and understand different tumour suppressor pathways in the cell that can be exploited for cancer therapy. Towards this goal we propose to study the ?tumour susceptibility gene? IRF1, which was previously shown by colleagues and I, to be a key activator of TRAIL death ligand expression in cancer cells after IFN and retinoid treatment. The induction of TRAIL by IRF1 then leads to cancer cell death via the death receptor pathway. There is still relatively little understood about the cellular pathways IRF1 controls and many of the target genes of IRF-1 remain to be identified. Two long-standing question in the field is 1) What are the tumour suppressor networks controlled by IRF1 and 2) Why do double knockout mice (p53-/-,IRF1-/-) display such profound differences in their observed tumour spectrum compared to p53-/-mice alone? We aim to answer these questions by using (Chip-chip) microarray technology to identify the direct gene targets of IRF1. We will couple these experiments to siRNA (small interfering RNA) knockdown of IRF1 to characterize its specific roles in regulating these genes. We will also characterize and then compare the epigenetic modifications occurring at IRF1 target genes in cancer cells vs normal cells. An important aspect of the proposed project is that it will allow a global view of IRF-1 tumour suppressor action and will identify where aberrant epigenetic modifications of target genes may interfere with IRF1 tumour suppressive activities. Finally, these studies will lead to a better understanding of anti-cancer networks in the cell and could provide novel avenues for cancer treatment.	Cancer Research UK	Project Award	None	None
11	Professor Helen Picton	University of Leeds	Lds Inst Genetics Health & Therapeutics	2008-09-01	2012-08-31	Biological foundation for epigenetic investigations of ART derived human oocytes and embryos	Imprinted genes are expressed predominantly or exclusively from one parental allele. This mode of regulation is uniquely sensitive to disruption, and therefore imprinted genes themselves are cellular biomarkers of epigenetic disruption, cellular stress and cancer. In assisted reproductive technology (ART) in humans, gametes and embryos are manipulated in vitro at the exact time when the complex and delicate processes of epigenetic reprogramming occur. Recent evidence suggests a range of epigenetic mutations leading to diseases such as Angelman syndrome and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have arisen in children born following assisted conception. Although some of these of imprinting defects may be caused by infertility itself, experimental evidence also indicates that ARTs can disrupt epigenetic mechanisms and alter the regulation of imprinted genes. The need to directly quantify the epigenetic consequences of ART and infertility on the health of the human preimplantation embryos is therefore becoming increasingly important. Due to the limited availability of human gametes and embryos for research and the requirement for analytical methods which are sensitive at the single oocyte/embryo level, the epigenetic processes that regulate early human development remain largely unknown. Despite these limitations we established a programme to investigate early epigenetic processes in humans and have developed appropriate tools and techniques to permit studies of oogenesis and embryogenesis. This project therefore aims to conduct a robust series of investigations of the imprinted genes in human oocytes and preimplantation embryos and to relate these observations to the epigenetic health of embryos derived following ART. This application will test the hypothesis that disruption of imprinting attributable to in vitro manipulations of human gametes and embryos will result in aberrant expression of imprinted genes in the preimplantation embryos so produced. Specifically this application will: 1) establish whether the imprinted genes and epigenetic regulators serve as biomarkers of epigenetic disruption in human blastocysts derived by conventional ART including IVF, ICSI and the in vitro maturation (IVM) of oocytes; 2) monitor allelic expression of imprinted gene transcripts in blastocysts to determine whether expression is monoallelic or otherwise; 3) use bisulphite genomic sequencing to analyse methylation imprints in human ART-derived oocytes and embryos; and 4) conduct a detailed analysis of imprinted gene expression and methylation in a cohort of IVM blastocysts. The data generated will significantly advance our knowledge of the mechanism(s) behind ART-induced imprinting defects in human oocytes and embryos and will help us understand how to alleviate these problems in the future.

12	Professor Bryan Turner	University of Birmingham	None	2008-10-01	2012-03-31	Epigenetic mechanisms in development and cancer	The histones of the nucleosome core particle are subject to various enzyme-catalyzed modifications, mostly to their N-terminal tails. These modifications, directly or indirectly, alter DNA packaging and can thereby regulate gene expression. The enzymes that modify histones can be activated or inhibited by metabolic and environmental variables. Some depend on common metabolites such as NAD, while others are inhibited by common environmental or dietary components, such as short chain fatty acids. The nucleosome is a sensor through which environmental and metabolic changes influence genomic function. In the present research we ask whether environmentally-induced changes in histone modification can induce long-term, heritable changes in patterns of gene expression. Cancer is known to be induced by a variety of environmental toxins, generally thought to operate by causing genetic mutations, ie. changes in DNA. We will ask whether environmental variables can also cause heritable changes in expression of key genes (oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes) by altering histone modifications, providing an epigenetic route to cancer initiation or progression.. As model systems to study the induction of histone modifications and their heritability, we will use mouse embryos grown in culture and mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. We will focus on mechanisms by which genes on one X chromosome are heritably inactivated during differentiation of female ES cells. We will use X inactivation to explore the possible link between histone modifications catalyzed by polycomb group proteins and DNA methylation, often aberrant on numerous genes in cancer. To define patterns of histone modification across selected genes we will use chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), assaying precipitated DNA either by Real Time Quantitative PCR for analysis of key genes or with DNA microarrays to provide genome-wide assay of levels of DNA methylation, histone modification and enzyme distribution during ES cell differentiation. Using a novel technique that allows ChIP data to be obtained from as few as 100 cells (CChIP), we are able to study epigenetic changes in primary cells. We will follow environmentally-induced changes in defined cell populations (eg Inner Cell Mass, trophectoderm) from the developing embryo and in small clusters of cells excised from tissue sections by laser capture. In collaborative work, we will use the latter approach us to look for epigenetic changes in cells of defined type, either cancerous or normal, from sections taken from colon cancers at different stages of development and from premalignant tissue.

Background and relevance to cancer: The transatlantic prostate group has followed up a cohort of 2,333 clinically localised conservatively treated prostate cancer for over 10 years, with multiple clinical and pathological parameters, to try and determine which cases need to be selected for radical therapy. However in 60% of cases, behaviour of the tumour cannot be predicted. The cohort consisted of 55% transurethral (TURP) specimens which have been analysed for multiple biomarkers. 1039 biopsy specimens remain uncollected or analysed. Aims of research: Collection of prostatic biopsies from the series, tissue micro array (TMA) and biomarker analysis to assess candidate markers which can predict cancer behaviour. Any residual tissue will be used for RNA and epigenetic studies. Plan of research: Year 1; A pilot collection of tissue will proceed to create a TMA from the biopsy specimens. Collected cases will be examined to identify cancer. Initial immunochemistry for p63/AMACR will confirm whether the TMA tissue can be used for research and the amount of cancer in the tissue sampled. Remaining tissue from these cases will be used for later possible epigenetic studies and RNA extraction though this will not form part of the revised grant. This 'proof of principle' in the first year will show viability of both parts of the project. Year 2; Collection of remainder of tissue and TMA construction with early biomarker analysis. Year 3; Biomarker analysis, including FISH and immunochemistry with interpretation and statistical analysis. Return of blocks.	Cancer Research UK	Project Award	None	None

Epigenetics describes the regulation of gene expression, chromosome stability, genomic imprinting, and stem cell fate through inherited and acquired modifications of DNA, histones and proteins. Alterations in epigenetic signaling are involved in major diseases including cancer, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. A dissection of the molecular mechanisms of epigenetic signaling will be facilitated by the widespread availability of small molecule chemical probes, that are selective for spec ific components of the epigenetic machinery. We aim to generate 25 chemical probes of pre-defined potency, selectivity and cellular activity. They will be directed against 3 important epigenetic protein families, comprising histone lysine demethylases, Bromo and Tudor domains. These probes will be made freely available to the scientific community. The team comprises internationally leading researchers from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), The National Chemical Genomics Centre (NCGC) and the Univers ity of Oxford.

CTCF, a candidate tumour-suppressor gene, has emerged as a main player in controlling chromatin structure and function. CTCF, for CCCTC-binding factor, is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein highly conserved from Drosophila to human and identified as the vertebrate insulator protein. These insulators are DNA elements thought to partition the genome into independently regulated domains. The molecular basis of insulation seems to be linked to several long-range physical interactions between different portions of the chromatin fibre. By reporting co-localisation between CTCF and the cohesin complex, several studies may have lifted the veil on the mechanism mediating CTCF insulator function. Cohesin is a large ring-shaped protein complex thought to trap pairs of replicated chromosomes, known as sister chromatids, for segregation during the nuclear-division phase of the cell cycle. If cohesin rings can hold two sister chromatids, they might also be able to link a CTCF-binding site to other sequences or to another CTCF binding sites, some distance away along the chromosome. Moreover, without a doubt, the discovery of CTCF-cohesin interaction has not only provided a new perception on insulation, but also opened new perspectives about CTCF other multiple functions. At the chicken lysozyme locus, CTCF is associated with silencing. Our recent studies established that CTCF recruits cohesin at this silencer and that full transcriptional activation of this gene in macrophage correlates with a transcription dependent loss of CTCF/cohesin. By analysing available databases, we identified new CTCF binding sites at the vicinity of key regulators of myeloid differentiation as well as LPS-inducible genes and established cohesin co-localisation with CTCF at these binding sites. We want to understand how the presence of CTCF/cohesin affects the expression of these genes and whether this, in turn, affects the differentiation and the function of granulocytes and macrophages. Using myeloid cell lines and in vitro differentiation of mouse primary macrophages, we plan to analyse CTCF/cohesin interaction with the selected binding sites and the effect of aberrant expression of both protein on the expression of these genes, during myeloid differentiation. With emerging evidence pointed to the role of CTCF deregulation in the epigenetic imbalance in cancer, we also want to investigate the link between CTCF and DNA methylation in our system.

Together, DNA and histone marks form an epigenetic code that holds the clues to understanding cell differentiation and lineage specification in normal development, as well as the disease states of genomic imprinting, Rett syndrome and cancer. Somatic cell nuclear transfer experiments have demonstrated that the epigenetic memory of heritable DNA methylation and chromatin states in differentiated cells is not easily erased in order to restore developmental potential, and that incorrect nuclear reprogramming leads to developmental failure. This has refocused attention on understanding the natural nuclear reprogramming process that with each new generation reinstates totipotency in the fertilised zygote. Demethylation of DNA is thought to be necessary for the activation of essential developmental genes. Rapid DNA demethylation of the mouse male pronucleus with passive DNA demethylation of the female genome in subsequent cell divisions was taken to indicate that nuclear reprogramming constitutes the global removal of epigenetic marks. This striking pronuclear asymmetry and demethylation dynamics is not conserved in other mammals, however, an observation at odds with the evolutionary conserved developmental context. Hypothesising that sperm chromatin variability in protamines, histones, variants and epigenetic modifications can explain these differences, we will investigate elements of somatic and zygotic chromatin structure that delimit the nuclear reprogramming process and determine its epigenetic outcome.

18	Dr Ooi	Columbia University	None	2010-08-09	2015-08-08	Uncovering signals regulating epigenetic establishment and maintenance in mammals	Epigenetic processes regulate the transmission of gene transcription states during cellular differentiation, involved in the maintenance of pluripotency and differentiation. Aberrant gene expression is responsible for most noninfectious diseases and disease-associated epigenetic changes strongly correlate with a number of age-related human disorders, such as cancer, autoimmune disease and complex psychiatric disorders. How epigenetic states are established and maintained remains poorly defined and elucidating the mechanisms will help in biomarker development for screening purposes, as well as the identification of drug targets for disease treatment. The objectives outlined in this proposal will further define mechanisms involved in both the establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation. To identify regulators of maintenance methylation, I will generate an ES cell line carrying a GFP reporter targeting the Avy agouti locus for use in an RNAi screen. A second, independent RNAi screen will identify candidate germ cell-specific factors involved in DNA methylation establishment, using retroviral infection of ES cells. Objectives 3 and 4 of this proposal will follow up on my previous findings, showing that a regulator of DNA methylation establishment, Dnmt3L, binds the N terminus of the nucleosomal protein histone H3. This binding is inhibited by methylation at lysine 4 (H3K4), suggesting that factors affecting H3K4 methylation are involved in DNA methylation establishment. To test this, I will generate mice carrying a point mutation in the Dnmt3L gene, preventing the protein from binding histone H3. These mice will provide insight into the general importance of histone recognition by Dnmt3L. I also will examine H3K4 methylation status at DNA methylation target loci in mouse germ cells using a combination of mini-ChIP and IF-FISH. Analysis of factors known to affect H3K4 methylation will highlight functionally important factors for future study by mouse genetics.

We aim to: (1) maximise the potential of the ERC cohorts to enable the definition of developmental influences on major childhood and adult disorders, and examine hypotheses relating to prenatal/postnatal mismatch, epigenetic processes and economic consequences; and (2) conduct intervention studies in young women to improve their health and that of their children. Research proposals: Within the SWS and our other mother-offspring cohorts we shall examine the hypothesis that maternal and lifestyle influences from before conception, and mismatches between the fetal/infant and later childhood environment, have detrimental effects on body composition, cardiovascular structure and function, respiratory disease and atopy, and cognition.

Our data resources spanning the lifecourse provide opportunities for comprehensive mechanistic and behavioural insights into chronic diseases and markers at different stages of life. Moreover, in an international collaboration we are defining the economic consequences of a poor start to life, which will inform public health policy and assess the potential impact of focused interventions. Finally, our work has led to four interventions to improve the diets and health behaviours of young women. Three of these target women in pregnancy.

Impact: Our work contributes to three current MRC research priorities: clinical and public health research, ageing-related research, and biomarkers. The work has a strong clinical and public health focus, our lifecourse approach increases understanding of ageing, and our work on epigenetic processes aims to identify biomarkers that assist in the characterisation of new interventions to improve public health. Our cohort studies will provide evidence as to whether mismatches between the maternal, infant and childhood environments are associated with cardiovascular risk, impaired respiratory health, cognitive development, and obesity. Our intervention studies will provide translational data on the benefits of better nutrition of young women, and have the potential to improve the health of women and children now, and that of future generations.

The work has a strong clinical and public health focus, our lifecourse approach increases understanding of ageing, and our work on epigenetic processes aims to identify biomarkers that assist in the characterisation of new interventions to improve public health. Our cohort studies will provide evidence as to whether mismatches between the maternal, infant and childhood environments are associated with cardiovascular risk, impaired respiratory health, cognitive development, and obesity. Our intervention studies will provide translational data on the benefits of better nutrition of young women, and have the potential to improve the health of women and children now, and that of future generations.

21	Professor Peter Adams	University of Glasgow	Institute of Cancer Studies	2012-01-04	2015-01-03	Tumor suppression by chromatin regulators.	Oncogene-induced cellular senescence (OIS) is a permanent cell growth arrest caused by an activated oncogene in a primary untransformed cell. OIS is a potent tumor suppression mechanism. Senescence depends on profound changes in chromatin structure. Two chromatin regulatory complexes implicated in control of senescence are the HIRA/UBN1/CABIN1/ASF1a (HUCA) histone chaperone complex and the Brg1/Snf5 chromatin-remodeling complex. HUCA is a histone chaperone that deposits the histone variant, histone H3.3, at transcription start sites and other gene regulatory sites. Since histone H3.3-containing nucleosomes are unstable, this promotes transcription activation. The Brg1/Snf5 complex reshapes chromatin in an ATP-dependent manner, and this also frequently results in transcription activation. Consistent with a role in senescence, the Brg1/Snf5 complex has potent tumor suppressor activity in humans and mouse models. However, the relationship between HUCA and Brg1/Snf5 as regulators of gene transcription and senescence is unknown. Recently, through unbiased, whole-genome ChIP coupled to massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) we discovered a striking overlap between HUCA and Brg1/Snf5 across the human genome. Accordingly, we hypothesize that Brg1/Snf5 and HUCA are intimately associated as regulators of chromatin structure and function. In particular, we hypothesize that HUCA and Brg1/Snf5 collaborate to regulate the onset of cell senescence. We will test this hypothesis as follows: Aim 1. Compare physical and functional overlap of HUCA and Brg1/Snf5 complexes in proliferating and senescent cells. Aim 2. Investigate physical and mechanistic interactions between HUCA and Brg1/Snf5 in vitro. Aim 3. Investigate functional and mechanistic interactions between HUCA and Brg1/Snf5 in vivo.

A significant proportion of the mutations, chromosomal rearrangements and epigenetic changes associated with human genetic disease and cancer are thought to be generated by stochastic and DNA damage-induced replication errors. Furthermore, many chemotherapeutic drugs are specifically toxic to replicating cells, a feature that imparts therapeutic index but which also limits their utility due to side effects on rapidly dividing normal cells. The DNA Damage Response (DDR) pathways act to suppress genetic change in the face of endogenous and exogenous replicative stress. It has become evident that the majority of cancer cells are defective in one or more DDRs. Some DDRs, such as the intra-S phase checkpoint, are proposed to be mutated in order for a pre-cancerous cell to overcome the barrier to carcinogenesis imposed by oncogene-induced senescence. Mutations in other DDRs are proposed to be selected for because they allow increased genome stability, thus promoting tumour development and evolution. My long-term aim is to provide detailed mechanistic information that will assist the development of rational ?synthetic lethality? therapies in order to target cancers with specific changes or combinations of changes in DDR proteins and pathways, as well as to help identify potential new targets for drug development. Therefore, in this program I propose to study the relationship between DNA replication and the DDR to investigate how these pathways contribute to maintaining genome stability. Specifically, I will use a model eukaryote, S. pombe, to help to elucidate and understand how the intra-S phase checkpoint regulates DNA metabolism to maintain replication forks in a stable conformation. I will also explore the mechanisms and consequences of replication fork restart, which is necessary when these stabilisation pathways fail. I hypothesise that a relatively under-explored protein, TopBP1, plays important roles in coordinating the transitions made by the replication and repair apparatus during fork arrest and restart by virtue of its ability to act as a multi-functional phospho-protein binding scaffold: TopBP1 can respond to a range of regulatory phosphorylation events and thus act as a ?node? coordinating signalling pathways by integrating disparate phosphorylation events. I will therefore continue my exploration of TopBP1 functions in yeast and higher eukaryotes.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	2146190.0	GBP

We showed that Epstein-Barr virus EBNA3A and EBNA3C act as oncoproteins but EBNA3B behaves as a tumour suppressor, the first described in a tumour virus. Our reverse genetic analysis revealed that EBNA3A, 3B and 3C together regulate the expression of specific host genes in B cells, often repressing transcription. This repression involves recruitment of polycomb group (PcG) proteins and the epigenetic mark of repression H3K27me3. Target genes include those encoding the inhibitor of proliferation p16INK4a and pro-apoptotic factor BIM, both of which are repressed in a similar manner in stem cell maintenance and are often silenced in cancer. We have thus proposed that EBV epigenetically reprograms B cells in viral persistence and in B cell lymphomas. The regulation of PcG-mediated repression linked to EBV-associated cancers gives an exceptional opportunity to investigate, in a physiological context, principles of epigenetic silencing. These are likely to have wide application to cancer biology and epigenetic gene regulation by persistent microorganisms. Our key goals are: Detailed biochemical mechanisms for interactions between the EBNA3s and cellular factors responsible for this EBV-mediated reprogramming. Comprehensive genome-wide analyses establishing the extent of EBV-induced reprogramming via the PcG system and the identities of all genes specifically targeted by EBNA3s. To use EBNA3 proteins as tools to understand poorly defined processes in PcG-mediated repression such as the sequence of events in recruitment of complexes to specific target genes. To use our animal model to determine how these processes contribute to EBV persistence, B cell lymphomagenesis and tumour immunosurveillance.

Two key mechanisms known to regulate the functional state of chromatin in mammals are the methylation of DNA and the post-translational modification of histone proteins. Due to the large number of possible modifications, epigenetic information can be stored in chromatin modification patterns. Chromatin modifications have been shown to regulate all DNA-associated processes, such as transcription, replication, and DNA repair, and play an important role in cell proliferation and differentiation. These functions are intimately linked to the faithful interpretation and inheritance of genetic information and the memory of a cell’s identity. Deregulation of these modifications and their modifying enzymes are implicated in many types of diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders. Many chromatin-regulating factors have been identified that recognise methylated DNA or modified histones. Such effector molecules use a range of different binding domains in order to establish and orchestrate biological events. Since chromatin is a large macromolecular assembly, modifications most likely act in a concerted manner. However, it is still unclear how the information contained in combinatorial modification patterns on the DNA and histones is interpreted. Our aim is to understand how combinations of DNA and histone modifications regulate the activity of chromatin. We employ the tools of chemical biology, biochemistry and proteomics in conjunction with tissue culture and genomic technologies in order to study proteins that can recognise DNA and histone modification patterns in the context of chromatin. We have developed a technique called SILAC nucleosome affinity purification that allows us to identify proteins that bind DNA or histone modifications on in vitro assembled nucleosomes using high-resolution mass spectrometry. We will use this technique for identifying new factors that integrate information contained in multiple chromatin modifications on nucleosomes and chromatin, and for understanding how they operate at the molecular level. We are particularly interested in the molecular mechanisms that underlie epigenetic gene regulation events during DNA replication, tumour formation and differentiation processes. Our research will help elucidate how chromatin modifications regulate cellular processes and how deregulation of normal chromatin function leads to diseases. Our ultimate goal is to identify the critical factors and to understand their molecular and cellular functions in order to develop drugs for epigenetic therapies against diseases such as cancer.

25	Professor Anne Ferguson-Smith	University of Cambridge	Genetics	2012-05-15	2018-02-28	Genomic imprinting and the epigenetic control of developmental processes	Genomic imprinting is an epigenetically regulated process causing genes to be expressed according to their parental origin. Genetics studies have shown that genomic imprinting occurs at dosage-sensitive genes and regulates important developmental processes during the lifetime of the mammal. In human, altered imprinted gene expression is associated with growth, metabolic and neurological disorders, and cancer. Imprinting is regulated by DNA methylation, an epigenetic modification that differentially marks the two parental chromosomes influencing long range cis-acting control of the activity and repression of protein-coding and small and large regulatory non-coding RNAs. Over the past 20 years, genomic imprinting has emerged as a useful paradigm contributing to our understanding of the roles of epigenetic modifications in the regulation of gene activity and repression, and into wider mechanisms underlying the epigenetic control of genome function in development, health and disease. Recently we have shown in a developmental model of postnatal neurogenesis, selective absence of imprinting occurs to control gene dosage in the stem cell niche and this is required to maintain the postnatal stem cell pool and the synthesis of new neurons. This suggests that dosage control by imprinting may be an epigenetically modulatable process that can adapt to particular environmental requirements during development. Understanding epigenetic modulation in response to environmental signals is a major challenge in biomedical research. The proposed research aims to focus on mechanisms and developmental pathways associated with this. Addressing these aims has timely general implications for understanding the epigenetic regulation of the stem cell niche and for the characterization of factors and pathways that influence the relationship between stem cells and their environment contributing to our understanding of adult onset diseases, neuronal plasticity, aging and cancer.

26	Dr Maria Blasco	FUNDACION CENTRO NACIONAL DE INVESTIGACIONES ONCOLOGICAS CARLOS III	None	2009-05-01	2014-05-01	FROM TELOMERE CHROMATIN TO STEM CELL BIOLOGY	Telomeres are ribonucleoprotein complexes at the ends of chromosomes that are essential for chromosome protection and genomic stability. Telomeres consist of tandem TTAGGG repeats bound to a 6-protein complex known as shelterin. More recently, telomeres have been also shown to contain long non-coding telomeric RNAs (TelRNAs or TERRAs), which are associated to the telomeric chromatin and have been proposed to be potential regulators of telomerase activity and telomere length. In addition, telomeric chromatin is enriched in epigenetic marks characteristic of constitutive heterochromatin, such as histone trimethylation (H3K9 and H4K20 tri-methylation) and DNA hypermethylation, which act as negative regulators of telomere length. Telomere length defects are associated to both cancer and aging processes, and have been recently shown to have a profound effect on stem cell behaviour. Here, we propose to determine the role of both genetic and epigenetic telomere regulators in cancer and aging by generating new mouse models. Finally, we will study the role of these factors in stem cell biology.	European Research Council	Advanced Grant	2000000.0	EUR
27	Dr Manel Esteller Badosa	Fundació Privada Institut D'investigació Biomèdica De Bellvitge	None	2011-04-01	2016-04-01	Epigenetic Disruption of Non-Coding RNAs in Human Cancer	In recent years, my laboratory, as well as others, have established the observation that epigenetic disruption, particularly in the DNA methylation and histone modification patterns, contributes to the initiation and progression of human tumors (Esteller, Nat Rev Genet 2007; Esteller, N Engl J Med 2008; Esteller, Nat Rev Biotech, In Press, 2010). Even more recently, it has been recognized that microRNAs, small non-coding RNAs that are thought to regulate gene expression by sequence-specific base pairing in mRNA targets, also play a key role in the biology of the cell, and that they can also have an impact in the development of many diseases, including cancer (le Sage and Agami, 2006; Blenkiron and Miska, 2007). However, there is little understanding about epigenetic modifications that might regulate the activity of microRNAs and other non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs), transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs), small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), long interspersed ncRNAs (lincRNAs), promoter-associated RNAs (PASRs and PALRs) and terminator-associated sRNAs (TASRs) (Calin et al., 2007; Mercer, et al., 2009; Ghildiyal & Zamore, 2009; Jacquier, 2009). Our ignorance in this respect is even more significant if we consider these questions in the domain of cancer. Making best use of our expertise in several of these fields, my group will tackle the study of the epigenetic modifications that regulate ncRNA expression and how the DNA methylation and histone modifications profiles of these loci might become distorted in human cancer. These findings could have profound consequences not only in the understading of tumor biology, but in the design of better molecular staging, diagnosis and treatments of human malignancies.

Gadd45a is activated by the tumor suppressor gene p53, which is mutated in >50% of human tumors. We found that Gadd45a is a negative regulator of T cell proliferation, and that lack of Gadd45a in mice leads to development of an autoimmune disease similar to systemic lupus erythematosus. The molecular mechanisms that cause autoimmunity are still poorly understood. T cells from Gadd45a-null mice show constitutive p38 activation and hyperproliferative responses, resulting in autoimmunity. Recent evidence suggests that activation of p38 signaling is involved in autoimmune development and tumor suppression. Gadd45a negatively regulates p38 activity in T cells by preventing phosphorylation on Tyr323. Inhibition of Tyr323p38 phosphorylation is a potential therapeutic target in several types of leukemia and autoimmune diseases, including lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. The main goals of this project are a) to study the in vivo function of the Gadd45 family and p38 in tumor suppression and autoimmunity, and b) to analyze their molecular mechanisms to identify targets for disease treatment. We will dissect the signaling pathways involved in development of autoimmunity and cancer using a multidisciplinary approach that combines mouse genetic, human epigenetic, biochemical, molecular biological and immunological techniques. Our project involves the generation of murine models deficient in each member of the Gadd45 family (Gadd45a, Gadd45b, Gadd45g), as well as double- and triple-knockout mice, development of a knock-in model for p38a, in vivo and in vitro analysis of T cell activation, proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation, epigenetic studies of potential targets, and finally, validation of these results in autoimmune disease and cancer patients. The results of this project will help identify new therapeutic targets for autoimmune diseases and/or cancer.	European Research Council	Starting Grant	1755805.0	EUR

However, recent high throughput approach studies indicate that the impact of TE-associated activities was seriously underestimated. The first objective is to investigate the impact of TE-derived activities on the human genome in general and on disease mechanisms in particular, based on the central premise that some of these activities are stress-induced. To model how a vertebrate-specific transposon responds to stress signals in human cells, I will study molecular interactions of the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon with host cellular mechanisms to understand how stress-signalling and response triggers transposon activation. My second aim is to decipher the relationship between stress-induced activation of endogenous TEs and TE-derived regulatory sequences and human disease. I aim at investigating conditions and the consequences of activation of a particular copy of the MERmaid transposon located in the Sin3B transcriptional corepressor, frequently observed in cancer. The impact of global epigenetic remodelling will be investigated in the model of a complete (induced pluripotency) and partial (trans-differentiation) epigenetic reprogramming. In parallel, I aim at translating experience accumulated in TE research to cutting-edge technologies. First, the SB transposon will be adopted as a safe, therapeutic vector to treat age-dependent blindness (AMD). Second, a mutagenic SB vector will be used in a forward genetic screen to decipher a genetic network that protects against hormone-induced mammary cancer. The anticipated output of my research programme is a refined understanding of the consequences of environmental stress on our genome mediated by TE-derived sequences. The project is expected to provide an effective bridge between basic research and clinical- as well as technological translation of a novel gene transfer technology.

The study of childhood cancer and associated syndromes, such as those that result in global or regional overgrowth, has resulted in important insights into basic biological processes and substantial clinical benefits. Through the Factors Associated with Childhood Tumours (FACT) and Childhood Overgrowth Genetics (COG) studies, we recruit and phenotype families with childhood cancer and/or overgrowth and have over 6000 participants. We have already used these unique studies to identify common and rare genetic and epigenetic susceptibility factors for these conditions. However, these only account for a minority of children. The proposed research will extend our research and will address three key questions: 1. What are the genetic and epigenetic factors that predispose to childhood cancer and/or overgrowth conditions? 2. What are the distinctive somatic characteristics of cancers that arise in children with genetic or epigenetic susceptibility conditions? 3. How can we translate these findings for clinical benefit? We will employ genome-wide exomic, genomic and methylation analyses to discover new predisposition factors, together with targeted replication and large-scale characterisation analyses to define prevalence, penetrance, associated clinical features, the spectrum of pathogenic mutations and genotype-phenotype associations. The tumour analyses will yield insights into tumourigenesis and can provide unique information about the timing and order of molecular events i n tumours, as the predisposing mutation is clearly the initiating/first event. We will integrate these data to define the clinically relevant information required for clinical translation of new genes/epigenetic defects and to produce diagnostic, management and testing protocols for use in clinical practice.

32	Professor Robert Brown	Imperial College London	None	2010-03-01	2012-05-31	Prognostic value of epigenetic variability in somatic cells from ovarian cancer patients in SCOTROC1 (PESOS)	Recent studies have shown significant DNA methylation variation in non-cancerous cells across unrelated individuals which may be associated with cancer risk. Examples include, methylation of an intragenic element within the ATM gene in bilateral breast cancer cases and transgenerational inheritance of DNA methylation at cancer susceptibility loci, such as MLH1, in HNPCC patients. We hypothesise that inter-individual DNA methylation variation may provide prognostic value in determining clinical outcome of cancer patients. We propose to test this by examining DNA methylation by bisulphite pyrosequencing and differential methylation hybridisation in peripheral blood cells previously collected from over 950 patients enrolled in the SCOTROC1 trial (Phase III comparison of paclitaxel-carboplatin versus docetaxel-carboplatin as primary chemotherapy for stage Ic-IV epithelial ovarian cancer). We will investigate three groups of targets: (1) methylation variable intragenic repetitive elements across the ATM gene (2) identified variable regions within candidate genes such as MLH1, ESR1, PGR, (3) CpG island loci that are candidate germline epimutations, such as MLH1, MSH2 and IGF2 imprinting region. Association between methylation and response, progression-free and overall survival will be sought. In addition, novel methylation patterns will be identified using a customised microarray of 60K loci in a sub-set of patients compared to age-matched controls.

The results of recent human and animal studies have provided strong evidence for the epigenetic effects of a dietary deficiency of methyl donors on cancer risk and some other common diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying the links between epigenetic alterations and disease remain elusive. Given that the development of cancer is a multistep process of mutation accumulation, it is plausible that the reported long-term changes in the pattern of DNA methylation following dietary restriction may destabilise the genome. Relevance to cancer. The proposed research aims to establish the long-term epigenetic effects of a folate-deficient diet on genome stability, patterns of DNA methylation and gene expression in treated mice and their offspring, and could elucidate the unknown mechanisms underlying such changes. An in depth analysis of the mechanisms underlying the links between environmentally-induced epigenetic changes and disease could substantially improve the identification of the determinants of cancer. A better understanding of the pattern of transmission of epigenetic changes should provide experimentally based estimates of the delayed epigenetic effects of exposure to a broad range of environmental factors, of direct relevance to cancer research. This work could ultimately improve early diagnostic testing for aberrant DNA methylation that can lead to cancer. Aims: (i) to establish whether a folate-deficient diet results in long-term changes in mutation rate in treated mice and their offspring; (ii) to establish whether a folate-deficient diet can alter the pattern of DNA methylation in treated mice and their offspring; (iii) to establish whether a folate-deficient diet affects gene expression in treated mice and their offspring. Plan of research. Male mice will be maintained for 12 weeks on a folate-deficient diet. To establish the effects of diet on mutation induction and transgenerational instability, the frequency of mutation at an expanded simple tandem repeat (ESTR) locus will be determined in the treated mice 0-12 weeks after dietary exposure and in their offspring. Using the MeDIP assay, the methylation status of mouse gene promoters will be established. To investigate whether epigenetic methylation changes are heritable, the patterns of DNA methylation will also be assessed in the offspring of treated mice. Using microarrays, the expression profiles of the same control and treated animals will also be analysed, addressing the following questions: (i) do diet-related alterations in the epigenetic landscape affect the expression profiles of methyl-deficient animals? (ii) do paternal dietary deficiencies affect gene expression in their offspring?	Cancer Research UK	Project Award	None	None
35	Professor Alastair Sutcliffe	University College London	None	2011-05-01	2013-04-30	Are children born after assisted reproduction at increased risk of cancer? A population based linkage study	BACKGROUND: The number of children born after Assisted Reproduction Technologies (ART) is rising year on year (0.5% of UK births in 1992, rising to 1.8% in 2007). There are over 1 million such children under 14 years of age in Europe and over 3.5 million worldwide. It is not known if these growing numbers of children are at higher risk of cancer. However there are reasons why a higher risk of childhood cancer may exist in this group. These include epigenetic aberrations which have recently been found in human ART embryos, cord blood and placenta. An internationally unique opportunity has arisen to investigate this rare outcome. A change in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) Act effective from April 2010 will allow records from the registry database (recording all births after ART since 1992) to be used for research purposes (with due caveats). AIMS: To establish: a) If there is a higher risk of cancer in children (aged 0-14 years inclusive) born after assisted reproduction than in the general population of British children. b) If different ART methods give rise to differing childhood cancer risk METHODS: This study will link 149,000 children recorded on the HFEA registry to the National Childhood Cancer Registry (which is the largest childhood cancer registry worldwide and records all childhood cancers occurring in the UK). The linkage will be carried out within the HFEA. The number of cases in the cohort will be compared with the number expected, based on annual age-specific UK incidence rates for childhood cancer 1992-2008. This study already has ethical approval/peer review (including from the NIGB). RESULTS: The results of this research will be used to inform ART stakeholders of this key ART outcome. Stakeholders include couples wishing to undergo ART, families who have used ART, the general public & fertility treatment teams. Should a higher risk of any site specific cancer be found, this will need further investigation to determine if this is related to any component of ART treatment (with a view to modifying practice). A lower risk or nil effect will be a useful population health message relevant to this growing proportion of the nation's children and their families, some of whom have requested this study.

Deregulation of the p14ARF gene has been associated with breast cancer development, but the molecular events underlying these processes are not well understood. Our recent studies demonstrated that p14ARF gene is regulated by a multifunctional 11 Zn-finger transcription factor, CTCF, and a post-translational modification, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) of CTCF. CTCF normally activates p14ARF and this activation relies on the presence of both, CTCF and the PARylation enzyme-1, PARP-1, at the CTCF binding site (CTS) identified within the p14ARF promoter. The aim of the proposed investigation is to test two hypotheses: 1. There is a causal link between CTCF and PARP-1 association at the p14ARF CTS, defective CTCF (and possibly PARP-1) PARylation and p14ARF deregulation. 2. CTCF and PARP-1 act as a “rheostat” regulating changes in epigenetic configuration at the p14ARF CTS. To achieve this Aim, we will study the following four Objectives: Objective 1 Analysis of the expression of p14ARF mRNA and the status of CTCF and PARP-1 in the experimental cell models. Objective 2 Analysis of the role of CTCF and PARP-1 in the establishment of the epigenetic states at the p14ARF CTS. Objective 3 Analysis of p14ARF mRNA levels and their correlation with epigenetic states at the p14ARF CTS in normal and tumour breast tissues. Objective 4 Is the p14ARF CTS a “master” p14ARF regulatory element? Analysis of the additional CTSs within the INK/ARF locus and their contribution to the regulation of p14ARF. We will use model cell lines with different levels of p14ARF mRNA expression to assess the role of CTCF and PARP-1 in the regulation of the epigenetic states at the CTS within the p14ARF promoter and also at other CTSs in the INK/ARF locus. Our observations will then be further validated using breast tumour tissues. We will employ a wide range of methods including RT-QPCR, QPCR, ChIP, re-ChIP, bisulfite sequencing, pyrosequencing, Western, gel retardation, methylation interference and various cell/tissue culture techniques. The results obtained will be used to better understand the molecular mechanisms of p14ARF regulation by CTCF and PARP-1. Thus, elucidation of the role of epigenetic alterations in p14ARF can provide an insight into the nature of predisposition to and early stages of breast tumourigenesis. These results may also be valuable for design of anti-cancer treatment because epigenetic changes can potentially be reversed with the right therapies.

In common with other malignancies, loss of gene function resulting from DNA hypermethylation has been shown in NB. To date however, other mechanisms such as histone methylation, and their gene targets have not been characterised. As several novel small molecule drugs capable of specifically targeting components of the repressive epigenetic machinery are now emerging, it is vital to define the full spectrum of repressive marks in NB cells together with the genes they affect. Drug induced removal of such epigenetic blocks may represent a new therapeutic option for cancer. AIMS & OBJECTIVES: This study will evaluate epigenetic inhibitors for their therapeutic potential on NB cells. In particular, we will compare drug treatments with highest efficacy against cells representative of poor prognosis NB, in parallel with transcriptomic and epigenetic profiling. We will therefore determine which genes/pathways and epigenetic marks are integral to development and maintenance of neuroblastoma. METHODS: This study assess cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis together with array-based gene expression and epigenetic analyses. HOW THE RESULTS OF THIS RESEARCH WILL BE USED: By determining which genes and epigenetic marks are important to NB aetiology, and which epigenetic inhibitors, or combinations thereof, are optimal for reactivating silenced genes, we will evaluate potential novel therapies for NB.

However, prostate cancer is difficult to manage clinically, due to a poor current understanding of what dictates its highly variable natural history, and of what underlies the development of castration-resistant disease. The aetiology of this disease and in particular the reasons for ethnic differences in incidence are not understood. There is an urgent requirement to execute a large-scale and highly integrated research programme that will achieve breakthrough advances in understanding the molecular and cellular basis of this disease, including the identification of new biomarkers and drug targets. Specific Aims of Research: We [International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC)-Prostate Cancer] are a group of French, Canadian, US, Asian, and UK investigators. This is an application to fund the UK, Asian, and US members of the consortium. The proposed project consists of a Pilot Study and a Full Study. The aim of the Pilot Study is to set up and test a multi-centre structure that complies with ICGC standards. The aim of the Full Study is to determine the full genome DNA sequence for 250 prostate specimens, mostly cancers. The overall scientific aims are: (i) to understand molecular basis of the clinical heterogeneity of prostate cancer; (ii) to understand the large variation in incidences that occur in different populations and ethnic groups; (iii) to understand the molecular basis of development of castration-resistant and metastatic disease; (iv) to determine whether driving genetic alterations are unique to cancer epithelium or may also occur in morphological ?normal' epithelium and stroma; and (v) to subsequently collect genome wide transcriptomics and epigenetic data to provide integrated models of cancer development. Outline Plan of Research: To achieve these aims the consortium will bring together several unique collections of frozen prostate cancers and prepare DNA and RNA according to common SOPs. Comparison of genomic DNA sequence of prostate cancers will be made (i) from low (Asian) and high risk (US, European) populations (ii) from patients with low, intermediate and high risks of cancer progression, (iii) from patients with localised disease and those having castration resistant and metastatic disease. Separate regions of single prostates will also be compared including cancer, apparently ?normal epithelium' and stroma. Existing infrastructure, including that set up by the NCRI Prostate Cancer Collaboratives, will be used to translate discoveries from this programme into new management strategies for prostate cancer.

The full impact of vaccination against high-risk human papillomavirus (HRHPV) will not be seen for ~30 years and there will be no benefits for women who are already HRHPV positive. We will investigate key events in the development of cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) following HRHPV infection. We will study mechanisms of viral persistence, causes of deregulated viral transcription in proliferating (basal) epithelium and the significance of common host genomic changes induced by over-expressed HRHPV oncogenes. Aims/Objectives: (i) Test the value of oncostatin M receptor (OSMR) as a therapeutic target in cervical SCC. OSMR is one of the most frequently over-expressed genes in cervical SCC and predicts adverse overall survival, independent of disease stage. As a cell surface molecule, OSMR is a strong candidate for antibody-mediated inhibition, a strategy that has had a major impact on HER2-positive breast cancers. (ii) Discover genes on chromosome 3 that mediate the transition from cervical pre-cancer to malignancy. (iii) Identify viral genetic and/or epigenetic changes that determine high levels of HRHPV transcription in basal cervical epithelium. (iv) Define the contribution of host genes to cell selection in the early stages of neoplastic progression associated with integrated HRHPV. We will definitively test whether HRHPV deregulates host genes at or near the integration site (i.e. insertional mutagenesis). (v) Test whether the contribution of steroid hormones to cervical carcinogenesis depends on HRHPV physical state (episomal vs. integrated) and/or epigenetic modifications to viral chromatin. (vi) Study the significance of down-regulated anti-viral receptors TLR3 and RIG-I in HRHPV persistence. We recently found that both molecules are under-expressed in persistent HPV16 infection, due to an effect of one or more viral gene product(s). Methods: We will use archival clinical specimens, plus the unique W12 system, which accurately models key viral and host events in cervical carcinogenesis. Major resources will be a panel of 24 isogenic W12 clones, each with HPV16 integrated at a different genomic site, plus a long-term W12 culture series in which in vitro carcinogenesis is associated with transcriptional deregulation of viral episomes not integrants. Use of Research: The work will address important clinical needs, including: improved identification of progressive cervical pre-cancers and early-stage SCCs; greater understanding of the effects and risks of anti-HRHPV therapies currently in use or development; and generation of new therapeutic strategies that target viral oncogenes or significant host factors.

Understanding mechanisms of drug resistance, and how they emerge, will be important for novel strategies to improve the treatment of cancer patients. Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, are important drivers influencing chemo-responsiveness of tumours and acquired drug resistance, although we still have a poor understanding of how aberrant DNA methylation occurs in tumours. Although drug resistance can be overcome using epigenetic therapies in experimental models, clinical studies have highlighted the challenges of current epigenetic therapies for solid tumours and the need to identify more targeted approaches. Aims and objectives • We will examine whether DNA damage repair causes aberrant DNA hypermethylation in endogenous sequences in tumours and investigate whether DNA mismatch repair influences DNA methylation during acquisition of drug resistance and/or at sites of DNA damage. • We have shown the potential of DNA methylation of Wnt pathway genes in determining clinical outcome in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). We will investigate correlation between epigenetic regulation of Wnt pathways (and other emerging prognostic pathways epigenetically regulated), clinical outcome, and pathway function in EOC. • We will characterise candidate drivers of cisplatin resistance in EOC by investigating functional effects on chemosensitivity and methylation changes occurring in matched tumours and plasma before and after chemotherapy. • Histone methyltransferases (HKMTs) have a key role in the maintenance of drug-resistant tumour-sustaining (stem cell) subpopulation of cells. We will investigate the phenotypic consequences of HKMT inhibition in ovarian tumour cells and sustaining subpopulations. Our approach will remain translational: identifying validated targets and novel therapy strategies which can be taken through experimental models into clinical studies. We will focus on ovarian cancer; although as appropriate include collaborative studies on other tumour types. Methods We will place emphasis on identifying clinically relevant biomarkers in well annotated tumour samples. To understand function of biomarkers we will use ovarian cell lines and cells grown ex vivo directly from patient tumour, as well as cell subpopulations isolated by flow cytometry. We will use a variety of established methods of epigenetic analysis, including bisulphite sequencing, differential methylation hybridization, ChIPseq, SiRNA knock-down amongst others. How results will be used Our long-term aims are to characterise epigenetic changes that affect tumour progression and acquired drug resistance, and that can inform clinical trial designs using stratification biomarkers and identify targets for novel therapeutic approaches to improve patient survival.

However, prostate cancer is difficult to manage clinically, due to a poor current understanding of what dictates its highly variable natural history, and of what underlies the development of castration-resistant disease. The aetiology of this disease and in particular the reasons for ethnic differences in incidence are not understood. There is an urgent requirement to execute a large-scale and highly integrated research programme that will achieve breakthrough advances in understanding the molecular and cellular basis of this disease, including the identification of new biomarkers and drug targets. Specific Aims of Research: We [International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC)-Prostate Cancer] are a group of French, Canadian, US, Asian, and UK investigators. This is an application to fund the UK, Asian, and US members of the consortium. The proposed project consists of a Pilot Study and a Full Study. The aim of the Pilot Study is to set up and test a multi-centre structure that complies with ICGC standards. The aim of the Full Study is to determine the full genome DNA sequence for 250 prostate specimens, mostly cancers. The overall scientific aims are: (i) to understand molecular basis of the clinical heterogeneity of prostate cancer; (ii) to understand the large variation in incidences that occur in different populations and ethnic groups; (iii) to understand the molecular basis of development of castration-resistant and metastatic disease; (iv) to determine whether driving genetic alterations are unique to cancer epithelium or may also occur in morphological ‘normal’ epithelium and stroma; and (v) to subsequently collect genome wide transcriptomics and epigenetic data to provide integrated models of cancer development.

Specifically, we uncovered a narrow window of epigenetic sensitivity in gliomagenesis, during which tumor development is dependent on the role of Ezh2, the main enzyme responsible for H3K27 trimethylation within Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). Following the establishment of bona-fide glioma initiating cells (GICs), we found in fact that the Polycomb axis becomes dispensable for tumor self-renewal, an unexpected result that invites a revision of the current model of Polycomb action in tumorigenesis and affords the opportunity to characterize the establishment and maintenance of cancer stem cell compartments in terms of functionally relevant epigenetic changes. Our objective is thus to dissect the epigenetic basis of glioma recurrence, using the regulatory networks we are uncovering in our epigenetically modulated murine models to interrogate a uniquely rare cohort of human GBM samples, in which we can analyse for the first time in the same patient the progression of epigenetic changes during GBM recurrence. As surgery at GBM relapse is exceedingly rare, this cohort of well-established samples represent a unique opportunity to relate disease progression to epigenetic changes. Setting itself apart from the wealth of largely descriptive studies however, our approach interrogates the transcriptomic and epigenomic deregulation of human glioma recurrence through an innovative combination of experimental and computational approaches that is based on the reverse engineering of gene networks emerging from our functional validation of disease stages upon epigenetic modulation.

The loss of structural brush border proteins is generally believed to be a consequence, rather than a cause, of the loss of differentiation and polarization occurring during tumor progression. We have recently demonstrated that the loss of MYO1A, a brush border structural protein, drives the tumorigenic process in colorectal cancer (PNAS 2012;109(5):1530). The loss of MYO5B, another brush border myosin, has recently been shown to disrupt the epithelial brush border. Moreover, MYO5B is located in chromosome 18q21, the genomic region most frequently deleted in colorectal tumors, and the loss of MYO5B expression or promoter methylation contribute to the oncogenic process of gastric tumors and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, respectively. Here we propose to use isogenic in vitro systems, animal models and the screening of large human tumor collections to investigate the role of MYO5B in colorectal cancer progression. We will investigate genetic/epigenetic mechanisms of MYO5B inactivation. we will also investigate the mechanisms of tumor suppression of MYO5B. In addition, we will use a murine animal model to investigate Myo5b tumor suppression in vivo and high through-put screening to dissect the underlying molecular mechanisms. Finally, we will investigate the association between MYO5B and survival of patients with different tumor stages. Collectively, these experiments will significantly contribute to elucidate the novel role of the loss of polarization/differentiation in the early stages of colorectal tumorigenesis, and may validate MYO5B as a novel prognostic marker for colorectal cancer patients.

Polycomb protein complexes modify chromatin to repress developmental regulator genes and are emerging as key drivers of the epigenetic changes that occur in cancer. One of the clearest links between disruption to polycomb function and tumourigenesis is found in endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS). ESS can arise from the waves of proliferation and differentiation that stromal cells undergo as they differentiate into decidual cells during each menstrual cycle. Women with ESS are most often treated by hysterectomy but many patients have late recurrence or metastases, which are not responsive to chemotherapy. ESS commonly displays translocation of chromosomes 7 and 17, fusing JAZF1 in place of the N-terminus of the polycomb protein SUZ12/JJAZ1. This JAZF1-SUZ12 fusion protein promotes proliferation and inhibits apoptosis, indicating a role in cell transformation. How this fusion event regulates polycomb function during decidualisation and how it contributes to ESS tumourigenesis is unknown. We have found that JAZF1-SUZ12 fusion removes SUZ12 non-coding RNA binding activity, which functions in targeting polycomb to chromatin. We hypothesise that this alters polycomb targeting, leading to changes in epigenetic modification and to cell transformation. To test this, we will use genome-wide measurements of protein-DNA interaction (ChIP-Seq) to identify the changes in epigenetic modifications caused by JAZF1 fusion in endometrial stromal cells. We will then determine whether these chromatin changes are associated with cell transformation and seek to identify the genes disregulated by JAZF1-SUZ12 that are driving this process. This work will define the epigenetic changes that govern endometrial stromal cell tumourigenesis and provide a model for developing a broader understanding of the role of polycomb proteins in cancer.

45	Dr Duncan Sproul	University of Edinburgh	None	2013-03-01	2014-02-28	Do Polycomb Complexes Repress BRCA1 in Sporadic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer?	Germline mutations in BRCA1 strongly predispose individuals to breast and ovarian cancer. Somatic mutations in BRCA1 are very rare but a significant proportion of sporadic triple negative breast cancers are phenotypically and molecularly similar to BRCA1 -mutant cancers. The loss of BRCA1 expression in these sporadic cases is proposed to be central to their biology, but the mechanism responsible for this loss is unknown. Patients with sporadic BRCA1 -deficient tumours may benefit from PARP inhibitor therapy which exploits the deficiency in homologous-repair mechanisms caused by the loss of BRCA1 , but their clinical identification is currently difficult. In a small percentage of sporadic breast tumours, BRCA1 is subject to epigenetic repression in association with promoter DNA hypermethylation. Repression by polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) frequently precedes DNA hypermethylation in both normal and cancerous cells and EZH2 , a component of the PRC2 complex, is highly expressed in sporadic BRCA1-deficient cancers. We will determine whether PRCs cause BRCA1 repression in pre-clinical cell line models of sporadic BRCA1 -deficient breast cancer to determine the potential utility of epigenetic biomarkers for the identification of sporadic BRCA1 -deficient cases in the clinic. In particular, PRC repression in normal cells is accompanied by chromatin compaction that is detectable by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH). We will evaluate whether BRCA1 repression by PRCs in breast cancer is also accompanied by chromatin compaction and, therefore, whether FISH can be used to identify sporadic BRCA1 -deficient breast cancer cases in the clinic.

46	Dr Kelly Coffey	Newcastle University	None	2014-02-01	2021-01-31	Characterisation of androgen receptor epigenetic co-regulators as potential therapeutic targets in castrate resistant prostate cancer.	Castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a significant clinical problem with no effective therapies. In order to develop novel therapies, the mechanism underlying CRPC must be investigated. The androgen receptor (AR) is consistently demonstrated to be a key molecule in the development of castrate resistant disease. There are a number of mechanisms by which this occurs, for example the AR can be amplified enabling activation by lower androgen levels in the body or mutated to generate a promiscuous receptor. I propose that indirectly targeting the AR with therapies directed at co-activator proteins may be an effective way to treat CRPC. To test this hypothesis, an in depth study will be carried out to determine the role of epigenetic AR regulators in CRPC. Specifically, genes and pathways regulated by epigenetic modulation of AR signalling will be identified, how they regulate clinically relevant AR mutants, how the modulators themselves are regulated and what signalling pathways influence AR activity in CRPC. As an example, KMT5A, a lysine mono-methyltransferase, which functions as an AR repressor in a model of androgen dependent disease (LNCaP) and an AR co-activator in models of castrate resistance will be investigated as a therapeutic target for CRPC.

47	Dr Tom Milne	University of Oxford	None	2012-04-01	2017-03-31	The Epigenetic Control of Gene Expression in Leukaemia and Haematopoiesis	The Mixed Lineage Leukaemia 1 protein (MLL1) protein is important for the epigenetic regulation of gene expression during stem and progenitor cell development but is also mutated in a subset of aggressive human leukaemias. The most common leukaemic disruptions of the MLL1 gene are chromosome translocations that fuse the N terminus of MLL1 in frame with over 40 different partner genes creating novel fusion proteins. Recent work has suggested that wild type MLL1 and MLL1 fusion proteins cooperate in leukaemogenesis by together causing aberrant epigenetic profiles at target genes in vivo. Epigenetic changes are often defined as heritable changes in gene expression or chromosome stability that don’t alter the underlying DNA sequence. We are interested in identifying the key molecular events in MLL1 mediated leukaemogenesis in order to fully understand the epigenetic basis for this disease. This major goal has been divided into three key questions: 1) What key downstream gene targets are essential for MLL1 mediated leukaemogenesis?; 2) how do MLL1 and MLL1 fusion proteins control epigenetic gene regulation on a molecular level?; and 3) how are MLL1 and MLL1 fusion proteins recruited to important gene targets in the cell? To answer these questions, we are using xenograft transplant assays to identify Leukaemic Stem Cells (LSCs) in MLL1 patient samples, ChIP-seq to identify and characterise direct gene targets in specific haematopoietic cell populations, small molecular inhibitors and siRNA combined with ChIP and ChIP-seq to determine how MLL1 fusion proteins regulate gene targets in the cell and MLL1 domain analysis coupled with genome wide techniques to determine how MLL1 is recruited to gene targets in the cell. Answering these questions may not only be useful for future therapeutic strategies, but will also inform our basic understanding of epigenetic gene regulation during normal stem and progenitor cell development.

We aim to: (1) maximise the potential of the ERC cohorts to enable the definition of developmental influences on major childhood and adult disorders, and examine hypotheses relating to prenatal/postnatal mismatch, epigenetic processes and economic consequences; and (2) conduct intervention studies in young women to improve their health and that of their children. Research proposals: Within the SWS and our other mother-offspring cohorts we shall examine the hypothesis that maternal and lifestyle influences from before conception, and mismatches between the fetal/infant and later childhood environment, have detrimental effects on body composition, cardiovascular structure and function, respiratory disease and atopy, and cognition. Data from Helsinki and from other European cohorts will be used to increase our understanding of influences on major adult disorders, notably cardiovascular disease and cancer. Within our EpiGen consortium we aim to define epigenetic biomarkers of later disease risk that will inform intervention studies. Our data resources spanning the lifecourse provide opportunities for comprehensive mechanistic and behavioural insights into chronic diseases and markers at different stages of life. Moreover, in an international collaboration we are defining the economic consequences of a poor start to life, which will inform public health policy and assess the potential impact of focused interventions. Finally, our work has led to four interventions to improve the diets and health behaviours of young women. Three of these target women in pregnancy. The fourth focuses on women of child-bearing age who already have young children. The aim is to improve the health of the women prior to any subsequent pregnancy and that of their children. Impact: Our work contributes to three current MRC research priorities: clinical and public health research, ageing-related research, and biomarkers. The work has a strong clinical and public health focus, our lifecourse approach increases understanding of ageing, and our work on epigenetic processes aims to identify biomarkers that assist in the characterisation of new interventions to improve public health. Our cohort studies will provide evidence as to whether mismatches between the maternal, infant and childhood environments are associated with cardiovascular risk, impaired respiratory health, cognitive development, and obesity. Our intervention studies will provide translational data on the benefits of better nutrition of young women, and have the potential to improve the health of women and children now, and that of future generations.

49	Univ.Prof. Dr. Rudolf ZECHNER	Universität Graz	None	2014-04-01	2019-04-01	The Role of Lipolysis in the Pathogenesis of Cancer-associated Cachexia	Cachexia is a complex syndrome characterized by massive loss of body weight due to uncontrolled loss of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. The wasting occurs during late stages of many unrelated chronic diseases and frequently leads to the death of affected individuals. Cachexia is most common in cancer, where an estimated 25% of patients die from cancer-associated cachexia (CAC) rather than from the cancer. Despite the tremendous impact of CAC on morbidity and mortality, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Recently, we demonstrated that lipase-catalyzed triacylglycerol (TG) catabolism is required for the pathogenesis of CAC. Mice lacking adipose triglyceride lipase, the rate-limiting enzyme for TG hydrolysis (lipolysis), were completely protected from loss of both adipose tissue and muscle in two forms of cancer. This implies an essential role of the lipolytic process in the pathogenesis of CAC. Here we propose to elucidate the causal role of lipases and their coregulators in CAC development. We will determine mechanisms involved and pursue novel treatment strategies. Our objectives are to: - Investigate how different cancers in mice regulate tissue-specific lipolysis; - Elucidate the functional role of lipases and their coregulators in the pathogenesis of CAC; - Assess whether pharmacological inhibition of specific lipases prevents or delays CAC; - Study the effects of cancer-induced lipolysis on energy dissipating pathways and epigenetic control. The project enters a largely unexplored field: the role of lipid metabolism in the pathogenesis of CAC. The work will heavily rely on the characterization of induced mutant mouse models with CAC and require extensive collaboration with experts in pathology and large-scale systems analytics. The results are expected to yield new mechanisms of disease development and provide novel therapeutic targets to prevent the devastating and prevalent consequences of CAC.

50	Dr Ooi	University College London	None	2011-10-01	2016-10-01	How does the X chromosome regulate DNA methylation in pluripotent stem cells?	Epigenetic processes regulate gene transcription states during cellular differentiation, playing key roles in the maintenance of pluripotency and differentiation. Epigenetic alterations are common in diseases such as in cancer and cognitive disorders. Understanding the mechanisms by which epigenetic states are inherited and propagated is of fundamental importance, and will help in the development of biomarkers for screening as well identification of targets for disease treatment.DNA methylation remains the best-characterized epigenetic process. XX pluripotent stem cells (Embryonic Stem (ES) and induced Pluripotent Stem (iPS) cells) display genome-wide hypomethylation relative to XY stem cells but the mechanisms are unknown. This proposal will elucidate the pathways responsible. Irradiation Microcell-Mediated Chromosome Transfer (XMMCT) will be used to identify the critical region(s) of the X chromosome involved. In parallel and as an alternative approach, candidate X-linked genes will be over-expressed in XY ES cells to identify the factors responsible for global hypomethylation. Further insight will be provided using protein interaction screens using epitope-tagged versions of all active Dnmts as well as the known regulators URHF1 and Dnmt3L in XX and XY ES cells. The role of XX-induced hypomethylation in cellular reprogramming will be investigated by using different cell types from Oct4-GFP transgenic mice to examine whether iPS efficiency is affected by cells with a greater propensity to lose DNA methylation. Together these aims will elucidate the signals necessary to maintain global genomic DNA methylation. Aberrant loss is an important hallmark and contributor of disease that could be used for disease diagnosis and treatment. It could also be exploited to help improve the efficiency of cellular reprogramming for regenerative medicine.	European Research Council	Starting Grant	1497710.0	EUR
51	Professor Paolo Salomoni	University College London	None	2014-05-01	2019-05-01	The histone H3.3 variant in brain cancer pathogenesis	Epigenetic reprogramming is a hallmark of brain cancer. Remarkably, driver mutations of the histone H3.3 variant and its loading machinery have been recently found in paediatric glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a devastating neoplasm originating from transformed neural precursors. Thus, the very basic building blocks of chromatin can be mutated in cancer. The present challenge is to define at which level altered H3.3 loading influences GBM pathogenesis and provide clues into the underlying mechanisms. Based on work from our group and others, we hypothesise that alterations of H3.3 function/deposition would lead to epigenetic changes, deregulated transcription at bivalent loci and other genomic regions, and alterations of telomere maintenance mechanisms, in turn contributing to tumourigenesis. The main objectives of this proposal are to: 1. Examine the impact of H3.3 mutations on brain cancer pathogenesis, by determining the effect of mutant H3.3 expression on neural precursor cell transformation (A), and tumour maintenance (B). 2. Define the molecular changes caused by incorporation of H3.3 mutants into the genome and their involvement in tumourigenesis, by A. determining the genome-wide distribution of WT and mutant H3.3 proteins, B. identifying mutant H3.3-driven transcriptional and epigenetic changes, C. defining effects on telomere maintenance mechanisms, and D. connecting mutant H3.3-driven molecular changes to the biological phenotypes. The discovery of mutations in histones and their loading machinery represents a paradigm change in the field of cancer epigenetics. We anticipate this study to provide key insights into the role of these alterations in chromatin regulation and cancer pathogenesis. More broadly, this work will increase our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms governing chromatin modification in mammalian cells.	European Research Council	Consolidator Grant	1999998.0	EUR
52	PROF.SSA GIUSEPPINA CARETTI	University of Milan	None	2014-01-01	2016-12-31	Epigenetic blockade of the myostatin pathway and potential reversal of cancer cachexia	Cachexia is a devastating complication of cancer. It afflicts 80% of cancer patients and accounts for 25-30% cancer deaths. There are currently no effective treatments for muscle wasting in cancer. Myostatin is a member of the transforming growth factor-beta family, and a negative regulator of muscle mass, over-expressed in cachexia. Previous reports show that pharmacological blockade of the myostatin/activin receptor (ActRIIB) completely reverses loss of skeletal muscle and dramatically prolongs survival. Our preliminary data show that the Bromodomain protein BRD4 modulates myostatin and atrogin transcription. The small molecule JQ1 is an epigenetic drug that blocks bromodomain-containing proteins and reduces tumor progression in mouse models of cancer. We found that treatment of myotubes with JQ1 decreases levels of myostatin and muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases and results in myotubes protection from induced-atrophy, in a cell-culture model. Thus, we hypothesize that an epigenetic therapy based on BRD4 pharmacological blockade in the mouse may result in abrogation of myostatin signaling, decrease in muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases expression, and alleviate the catabolic effects of cachexia. To test this hypothesis, we will evaluate whether BRD4 pharmacological blockade by JQ1 restores muscle function, using an established mouse model of cancer cachexia. We will evaluate weight loss and survival in tumor-bearing mice treated with JQ1. We will examine the impact of JQ1 treatment on primary skeletal muscle stem cells and investigate how JQ1 modifies the expression profile of muscles, and elucidate catabolic molecular mechanisms altered by JQ1 treatment. This proposal attempts to validate an epigenetic therapeutic strategy for muscle wasting by decreasing myostatin and the muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases, in a mouse model of cancer cachexia. If successful, it may provide the rationale for the use of JQ1 in cancer cachexia treatment and/or show how JQ1 administration to block progression of certain cancers may concurrently reverse cancer cachexia.

Cellular senescence is an important tumor suppressor mechanism. Senescent cells exhibit marked chromatin reorganization and this contributes to senescence-mediated tumor suppression. Employing in vitro cell culture, in vivo mouse models, human tissues across a spectrum of disease stages and state-of-the-art epigenomics, this programme investigates three molecular mechanisms of chromatin regulation that control senescence and its efficacy as a tumor suppression mechanism.<br/><br/>Project 1. Investigate the role of histone H4 methylation in senescence and tumor suppression. The histone methyltransferase SUV420H2 methylates histone H4 on lysine 20 to generate H4K20me3. Evidence indicates that H4K20me3 serves as a barrier to tumor progression by reinforcing cellular senescence. We will investigate the role of SUV420H2 and H4K20me3 in senescence and their impact on senescence-associated tumor suppression in vivo. <br/><br/>Project 2. Investigate CpG island DNA methylation in senescence and its impact on tumor suppression. Altered DNA methylation is a hallmark of cancer cells. Focal hypermethylation of CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes contributes to their stable silencing and consequently tumorigenesis. By whole-genome single-nucleotide bisulfite-sequencing of DNA from proliferating and senescent cells, we found that senescent cells also show increased methylation of CpG islands, including at some tumor suppressor genes that are methylated in cancer. Paradoxically, this suggests that senescent cells harbor epigenetic changes that undermine the efficacy of senescence as tumor suppressor mechanism. We will investigate the mechanism of CpG island methylation in senescence and its impact on cell senescence and tumor suppression. <br/><br/>Project 3. Investigate control of retrotransposons in senescent cells. The human genome harbors L1 retrotransposons that can insert de novo elsewhere in the genome. These disruptive insertions are thought to promote cancer. In cancer cells, global DNA hypomethylation is thought to promote activation of retrotransposons. As well as focal hypermethylation of CpG islands, senescent cells, like cancer cells, also exhibit global DNA hypomethylation. This is expected to promote activity of retrotransposons. We will investigate two mechanisms, interferon signaling and the HUCA histone chaperone, whose activation in senescence is proposed to counter activation of oncogenic retrotransposons. <br/><br/>There is currently considerable excitement over chromatin as a target zone for cancer drug and biomarker discovery. Completion of these objectives can lead to advances in early detection and intervention to combat this disease.	Cancer Research UK	Renewing Programme Award	None	None
55	Dr Sarah Daniels	University of Sheffield	None	2013-08-01	2014-04-30	Epigenetic modification of the BRCA1 promoter and breast cancer phenotype	Background Tumours associated with mutations in the Breast Cancer susceptibility 1 gene, BRCA1, are associated with a higher rate of particularly aggressive, overlapping subtypes of breast cancers called the Triple Negative (TN) and basal phenotypes. TN cancers do not express oestrogen, progesterone or ERBB-2 (HER-2) receptors and are associated with a poor prognosis compared with many of the other subtypes. Overall the TN subtype accounts for around 16% of all breast cancers whereas in BRCA1 carriers it accounts for over 50% (Rummel, Varner et al. 2012). It has also been noted that the BRCA1 associated TN phenotype is common in women with a family history of breast cancer where no genetic mutation has been identified (Wong, Southey et al. 2011). This has led to the hypothesis that other mechanisms of inactivation of the BRCA1 gene may be important, with a particular focus on epigenetic gene silencing through aberrant methylation of the BRCA1 promoter. A number of small studies suggest that methylation of the BRCA1 promoter, detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) DNA is associated with TN phenotype cancers (Snell, Krypuy et al. 2008) and that the level of methylation correlates with number of BRCA1 morphological features (Wong, Southey et al 2011). We have preliminary data from 310 women with breast cancer, including 52 with TN breast cancer, that hypermethylation of two individual CpG sites within the BRCA1 promoter in PMBC DNA may distinguish TN from non-TN tumours. Aims Our aims are firstly to determine the relationships between lymphocyte DNA methylation of the BRCA1 gene and (a) BRCA1 methylation in the tumour, (b) BRCA1 protein levels in the tumour, (c) tumour phenotype and behaviour. Secondly we aim to characterise the distribution of BRCA1 methylation in healthy control subjects. Methods Pyrosequencing of bisulphite treated DNA will be used to determine methylation levels at distinct methylation sites (CpGs) using PBMC DNA from 500 cases and 500 control subjects, and matched FFPE tumour samples. Immunohistochemistry will be used to look for BRCA1 protein expression in the tumour specimens. Tumours will also be scored for the presence of BRCA1-like morphological features. Further questions arising from the work that could be addressed as part of a PhD project include development of PBMC methylation levels as biomarkers and mechanistic studies to investigate how BRCA1 is inactivated and how this leads to particular tumour phenotype.

There are many unmet clinical needs regarding the management of prostate cancer including more specific tests to identify individuals who need to undergo prostate biopsy and improved risk stratifying of patients with early prostate cancer needing direct therapy. Epigenetic changes play a more significant role in early tumour development than previously thought. Hypermethylation patterns, a marker of epigenetic change, of tumour suppressor genes may provide useful risk stratification for patients with early tumours. Hypermethylation of secreted Wnt antagonist genes has been demonstrated in a wide range of tumours, indicating that silencing is a common feature of solid tumourigenesis. Silencing of the Wnt antagonists has been reported in prostate cancer as well. Aims: The purpose of this project is to analyse epigenetic changes in secreted Wnt antagonist genes that occur in prostate cancer and to determine whether these events can be exploited to provide supplementary biomarkers for prostate cancer staging and prognosis. How the results of this project will be used: If this preliminary study shows promising evidence, the data will be used to expand our research into the role of epigenetic changes in prostate cancer with a follow-up project.

57	Paola Scaffidi	Cancer Research Uk London Research Institute	None	2014-01-01	2020-12-31	Cancer Epigenetics Laboratory	The goal of this group is to uncover fundamental principles of cancer development, with particular emphasis on epigenetic mechanisms regulating cancer stem cell (CSC) function and tumour organization. Cancer is a clonal disease originating from a single cell. Yet, most human cancers are characterized by astounding intra-tumour heterogeneity and comprise various subpopulations of cells with distinct phenotypes and biological properties. Even neighbouring cells within a tumour may have different morphologies, express differential transcriptional programs and display specific repertoires of surface molecules. Most importantly, not all cancer cells possess the same proliferative potential and in most cancers only a subset of cells is truly immortal. These cells act as CSCs and are responsible for maintaining the long-term growth of the tumour. This group is interested in understanding how epigenetic mechanisms involving histone modifications, higher-order chromatin structure and DNA methylation contribute to intra-tumour heterogeneity and how they affect CSC function. State-of-the-art molecular and cell biological methods in combination with advanced light microscopy techniques and in vivo approaches are used to characterize functionally important epigenetic traits of CSCs, with the ultimate goal of identifying novel therapeutic targets.

Using ES cells as a powerful tool, we will assess the progression of epigenetic reprogramming at ICRs upon Parp1 deletion and the factors involved. In a series of intercalated experiments, we will elucidate whether Parp1 is an integral component of the ICR chromatin protein complex, or whether it is the conferred post-translational modification of ICR complex members that is critical for imprint maintenance. We will also test whether the few genomic regions that are hypomethylated in Parp1-/- ES cells in addition to known ICRs demarcate yet unknown imprinting control regions that may identify novel imprinted genes. In parallel, the impact of Parp1 deficiency on imprinted gene regulation in vivo will be scrutinized. We will assess existing knockout models (of mild severity level) of Parp1, the highly related Parp2, and double mutants. The analyses will include to determine, in candidate and genome-wide approaches, the effect on DNA methylation, histone modifications (H3K9me3) and imprinted gene expression during gestation and postnatally. This will be complemented by a detailed analysis of developmental progression, postnatal and adult health, including assessment of the putative link to obesity that has been previously noted. Germ line mutants will serve to determine whether Parp1 (& Parp2) play a role in the establishment as well as the maintenance of gametic imprints, in epigenome surveillance and protection from transgenerational inheritance of epimutations. This research is pertinent to our understanding of imprinting disorders and how they might arise for example in infertility treatments. Thereby, it will identify novel avenues for potential therapeutic intervention. It also provides direct links between epigenome (dys)regulation and cancer biology, in which Parp1 is a major player.

However, the persisting poor prognosis of melanoma patients, due to drug resistance and early relapse, underscores the need for additional biomarkers that complement currently applied stratification strategies. In this respect, recent translational research suggests a clinical value of regulatory events; and in particular DNA methylation, which has been recognized as common hallmark of human cancers. Although DNA methylation represents a promising biomarker for clinical diagnosis, prognosis and with a plethora of alterations displaying predictive potential for drug response, the potential of DNA methylation alterations in individualized cancer medicine has yet been poorly recognized. Consequently, we comprehensively screen epigenetic alterations in metastatic melanoma specimens and model systems for their translational value as biomarkers for drug resistance, in order to suggest novel therapeutic strategies overcoming drug resistance. Specifically, we profile a unique set of samples, consisting of drug resistant melanoma cell lines and donor-matched metastatic tumours at genome-scale for differentially DNA methylated loci. Furthermore, we integrate comprehensive DNA methylation and drug sensitivity data to BRAF and MEK inhibitors, to determine predictive models of the efficiency of drug application in melanoma patients. Following the epigenetic association study combining DNA methylation and drug sensitivity, the functional implications of candidate loci and genes are experimentally confirmed using in vitro and in vivo melanoma model systems. Once we confirm the reliability of the candidates in multiple biological and clinical validation steps, we present epigenetic biomarkers, mechanistically incorporated in drug resistance of melanoma cells to currently applied targeted drugs, which provide a rich source for novel therapeutic strategies applicable as precision medicine for melanoma patients.

Epigenetic reprogramming caused by IDH1 and IDH2 mutations have been implicated previously in brain and cartilaginous tumours. Recently, driver mutations in the histone 3.3 (H3.3) variant have been identified in over 50% of paediatric glioblastoma multiforme cases and we have also found that these mutations are found in ~60% of conventional central and dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas: the mutations in both these brain and bone tumours lead to modifications of the epigenetic landscape. The identification of direct alterations of the basic building blocks of chromatin represents a paradigm shift in our understanding of cancer epigenetics. Very recently, we have also reported that H3.3 variants are mutated in primary central bone (H3F3A in 92% of giant cell tumours and H3F3B in 95% of chondroblastoma), thus suggesting that direct alterations of histones are more common than previously thought. Several questions remain unanswered: are histone mutations transforming? In which cell type(s) and at which developmental/differentiation stage(s) do the mutations exert their transforming potential? What are the molecular changes caused by deposition of mutant histones? Do H3.3 mutations work in part through a non-cell autonomous mechanism? This proposal will address these questions. In particular, we aim to determine the biological and molecular consequences of bone/cartilage tumour-associated H3.3 mutations. Furthermore, we have set out how we will correlate the epigenetic and transcriptome changes imposed by H3.3 mutations across the different tumour types (bone and brain). Overall, this study will contribute to explaining the mechanisms by which the H3.3 mutations bring about the disease phenotypes. Our finding will provide opportunities for developing targeted therapies, which may be valuable for treating more than one tumour type.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	464091.0	GBP

A non-invasive test for the detection of bladder cancer in urinary sediment cells	Cystoscopic investigation for bladder cancer in patients with haematuria and in patients requiring surveillance for recurrent disease incurs a cost to UK healthcare estimated at £55.39 million per year ranking bladder as one of the most expensive cancers to manage. We have developed a highly multiplexed targeted sequencing assay (UroMark) to detect cancer specific epigenetic alterations in urinary sediment, along with a home collection kit allowing the collection of urine through the postal system. The UroMark assay utilises a micro-droplet PCR platform (RainDance Technology) which allows the analysis of a panel of 150 epigenetically altered loci which accurately discriminate between tumour and normal urothelium. Proof of concept testing has shown the potential utility of this assay for the detection of bladder cancer in urinary sediment cells. The aim this project is to validate the UroMark assay through two non-IMP clinical trials. DETECT I, will determine if the assay can rule out bladder cancer in patients with haematuria and DETECT II will validate the diagnostic accuracy of the test in a cohort trial enriched for low grade cancer. Our aim is to show sufficient diagnostic precision to replace cystoscopy in the evaluation of patients with haematuria. The incorporation of a highly sensitive and specific assay will revolutionise bladder cancer pathways, have a profound impact on the requirement for cystoscopy and on patient well being and, reduce the healthcare costs associated with investigation of haematuria and surveillance for disease recurrence.

Drawing on additional strengths in the MRC Human Genetics Unit, MRC Farr Institute, CRUK Cancer Centre, EPSRC-funded supercomputer facilities and industrial collaborations, we will establish a Masters by Research in Molecular Pathology, and thus train a new generation of scientists who will develop new assays, algorithms and standards for genome and epigenome analysis and interpretation for clinical use. We will implement state-of-the-art genome technologies to mainstream molecular diagnosis of Mendelian diseases in adult medicine and establish rapid genetic diagnosis of acutely ill children and neonates. We will develop "liquid biopsies" for managing cancer via genetic and epigenetic analyses of tumours and cell-free circulating DNA and will use state-of-the art digital imaging, image analysis and spectroscopy of tumours to provide more precise diagnoses and predictive stratification for patient management. The leads for this proposal all work at the interface of academia and the NHS and, by defining diagnostic standards in collaboration with the UK National External Quality Assurance Scheme (UK NEQAS) for Molecular Pathology and Genetics, hosted in Edinburgh by NHS Lothian, can ensure that these innovations are translated rapidly to clinical practice in the NHS. The Node's activities will be dovetailed with industry at every stage: technology development, assay design and implementation, data interpretation and clinical validation. The new Molecular Pathology Masters programme will produce and sustain a generation of new academic pathologists and help create a virtual Centre for Molecular Pathology as a basis for a substantive MRC Centre in the longer term.

These powerful tools are currently being developed and involve the CRISPR/Cas9 system with slight modifications whereby the Cas9 is inactive and fused to DNA methyltransferases or 5-methylcytosine TET oxidases. We are implementing this system in collaboration with the Jurkowski lab (Stuttgart University) to understand epigenetic processes that occur during cancer initiation. Selection of the genomic regions targeted for epimutations is based on the knowledge accumulated so far in cancer epigenetics research. Numerous promoters are hypermethylated in cancer but key is the identification of combinations of genes that have the potential to be drivers in the process of cancer initiation when no genetic mutation is required. The cell types to test these epimutations on were chosen based on the hypothesis that cancer stem cells can arise from adult stem cell compartments or through dedifferentiation/reprogramming of progenitors or differentiated cells. This is compatible with the knowledge that cancer stem cells harbour stem cell-like properties. Therefore we will start by using mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), neural stem cells (NS), mammary epithelial and myoepithelial cells. Cells harbouring the induced epimutations will be analysed for tumourigenic properties in vitro and injected in immune-compromised mice in order to measure tumour growth in vivo. Subsequently these tumours will be utilised to unravel the molecular analysis of cellular transformation. In Objective 2, we will use the embryonic stem cell model system where transition between two states (primed to ground) is accompanied by widespread DNA demethylation. The methodology involves use of shRNA libraries (whole genome and sub-libraries) to find proteins involved in the DNA demethylation pathway.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	679059.0	GBP

They promote the growth and invasion of cancer cells and are known for their tumor-promoting properties. Compared to normal fibroblasts (NFs), CAFs are permanently activated. Several studies report that CAFs are epigenetically distinct from NFs. Because it is becoming clear that the crosstalk between cancer cells and CAFs plays a pivotal role in cancer, understanding this communication-based relationship has the potential to include CAFs in the shooting range of cancer therapy. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles that carry proteins, mRNA, ncRNAs and DNA. We have recently shown intercellular trafficking via exosomes contributes to horizontal reprogramming and functional re-education of recipient cells. Our preliminary data shows that NFs undergo significant changes in epigenetic marks when exposed to cancer exosomes. Furthermore, we have found that specific proteins present in cancer exosomes involved in epigenetic changes in the DNA of CAFs. Therefore, we hypothesize that cancer exosomes contain epigenetic regulators leading to changes in gene expression in CAFs, ultimately supporting its tumor-promoting properties. To address our hypothesis we will use state of the art technology available at our laboratory to analyze exosomes, and orthotopic as well as genetically modified mouse models. The research team is multidisciplinary, with a strong collaborative past, and with experts with an excellent track record in all the fields relevant for the project. Our project brings about a novel concept of communication via exosomes, through which cancer cells subjugate other cellular components of the tumor microenvironment to support and sustain tumor growth and invasion. Most importantly, our project paves the way for the possibility of targeting cellular communication-mediated by exosomes as an anti-cancer therapy.

Our unique patient cohort enables the observation of the natural clinical history of pre-invasive lesions and the longitudinal biopsy sampling of individual lesions, newly arising lesions, control airway and samples such as sputum and blood/serum. It is likely that the epigenetic and genetic programming of pre-invasive cancer-propagating cells defines their proliferation, differentiation, survival and future treatment sensitivity, but this remains unexplored. I will use our unique tissue biobank to develop clinically useful biomarkers of pre-invasive lesion progression, document the biological steps in pre-invasive disease progression to invasion, determine the key mechanisms driving progression and design and challenge chemo-prevention strategies.

66	Prof Sir Shankar Balasubramanian	University of Cambridge	None	2015-10-01	2020-09-30	Structure, function and chemical biology of nucleic acids	Background During the past ten years, we have established an integrated programme of fundamental research to elucidate the structure and function of nucleic acids through the application of chemical biology. Our laboratory focuses on non-canonical four-stranded DNA structures called G-quadruplexes (G4s) in the genome. This structural motif is implicated in cancer biology and is a potential molecular target for therapeutics. Aims We will explore the chemical perturbation of genome function using small molecules with the aim of understanding the importance of G4s to cancer biology. The programme consists of three closely related areas: -G-quadruplexes and transcription. Evaluation of mechanistic details of refined G4 ligands in cancer gene transcription and the elucidation of ligand selectivity and the potential to inhibit cancer cell growth. -G-quadruplexes and genome instability. Exploiting synergies with known cancer-related genetic backgrounds and the discovery and characterisation of new synergies using optimised ligands. -Drug-DNA interactions in the genome. Synthesis and optimisation of the mapping of cisplatin analogue binding sites in DNA and their association with epigenetic changes in cisplatin-sensitive and resistant ovarian cancer cells. We will also map the binding of G4 ligands to the genome. Methods We will create new ways to apply the principles of molecular biophysics and chemical biology on a genome scale towards the basic mechanistic understanding of nucleic acid function. Using chemistry and genomics, we will also develop new methodologies to better appreciate drug-DNA interactions within a cellular context. We will adopt an integrated, interdisciplinary approach that focuses on our core strengths: molecular biophysics, small molecule-DNA interactions and chemical biology. How results of this research will be used Our results will provide fundamental insights into the importance of DNA secondary structures in genome function and for cancer biology. Our chemical biological studies explore mechanisms that will ultimately lead to the identification of new cancer pathways. Our research will be augmented by close collaborations involving structural biology, cell biology, genomics and bioinformatics in our sister laboratory at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute (CRUK CI), and with established partnerships with international leaders. Although this programme is centred on fundamental studies any novel methods or compounds with interesting biological activity will be considered for possible further development with guidance from CRT and Cambridge Enterprise. Any translational opportunities will be developed with expertise from our clinical collaborators Carlos Caldas, James Brenton and Duncan Jodrell at the CRUK CI.

Characterization of the molecular mechanisms regulating CSC function is crucial to develop CSC-targeted therapies. Yet, due to the difficulty of isolating pure CSC populations and manipulating them ex vivo, our understanding of their biological properties is still limited. We have recently overcome these limitations by developing a method for the generation of human cells with functional hallmarks of CSCs through oncogenic reprogramming of somatic cells in vitro. Being controlled and amenable to experimental manipulation, this system represents a unique tool to study CSC biology. We will use in vitro-generated CSCs to perform CRISPR/Cas-based loss-of-function screens, with the aim of discovering novel mechanisms important for CSC formation and function. This study has the potential to identify novel biomarkers and new molecular targets for cancer therapies. Aims and Methods 1. Generation of a fluorescent CSC reporter. In order to monitor the phenotype of tumorigenic CSCs in living, unstained cells, we will generate a dual-color CSC fluorescent reporter, taking advantage of genes which are strongly up- or down-regulated in in vitro-generated CSCs and correlate with tumorigenic potential. 2. Primary screening. CSCs or partially-reprogrammed precursor cell lines expressing the fluorescent reporters will be used in two distinct CRISPR/Cas loss-of-function screens using available pooled gRNA libraries. In the first screen we will use the partially reprogrammed cells and screen for gRNAs which promote CSC appearance, to identify tumor suppressors. In the second screen, we will use the CSCs and screen for gRNAs which inhibit their tumorigenicity, to discover novel therapeutic targets. 3. Hit validation. To rule out off-target effects, primary hits will be validated using distinct gRNAs, and by performing rescue experiments. As a final read–out, in vivo xenograft assays will be used to assess cell tumor-initiating ability. How the results of this research will be used Based on preliminary results, we expect to identify numerous proteins affecting CSC formation and function. Priority for validation in clinically-derived CSCs will be assigned based on various criteria: correlation between gene expression profiles and clinical outcome using publicly available datasets, existence of reported mutations, single cell analysis on tumor sections, target druggability and availability of tool compounds. Follow-up drug screening will be performed using the same experimental system and read-outs. The prognostic value of the identified hits will also be analyzed.

Abnormal epigenetic patterns, including of histone-methylation, are implicated in cancer onset and progression, and small-molecules targeting chromatin regulators have been introduced for cancer therapies. N-Methylation of lysine- and arginine- residues on histone tails is an important mechanism of transcriptional regulation. Such methylation catalysed by methyltransferases (KMTs) and reversed by demethylases (KDMs). Dysregulation of some KDMs is strongly linked to cancer and some KDMs are current therapeutic targets. However, despite the emerging pathophysiological importance of KDMs, the biologically relevant substrate selectivity and the roles of most KDMs are far from clear. The largest KDM family are the JmjC enzymes which are Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate dependent oxygenases. Extensive preliminary results reveal JmjC members have demethylase or hydroxylase activities and that some act on non-histone substrates. Aims We aim to carry out comprehensive functional assignments of human members of JmjC family of demethylases / hydroxylases, at biochemical and cellular levels, that will enable their roles in cancer to be placed on a sound molecular basis. Methods We will establish the substrate selectivity of recombinant human JmjC enzymes using appropriate substrates including histone peptides, full-length histones and intact appropriately modified nucleosomes; non-histone substrates will also be explored. The roles of the catalytic and non-catalytic domains will be systematically established. Alternative potential substrates/binding partners will also be investigated using techniques validated for oxygenase substrate discovery, including RNA and phage display. The structural basis of selectivity will be explored using biophysical techniques including crystallography, NMR and mass spectrometry. Parallel work in cells, including using mass spectrometric methodologies, will be used both to identify JmjC substrates (including non-histone substrates) and validate predictions regarding selectivity following from work with isolated proteins. We will work with an extensive network of collaborators to disseminate the results for use in inhibition studies aimed at validating JmjC enzymes as cancer targets. How the results of this research will be used The functional assignment results will be used both by the large research communities working on relationships between altered mechanisms of epigenetic regulation and cancer. They will also be enabling for the academic and pharmaceutical scientists pursuing KDMs as cancer targets– an understanding of function is essential both for establishing optimal screens and in interpreting the results of inhibitors in cells and animal models/clinical trials.

Such a method, if created, will be highly used by the research community to study chromatin remodeling in cancer initiation and progression and search for prognostic and predictive epigenetic markers correlating with drug sensitivity and/or overall patient survival. Such retrospective studies are not possible so far as the current approach to get cancer-specific epigenetic profiles via engrafting human tumors into mice cannot be applied to existing collections of frozen tumors. Characterization of epigenetic landscape in cancer has already provided insights into several important biological phenomena: formation of de novo enhancers/super-enhancers and long range epigenetic silencing during tumorigenesis. Moreover, a wide panel of ‘epigenetic’ drugs (inhibitors of EZH2, HDAC, BRD4 and CDK7) has been shown to be efficient in a number of cancer cell lines and mouse models. The next step would be to characterize epigenetic landscape in primary tumors of cancer patients and associate the observed changes with clinical information. However, this step is not possible without a method that would allow deconvolution of the signal coming from cancer and normal cells in ChIP-seq/DNAse-seq/ATAC-seq data generated for primary tumors. Creation of such a method is the purpose of this proposal. The project will include two phases: algorithm definition and validation on simulated and experimental datasets. To assess the performance of our method on experimental data, we will use mixtures of normal and cancer cell lines. Our methodology will include independent component analysis or nonnegative matrix factorization. It will account for variable copy number in cancer genomes, GC and mappability bias, variable signal-to-noise ratio between different experiments, and variable contamination of the tumor sample by normal cells.

Overall five-year survival has remained less than 5% over the last 50 years and is the lowest of the 21 most common cancers in England. It is characterised by a dense fibrotic stroma with activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs). In addition to genetic changes, it is now increasingly recognised that epigenetic mechanisms play a major role in cancer development and drug resistance. Epigenetics can be defined as heritable changes in gene expression without a change in DNA sequence. Epigenetic control of gene expression can be via chemical alteration of the DNA (usually by methylation of cytosines) or through modifications of histones (proteins that pack the DNA into chromatin, the main component of chromosomes). Little is known about epigenetic mechanisms that are important in pancreatic cancer. The aim of this study is to identify key epigenetic drivers of chemotherapy resistance in pancreatic cancer. Using techniques to search the whole genome for histone modifications, I will study the changes in pancreatic cancer cells that show a differential response to chemotherapy. Since the tumour stroma also plays a major role in pancreatic cancer, I will also study the epigenetic mechanisms that drive the change of PSCs from a quiescent to an activated phenotype, using similar techniques as for pancreatic cancer cells. This project will provide important data to work towards our long-term aim to identify targets for novel therapeutic strategies in pancreatic cancer.

Despite their prevalence, the concrete functional roles of these alterations are not well understood, for two reasons: First, cancer samples tend to carry many correlated epigenetic alterations, making it difficult to statistically distinguish relevant driver events from those that co-occur for other reasons. Second, we lack tools for targeted epigenome editing that could be used to validate biological function in perturbation and rescue experiments. The proposed project strives to overcome these limitations through experimental and bioinformatic methods development, with the ambition of making and breaking cancer cells in vitro by introducing defined sets of epigenetic alterations. We will focus on leukemia as our “model cancer” (given its low mutation rate, frequent defects in epigenetic regulators, and availability of excellent functional assays), but the concepts and methods are general. In Aim 1, we will generate epigenome profiles for a human knockout cell collection comprising 100 epigenetic regulators and use the data to functionally annotate thousands of epigenetic alterations observed in large cancer datasets. In Aim 2, we will develop an experimental toolbox for epigenome programming using epigenetic drugs, CRISPR-assisted recruitment of epigenetic modifiers for locus-specific editing, and cell-derived guide RNA libraries for epigenome copying. Finally, in Aim 3 we will explore epigenome programming (methods from Aim 2) of candidate driver events (predictions from Aim 1) with the ultimate goal of converting cancer cells into non-cancer cells and vice versa. In summary, this project will establish a broadly applicable methodology and toolbox for dissecting the functional roles of epigenetic alterations in cancer. Moreover, successful creation of a cancer that is driven purely by epigenetic alterations could challenge our understanding of cancer as a genetic disease.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive histological subtype characterized by poor clinical outcome and a shortage of targeted treatment options. The hypoxia is considered as a major hallmark of TNBC, and it offers an environment which promotes selection of more aggressive and chemoresistant cells by altering the gene expression program. The alternative splicing generates transcriptome diversity and may contribute to hypoxia-induced gene expression program in TNBC. The interplay between hypoxia and alternative splicing in TNBC in largely unexplored area and needs further investigation. As epigenetics plays a crucial role in cellular response to hypoxia and alternative splicing is also regulated by epigenetic changes, it is possible that hypoxia-induced pathway regulates alternative splicing due to epigenetic modifications. We will utilize TNBC cell lines, clinical samples as well as cell line model of step-wise transformation to investigate how hypoxia-induced epigenetic changes modulate alternative splicing in TNBC. The overall aim of this proposal is to understand the hypoxia-mediated regulation of alternative pre-mRNA splicing which may contribute to tumorigenesis and chemoresistance bolstered by hypoxia in TNBC. It will help us to understand how certain individuals are more resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs than others and how hypoxia-associated alternative splicing contributes to tumorigenesis in TNBC.

At the moment, there is no screening programme for prostate cancer outside the US and current diagnostic tests are unreliable for the early stage disease, resulting in significant late presentation and resulting mortality. There are multiple genetic changes associated with prostate cancer, including mutations in p53, p21, p73 and PTEN tumour suppressor genes, but these mutations do not explain all the observed effects on gene regulation. Chromosome conformation patterns represent early changes in epigenetic regulation during tumourigenesis. A newly discovered concept of “horizontal epigenetic transfer” showed that circulating cells may acquire epigenetic properties from tumour cells. <br />In a preliminary study we have analysed blood samples of 30 age matched non-cancer controls and 45 prostate cancer patients and identified 16 chromosomal conformations that were unique to prostate cancer patients in the loci of PTEN, APC, PSMA, MYC, SAM68, SPHK1 and SMAD4 genes. This signature (identified 16 chromosomal conformations) was then validated on an anonymised independent panel of mixed patients (n=14) and controls (n=14) and identified prostate cancer patients with 85.7% sensitivity and 92.8% specificity.<br />In this project we aim to screen for chromosomal conformations in whole blood samples of 100 prostate cancer patients and healthy controls and identify further epigenetic changes correlating with tumour presence.<br />During this visit we propose to use DNA microarray to screen for 50.000 chromosomal conformations in whole blood of prostate cancer patients and compare them with those from primary tumours. Using correlated blood and tumour samples from prostate cancer patients, we plan to investigate the biological significance of the identified signatures, correlate it to gene expression and mutations (genomics) and tumour phenotype. We specifically aim to dissect tumour-specific vs paraneoplastic components of epigenetic/genetic regulators. We will identify the conformations that have a “tumour origin” and investigate their significance by comparing them with the ones identified in blood of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients and cancer-negative controls. <br />Conclusion: As a result of this project, we hope to establish a further understanding of the role and significance of chromosomal conformations in prostate cancer progression and identify chromosome epigenetic signatures indicative of cancer presence.

Diet and lifestyle factors are thought to alter the epigenetic profile of normal cells in a way which predisposes to the development of cancer. We hypothesise that the epigenetic status of normal systemic cells is predictive of breast cancer risk and that epigenetic status is influenced by diet and lifestyle. This hypothesis will be tested in a breast cancer case-control study of 1,000 women with information on diet, lifestyle, alcohol use, physical activity and clinical status. Epigenetic status will be measured in buccal cells using a genome wide scan of 25,000 promoter regions in 60 cases and 60 controls with detailed analysis of 16 selected candidate genes in all 1,000 subjects by pyrosequencing. We will determine; 1) whether the epigenetic status of healthy systemic cells is predictive of breast cancer risk, 2) which genes are epigenetically altered; 3) which lifestyle factors (e.g. diet, physical activity, BMI) are predictive of a 'high breast cancer risk' epigenetic profile?

However, the mechanism by which WBC DNA methylation associates with risk is currently unknown, but may include an accumulation of cancer risk exposures over a lifetime. ii) Aims: In this proposal we aim to perform further Epigenome-Wide Association Studies (EWAS) for important breast cancer risk exposures to gain further understanding into the mechanisms driving the epigenetic variation associated with breast cancer risk. We aim to focus on one specific risk exposure: lifetime oestrogen exposure and various factors that influence this. iii) Techniques and methodology. Using existing data on WBC DNA from >2500 female subjects from an international consortium, we will perform biostatistical analysis and modelling of DNA methylation markers associated with lifetime oestrogen exposure. A subset of these subjects will include breast cancer case-control subjects in which we will investigate the interaction with cancer risk. We will validate the association between methylation and estrogen exposure by using bisulphite pyrosequencing of 10 candidate genes in a random selection of women (n=1200 subjects) nested within EPIC-Italy, and aim to use biostatistical methods to identify potential modifiers (lifestyle and environmental factors) of estrogen exposure in all women enrolled in EPIC-Italy (n=18,500 subjects). iv) Impact on breast cancer research. If successful this would greatly improve our ability to measure lifetime oestrogen exposures and estimate an individual’s risk associated with this exposure. Furthermore, if we can identify environmental or lifestyle factors that modify the epigenetic signature associated with this risk exposure, we may identify novel methods of prevention and risk reduction.

Canonical nucleobases encode the identity of all RNAs and proteins that are synthesized by a cell, whereas epigenetic nucleobases regulate this synthesis. This regulation shapes the phenotype of cells, and its perturbation is a key trigger of cancer. Canonical nucleobases can be decoded in a programmable manner by nucleic acids and their analogs via Watson-Crick-base pairing, and the simplicity of this recognition has enabled revolutionary developments in the biological sciences. In contrast, comparable developments in epigenetics have not yet been possible, since a molecular scaffold with programmable recognition of epigenetic nucleobases does not exist. We will establish the first class of molecules capable of the expanded programmable recognition of both canonical and epigenetic DNA nucleobases in vitro and in vivo. This is based on transcription-activator-like effectors (TALEs) that consist of four types of concatenated modules, each of which recognizes a canonical nucleobase. We have recently reported the detection of single epigenetic nucleobases by TALEs. In this project, we will 1. engineer a toolbox of TALE modules with selectivity for C, mC, hmC, fC, and caC, 2. employ them for TALE-based in vitro typing and profiling (reading) of cancer biomarker mC/hmC, and 3. design photoactivatable TALE-fusions that enable the writing and erasing of mC at user-defined genomic loci in vivo with spatiotemporal resolution. This will provide the first insights into the dynamic effects of de novo editing on chromatin regulation, and enables the imprinting of regulatory states. Given the central role of epigenetic nucleobases in cancer and the universality of our approach, this project will provide enabling and broadly applicable methodology for cancer epigenetics research, diagnosis and therapy.

Approximately 42,000 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer each year in the UK. The best non-invasive PCa biomarker, PSA, is relatively inaccurate with a sensitivity of 21% for all cancers and 51% for high grade disease, meaning approximately 76% or 126,000 men who have a raised PSA do not have prostate cancer. Therefore, a significant proportion of men undergo highly invasive, expensive and unnecessary biopsy to rule out the presence of disease. The development of a non-invasive epigenetic assay, has the potential to remove the uncertainty surrounding PSA testing and improve both diagnosis and treatment of men with prostate cancer (PCa). We have developed a highly multiplexed targeted sequencing assay (PACEB) to detect prostate cancer specific epigenetic alterations in cfDNA of men with this dieseas. The PACEB assay utilizes 177 epigenetically altered loci which has can discriminate PCa from normal prostate with a high degree of accuracy, and which isn&rsquo;t affected by tumour heterogeneity. The aim of this project is to show the potential clinical utility of an epigenetic cell free DNA assay to rule out the presence prostate cancer in men with a raised PSA. The use of cancer specific epigenetic biomarker has the potential to reduce the uncertainty surrounding PSA testing and decrease the number of unnecessary, invasive and expensive biopsies in men who do not have disease. It will also improve treatment by allowing the non-invasive monitoring of disease recurrence and response therapy, reducing the need for frequent, expensive imaging and allowing earlier intervention in men with progressive disease.

Characterizations of the molecular mechanisms involved in this process are of utmost medical importance, because they may identify targets for CRPC treatment, which currently has no curative therapy available. Our preliminary data suggest that TRIM24 has a unique role in supporting CRPC growth. We will also identify the molecular targets of TRIM24 in CRPC by using androgen-dependent and CRPC model cell lines. Integration of these targets with gene expression datasets from prostate cancer patients will determine how TRIM24 drives CRPC growth. Our main hypothesis is that TRIM24 directly anchors AR at novel gene targets in CRPC and thereby mediates its ligand-independent transactivation and growth. However, by determining TRIM24-mediated gene expression programs in CRPC in an unbiased and genome-wide manner, we do not limit ourselves to this model, allowing us to identify other critical pathways involved in prostate cancer progression. We hope that this molecular characterization will help us deepen our understanding of disease progression and will shed light on new potential therapeutic targets in CRPC.

While localized prostate cancer is highly curable, nearly all patients with metastatic disease progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer for which there are presently limited treatment options. Thus, there is high need to develop selective, context-dependent therapeutic strategies to manage metastatic prostate cancer. The identification of the pathways that, in a specific tumor context, lead to disease progression and metastasis is an important step in developing more effective treatments based on the tumor molecular and biological characteristics.The overall goal of this SSAJRP application is to combine and integrate the expertise of the participating groups at two leading Institutions in Switzerland (IOR) and in South Africa (ICGEB) to improve the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in tumor progression and to discover novel therapeutic approaches for a specific subtype of prostate cancers, ERG fusion positive tumors. The participating teams have long term experience in prostate cancer biology, genomics and experimental therapeutics and, along with the excellent facilities and resources available in the respective Institutions, constitute an unique work environment to perform this project with high relevant basic, translational and clinical implications. Furthermore, this bilateral project will provide an ideal platform and framework for training students and young scientists in an international setting in both countries. Gene fusions involving the ETS transcription factor ERG are found in about half of prostate cancers. The gene fusion determine overexpression of full length ERG in prostate epithelial cells. Pre-clinical and clinical data sustain the notion that activation of multiple oncogenic pathways cooperating with ERG is required for progression of ERG fusion positive tumors. However, the molecular details of these interactions are not defined yet. Understanding these mechanisms would be important for the development of more effective therapies. We have recently discovered a novel mechanism leading to aberrant activation of ERG and contributing to prostate cancer progression. We identified EZH2, a key epigenetic effector, as an important element enhancing the oncogenic activity of ERG and at the center of cross-talks between ERG and the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway in prostate cancer. We found that EZH2 enhances ERG transcriptional activity, forms with ERG co-activator and co-repressor complexes, and thus contributes to transcriptional reprogramming and acquisition of tumorigenic and metastatic properties. Notably, the genes co-occupied and co-regulated by ERG and EZH2 constitute a gene signature predictive of adverse prognosis and highly enriched in metastatic prostate cancers. Furthermore, we showed that antagonizing the ERG and EZH2 interaction with EZH2 targeting agents could be highly effective to treat patients with aggressive ERG positive tumors. The studies proposed in this application will address the role of ERG in orchestrating and remodeling the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape in prostate tumors by examining the network of co-regulatory factors co-opted by the ERG/EZH2 complexes to activate the pro-tumorigenic and pro-metastatic program. To this end, we plan to integrate molecular, genomic and functional studies in vitro and in vivo with human patient data to understand the events involved in the cross-talks between ERG, EZH2 and transcriptional co-regulators and to examine the biological and clinical consequences. Furthermore, we will examine strategies aimed at reversing ERG pro-tumorigenic/pro-metastatic program by targeting the key components of the ERG-orchestrated epigenetic network. Accordingly, the specific aims of the present applications are: Aim 1. To understand the molecular mechanisms of the ERG-orchestrated transcriptional reprogramming and tumor progression in ERG positive prostate cancer. Aim 2. To explore therapeutic approaches to reverse ERG-dependent reprogramming and progression in prostate cancer. Collectively, the combination of genomic, molecular and functional in vitro and in vivo studies proposed in this SSAJRP application will lead to a deeper understanding of the biological mechanisms leading to transformation and progression in ERG-dependent prostate cancers. Furthermore, these studies will reveal therapeutically actionable pathways whose modulation could have a broad impact on the management of prostate cancer.

83	Carlo Catapano	Università della Svizzera italiana	Istituto di Ricerca in Biomedicina (IRB)	2014-04-01	2017-03-31	Promoter-proximal long non-coding RNAs and epigenetic regulatory networks in prostate cancer	Recent advances in molecular oncology indicate that, in addition to genetic changes, like mutations and deletions, an extensive reprogramming of the epigenetic landscape occurs during cancer development and progression. Epigenetic processes, including DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications and chromatin remodeling, contribute to the pathogenesis of human cancers and impact on disease progression, treatment responses and clinical outcome. A large portion of the human genome encodes long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) including lncRNAs generated in intergenic regions and promoter-associated noncoding RNAs (paRNAs) adjacent to protein-coding genes. LncRNAs comprise an heterogeneous population of transcripts many of which likely exert important epigenetic regulatory functions. We have shown that promoter-proximal lncRNAs can establish and maintain the transcriptional silent and active states of genes in cancer cells. However, the extent and complexity of the potential RNA-based regulatory networks created by paRNAs and their involvement in human cancer are still to be defined. We hypothesize that RNA-based epigenetic regulatory networks might represent a widespread mechanism to control gene expression with a relevant impact on cancer development and progression. Furthermore, promoter-proximal lncRNAs controlling key cancer genes represent targetable elements of the epigenetic apparatus for therapeutic modulation of gene expression. Accordingly, the overall goal of this project is to define the role of promoter-proximal lncRNAs in controlling transcriptional silencing and activation of key cancer genes and the diverse mechanisms by which they exert these functions. We will focus initially on the novel mechanism of transcriptional regulation of the CDH1 tumor suppressor gene by bidirectional paRNAs that we have uncovered. In parallel, we will explore similar RNA-based networks in other genes using genome-wide approaches. We expect that this will lead to the identification of other relevant genes in prostate tumors similarly regulated and targetable by RNAi-based transcriptional approaches. To this end, we plan to analyze public Next Generation Sequencing databases containing RNA-seq data to identify promoter-associated transcripts in genes deregulated in prostate cancer and establish their relation with transcriptional gene silencing or activation. RNA-seq data will be validated experimentally by qRT-PCR in normal and cancer cell lines. Furthermore, normal and prostate tumor tissue samples will be examined to establish the relevance of these findings in clinical human samples. Our goal is to link specific patterns of sense and antisense paRNAs with promoter state and transcriptional activity of the genes. Analysis of clinical samples and human normal and prostate cancer cell lines representing different stages of the disease will provide additional hints of the role of the paRNAs and deregulated target genes in prostate tumorigenesis. We will include in the study also normal and cancer cells engineered to model over-expression and down-regulation of specific oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes to further link altered paRNA/gene expression patterns to the molecular and biological characteristics of prostate tumors.To understand the biological relevance of the identified paRNAs will perform knockdown experiments and evaluate the consequences on target gene expression. To uncover the mechanism by which paRNAs exert these function we will perform knockdown experiments along with additional functional assays, including RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), RNA-ChIP and biotin-labeled RNA pull-down. Promoter reporter and expression vectors will be generated as tools to further define the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by paRNAs. RNA sequencing experiments of nuclear RNA fraction will assist in the identification of small RNAs and microRNAs that might be involved in interactions of paRNAs with protein partners like Argonautes. Furthermore, we will test the hypothesis that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) mapping in non-coding regions and gene promoters might induce inter-individual and allele-specific differences in transcriptional activity of protein-coding genes by perturbing the epigenetic functions of paRNAs through modifications of their primary sequence and/or secondary structure. Finally, we will explore the potential of RNAi-based transcriptional modulation to affect the cancer cell phenotype. We will focus specifically on key genes whose modulation might affect preferentially stem-like and tumor-initiating properties of cancer cells and determine the effects of RNAi-mediated transcriptional silencing or activation in vitro and in vivo. Our genome-wide approach might discover new targets with potential important functions in tumor initiation and progression that will be tested using these approaches. Collectively, the studies will provide novel insights into fundamental biological mechanisms of gene regulation and the basis for development of novel therapeutic strategies.

Among those, actinic keratoses (AKs) are intraepithelial lesions that develop on sun-exposed surfaces of the skin such as the face, scalp or lower arms. These lesions result from UV-induced alterations in the epidermal part of the skin, and more specifically in keratinocytes. AKs may develop into invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (SCC) which is the second most common form of skin cancer worldwide. It is thus a major source of morbidity and cost overall. The incidence (number of new cases arising in a given period expressed as a rate per 100,000 persons per year) for SCC over the last 40 years is increasing at an impressive pace in Western European countries and particularly in Switzerland. Switzerland has the highest SCC incidence rate among all countries in mainland Europe. It has also the fastest increase from 14.2/100 000 person-years in 1978 to 28.9/100 000 person-years in 1997 and keeps increasing in numbers, both medically and economically.Some populations are at a greatly elevated risk for SCC of the skin. Organ transplant recipients (OTRs) achieve maintenance of their graft by immunosuppressive medication which suppresses transplant rejection. Calcineurin inhibition is the cornerstone of most immunosuppressive regimes. This success of modern transplantation medicine is, however, countered by an increased cancer risk in this population. SCC is the most frequent complication in organ transplant recipients at a risk increased 60- to 100-fold compared to the general population. SCC in OTR is characterized by a higher risk of metastasis in up to 20% of cases and shows a more aggressive course than SCC in the general population. Not infrequently, successfully transplanted patients suffer a great burden in their quality of life and sometimes even a vital threat by the formation of SCC. The commonly used calcineurin inhibitor, cyclosporine A (CsA), directly induces tumor growth in murine models and in humans via transcription factor ATF3 and increases the secretion of transforming growth factor-ß and vascular endothelia growth factor conductive to SCC formation. While some mechanisms for this greatly increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin have been elucidated, open questions remain. However, not all patients undergoing immunosuppressive treatment develop SCC, some are heavily affected, others hardly. Therefore, this project proposes to integrate transcriptome with epigenetic and functional analysis to understand genetic predisposition to cancer, with SCC in OTR as a focus. Generally, the possible role of genetic/epigenetic modifications of gene networks in SCC predisposition is largely unexplored. Thus, identifying patient- and tumor-specific differences will provide a comprehensive landscape of actionable targets. As a consequence, this expanding knowledge has implications for all aspects of cancer management, including prevention, screening, and treatment.We will address two main aims: 1)To test the hypothesis that different susceptibility of OTR patients to skin SCC is linked to different expression of genes with key regulatory function in keratinocytes and skin homeostasis.2)To assess in primary keratinocytes derived from OTRs the difference in their tumor forming/yielding capability in a manner that can be explained by different genetic and/or epigenetic control of key regulatory genes.

This heterogeneity results in inconsistent and unpredictable therapeutic response. Large genomic studies have allowed a comprehensive exploration of the genetic and epigenetic bases of cancer. However, the quantity and variety of modifications observed severely challenge the identification of the few events that are functional and ultimately can be targeted for therapy. Finally, cancer phenotypes are determined by more than one functional event acting in concert, and these genetic contexts determine prognosis and treatment response. The overall goal of this project is to identify functional and actionable sets of molecular alterations, here termed signatures, to design therapeutic protocols matching drug combinations with genetically defined tumor classes.The proposed research builds on computational biology and cancer genomics work from our group [1, 2, 3] and the largest collection of cancer genomes from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) including 11144 tumors from 33 cancer types. This dataset has been only recently finalized and as a group leader in the consortium, we are in a unique position to access this data and successfully pursue the proposed goals. The project’s aims are:AIM 1: From thousands of molecular alterations to selected functional events in cancer. Here, we will distill a set of selected functional events integrating genetic and epigenetic modifications. We will complement analyses of copy number changes and mutations with a novel approach to determine aberrant patterns of DNA methylation. Finally, we will integrate multiple types of events to identify signatures of alterations characteristic of tumor subclasses and reflecting distinct oncogenic mechanisms (oncogenic signatures). AIM 2: From oncogenic selected events to therapeutically actionable targets. Here, we will classify genetic and epigenetic events as therapeutically actionable and/or response-associated to selected drug compounds. We will integrate this classification into the context of signatures to map clinically relevant events with single or drug combinations in well characterized molecular contexts. This approach will ultimately generate hypotheses testable in the laboratory.AIM 3: From therapeutic targets to actionable signatures: a new paradigm to harness tumor interdependencies. Here, we will identify human tumor subclasses characterized by signatures of clinically relevant events. We will analyze these classes at different levels of granularity to account for functionally similar alterations and compounds. We will nominate actionable signatures predictive of drug response in specific genetic contexts and establish a framework for pre-clinical therapeutic studies. Results from this project will demonstrate the potential of combining systematic analyses based on actionable alterations across large tumor cohorts to design therapeutic protocols tailored to specific patient populations.

86	Ueli Grossniklaus	University of Zurich	Institut für Pflanzen- und Mikrobiologie Universität Zürich	2012-05-01	2015-04-30	The Genetic and Molecular Basis of Gametogenesis and Maternal Effects in Arabidopsis	Gametogenesis and the maternal control of embryogenesis have been studied extensively in animal systems at the genetic, molecular, and cellular level. These studies have yielded insight into fundamental concepts and mechanism involved in the establishment and interpretation of positional information, cell-cell interaction, and signal transduction cascades. In contrast, our knowledge about genetic and molecular control of these processes in plants is very limited. The simple but highly polar and specialized female gametophyte, which consists of only seven cells belonging to four cell types, make it an ideal system to study the role of positional information and signaling during development. Using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model system, this proposal focuses on the elucidation of key events during sexual reproduction, namely cell specification, fertilization, and the epigenetic control of seed development with a focus on embryogenesis. We will use a combination of (quantitative) genetic, cell biological, molecular, and computational approaches. Many of the methods are established in the laboratory and rely on standard genetic and molecular biology protocols. Others need special adaptations and have been optimized for the study of the elusive and inaccessible female gametophyte. However, also novel experimental approaches will be established and adapted to our system, such as (i) methods to investigate sister chromatid segregation, (ii) network analyses of cell type-specific transcriptomes; (iii) novel cloning approaches using next generation sequencing technology, (iv) genome-wide association studies to identify modifier loci, and (v) the development of genetic and transgenic tools to investigate embryogenesis uninfluenced by the endosperm. The experiments described in this proposal will shed light on fundamental aspects of plant development, such as the role of positional information, cell-cell interactions, signal transduction, and epigenetic gene regulation in development. Thus, they span numerous fields of developmental biology and will yield novel insights into developmental control mechanisms that transcend plant biology. For example, epigenetic mechanisms play an important role in growth and development. While the role of epigenetic gene regulation in cancer and disease has only become apparent over the last years, plant researchers have studied epigenetic phenomena for decades and have contributed much to our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms.

Cancer cells are characterized by a complex interplay between genetic and epigenetic abnormalities that drive the evolution of the malignancy. Epigenetic influences not only gene expression but also telomeres function as well as genomic stability. Epigenetic of pNETs is poorly understood. Mutations in DAXX (Death associated protein 6) or ATRX (ATR-X gene) with correspondent loss of proteins expression occur in 40% of pNETs. DAXX and ATRX negative tumors show ALT (Alternative Lengthening Telomeres) activation a mechanism for telomeres length maintenance, telomerase independent. We have recently shown that loss of DAXX or ATRX predicts for poor disease outcome and that DAXX/ATRX negative tumors show chromosomal instability. DAXX and ATRX regulate the epigenetic status of the cells by mediating both chromatin structure organization and DNA methylation. Preliminary results obtained in our group indicate that DAXX/ATRX negative tumors show a lower level of global DNA methylation compared to positive ones. I hypothesize that DAXX/ATRX loss in pNETs induces an epigenetic reprogramming affecting gene expression as well as telomeres functions and genomic instability. These epigenetic abnormalities may drive the evolution of this subtype of tumors. In the current proposal I aim to: 1. Describe a specific epigenetic profile of DAXX/ATRX negative and ALT positive tumors2. Identify epigenetically regulated players of DAXX/ATRX negative pNETs development and validate their expression 3. Assess the capacity of the identified candidates to mediate response to anti-tumoral treatment. DNA-methylation arrays will be performed on 50 pNET human samples. Methylation profiles will be integrated with gene, miRNA and LncRNA expression data obtained on 30 samples respectively by gene expression arrays and Nanostring technology. Expression of interesting candidates found to be dysregulated from the comparative analysis will be validated on additional samples by Immunohistochemiestry, qRT-PCR and RNA in situ hybridization. Primary cells derived from pNET patients will be treated with different drugs currently in use for pNETs treatment as well as DNA demethylating agents and when possible with drugs targeting the new identified dysregulated pathways. This project will shed light into pancreatic neuro-endocrine tumorigeneisis mechanisms and may lead to the identification of new important therapeutic options.

When detected at an early stage, the majority of cancers can be cured with current treatment modalities. However, most cancers present at an advanced stage. The discovery of sensitive and specific biomarkers may improve preclinical diagnosis of primary or recurrent colorectal cancer, and holds the promise of prognostic and could be important for therapeutic management. Epigenetic alterations that initiate and drive tumorigenesis are promising targets because they may precede clinically obvious cancers, can be detected at sensitive levels, may be specific to tumor cells, and can potentially provide information about prognosis and treatment. It is now evident that aberrant DNA methylation observed in cancer cells is not restricted to a few CpG islands, but affects multiple loci. Determination of the methylation patterns of multiple genes (epigenetic profiling) to obtain complex DNA methylation signatures appears promising in order to better understanding colorectal cancer biology and to identify new molecular markers in a way to improve treatment and prevention strategies.A key challenge in clinical oncology is the identification of sensitive and specific biomarkers for early detection of cancer. For early and non-invasive detection of cancer, the analysis of nucleic acid markers in the blood of patients should provide useful tools for diagnostic developments. Many authors have suggested the possible utility of the analysis of cell-free tumor-derived nucleic acids in plasma. Analyzing methylation of DNA purified from plasma offers several advantages compared to other potential biomarkers. DNA methylation, which is a covalent modification of cytosines, is chemically stable and thus, contrary to markers like circulating proteins or RNAs, its analysis is less sensitive to the storage conditions of biological samples. Reactivation of telomerase is a necessary event for the sustained growth of most human tumors. Our previous studies showed that reactivation of telomerase may occur through hypermethylation of the hTERT promoter in the quasi totality of colorectal tumors. Therefore, epigenetic change of the hTERT promoter could become a powerful biomarker for early diagnosis of colorectal cancers. The aims of this study are to better define the methylation profile of colorectal cancers and determine whether methylation of some promoter genes, e.g. hTERT, could become biomarkers for early diagnosis and follow-up of patients with a colorectal cancer. In a way to answer the intended aims of our project, 4 interdependent researches will be carried out during this study: 1) to identify new potential epigenetic biomarkers in colorectal cancers. Differential DNA methylation patterns in colon cancer versus normal colon will be investigated using Affymetrix Promoter Tilling Arrays and new approaches for enrichment of methylated DNA 2) to analyze evolution of methylation profiling during colorectal carcinogenesis. A newly developed promoter methylation macroarray, named methylation ligation-dependent macroarray (MLM), will be used. This macroarray will be built with some of the candidate genes identified in the methylation array. 3) to define the potential of hTERT methylation to become a powerful biomarker for early colorectal cancer diagnosis using plasma DNA. 4) to define the potential of some of the newly identify methylated promoter genes to become epigenetic biomarkers for early diagnosis and follow-up of colorectal cancer patients.

Accumulating evidence suggests a similar role for mutation of epigenetic regulators in solid tumors. In prostate cancer, we discovered a genetically defined subclass of tumors characterized by point-mutations in SPOP (speckle-type POZ protein, a substrate-binding subunit of an E3 ubiquitin ligase) and deletions in CHD1 (chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 1). These alterations conceivably alter chromatin-related biological processes such as cell differentiation and genomic stability. However, the precise roles these mutated genes play in tumorigenesis, and any therapeutic implications, remain elusive. This proposal aims (i) to establish disease-relevant cell culture models for SPOP and CHD1-mutated tumors in order to (ii) study the biological function of these newly discovered mutations and (iii) to design therapeutic strategies for this new subtype of prostate cancer.

They are notorious for their escape from therapy attributed to the multitude of affected pathways, acquisition of tumor stem cell properties and tumor heterogeneity. It has become clear that single agent therapies systematically fail in this disease and new strategies for targeted combination therapies are urgently needed. The dependency of cancer cells on the interplay between aberrant changes of the epigenetic landscape and genetic alterations is rapidly emerging. Key elements associated with deregulation of gene expression have been associated with epigenetic reprogramming comprising epigenetic silencing of key genes mediated by DNA methylation and modulation of chromatin. These new insights need to be followed upon and translated into new treatment strategies. First, pathways affected by epigenetic alterations are potentially targetable and second, interference with the epigenetic machinery may allow reprogramming the epigenome - both strategies seem promising and require respective research. In this proposal we aim at addressing the question of functional contribution of the epigenetic landscape to the malignant behaviour of GBM in order to identify novel drug combination strategies for personalized therapy. In Project A we aim at targeting epigenetic regulation in tumors. The clinical development of potent inhibitors of chromatin “readers”, namely bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) proteins that seem to be promising targets in hematopoietic malignancies, and potentially also in solid tumours including gliomas.- A first in class drug (OTX015) is now tested in an international phase I/II trial in recurrent GBM in which we participate. - Our approach aims at disturbing the system by using BET inhibitors, identify disturbed pathways which we hypothesize should be informative for potential vulnerabilities that may be targeted with a second drug. The project entails (i) identification of gene expression signatures induced by BET inhibitors; (ii) mapping of the genomic location of key histone modifications, and of key members of BET protein signalling (BRD4, MED1) in GBM derived sphere lines that retain cancer stem cell like properties, using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq); (iii) Integration of the acquired data with publically available cell-line / drug response data to propose targets and respective compounds to be combined with BET inhibitors; (iv) followed by rigorous validation of these predictions using a targeted ShRNA-screen and functional analyses in our in vitro sphere line models and in patient-derived xenografts. This integrated effort is expected to yield a number of combination therapies and respective biomarkers that will be further translated to our existing clinical trial networks.In Project B we entertain the question whether epigenetic/genetic profiles imply distinct treatment approaches based on the pathways they affect - with the specific question of epigenetic differences in GBM of elderly patients whose tumors are poorly characterized. Elderly GBM patients represent a growing patient population who are frequently excluded from clinical trials. For this purpose we have determined the methylome and gene copy alterations in a clinical trial population of elderly GBM patients (n=130), which we confront to our dataset from an adult GBM trial population (n>200), and external datasets. This data will also serve as input into Project A of this proposal.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div. I-III)	510323.0	CHF

Hence, we plan to study the correlation between alternative-splicing and epigenetic markers in a colorectal cancer tissue series. We will supplement and validate the methods and tools we develop using the rich datasets from the ENCODE and Epigenome Roadmap projects.

Large scale sequencing studies have implicated increasing numbers of transcription factors (TFs), chromatin modifiers and histones as direct targets of mutations and rearrangements in cancer. These genetic alterations are now recognized to play critical roles in cellular transformation by altering key transcriptional programs involved in cellular differentiation, plasticity and proliferation. The detailed characterization of these alterations requires the coordinated analysis of aberrant transcriptional regulators and their effects at large numbers of sites across the genome. This task can be facilitated by two recent developments: the use of chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing to map protein-DNA interactions (ChIP-seq) and the definition of a ‘histone code’ of post-translational histone modifications associated with the activation state of regulatory elements. This combination allow the comprehensive identification of the chromatin landscape (‘epigenome’) of a given cell type across the genome. Signature chromatin structures can then be used to identify promoters, transcripts, enhancers, silencers and repressive chromatin domains. They also inform on the regulatory state assumed by a given DNA element in a specific cell type or developmental state. These advances have been particularly important for the genome-wide identification of enhancer elements, revealing their primordial role for a large number of regulatory events in transcription and their strong link to cell identity. Similar approaches based on the analysis of chromatin marks on a genome-wide scale have great potential for elucidating the contributions of altered transcriptional regulation to cancer. The impact of such epigenetic changes in cancer may be particularly relevant in two functional contexts: the establishment and maintenance of intratumoral cellular heterogeneity and hierarchy, and the identification of the regulatory network driving tumor initiation and progression by single genetic oncogenic events.The presence of an intratumoral hierarchy governing cellular differentiation and tumor initiating potential, as well as the associated epigenetic mechanisms are increasingly appreciated to play key roles in at least a subset of cancer types. Haematopoietic malignancies as well as a growing number of solid tumors have been now shown to contain a subpopulation of cells possessing tumor initiating capability and stem cell properties, including expression of embryonic stem cell genes and self-renewal potential. These cells, termed cancer stem cells (CSC), are generally believed to represent the tumor re-populating force, preserving their own numbers through self-renewal, and generating a more differentiated progeny that composes the bulk of the tumor. In addition to providing a driving force for tumor growth and maintenance, CSC may be more resistant to conventional anti-cancer therapy, consistent with their presumed role in relapse following therapy. Accordingly, CSC transcriptional signatures are highly predictive of overall patient survival supporting their clinical relevance. It follows that attempts to increase therapeutic effectiveness in tumors with a documented cellular hierarchy should include strategies that target not only rapidly dividing bulk and progenitor cells, but CSC as well. Since CSC share the same genetic alterations with the more differentiated cancer cells to which they give rise, it is believed that their defining properties are rooted in their epigenetic state. In keeping with this, a better understanding of the regulatory circuitries sustaining CSC-specific transcriptional programs and plasticity within primary tumors is a critical goal with broad implications for therapy.Some types of cancer, including a subset of pediatric sarcomas, can display only a single detectable oncogenic event, usually in the form of a non-random reciprocal chromosomal translocation. Chromosomal translocations that constitute a phenotypic signature of defined tumor types commonly generate a functional fusion gene believed to initiate tumor development. The majority of genes involved in chromosomal translocations encode transcription factors and transcriptional regulators, not surprisingly then, the resulting fusion protein behave as aberrant transcription factors that drive transformation by altering the gene expression repertoire of permissive precursor cells. For transformation and subsequent tumor initiation to occur, the corresponding fusion protein should be able to generate the appropriate epigenetic landscape either by exploiting a primary cellular microenvironment that is permissive for expression of its oncogenic properties or by an initial transcriptional reprogramming of primary target cells to render them permissive for its subsequent transforming activity. The study of malignancies that appear to harbor a single initiating oncogenic event therefore offers a particularly attractive means to address the possible mechanisms whereby an single driver oncogenic event can induce tumor development through reprogramming of the transcriptional landscape of primary cells. This notion is particularly evident in pediatric cancers, where specific genetic alterations may represent the sole event in tumor initiation. Pediatric tumors present therefore unique opportunities to characterize the transcriptional impact of oncogenic lesions in relative isolation from the complex genomic aberrations typical of adult malignancies.During the past 3 years our group developed a research program focusing on two distinct aspects of epigenetic reprogramming in cancer: the analysis of the transcriptional programs governing cellular hierarchies in primary human tumors, and the molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis and tumor progression driven by single aberrant transcription factors in pediatric sarcomas. In the first approach glioma CSC models were used to identify a core set of neurodevelopmental TFs that are critical for GBM propagation, and sufficient to fully reprogram differentiated GBM cells into ‘induced’ CSCs that recapitulate the epigenetic landscape and phenotype of native CSCs. The second line of investigation allowed us to identify primary cells from which selected sarcomas develop and to make a number of contributions to the field. In particular we have recently characterized the direct mechanisms of action of EWS-FLI1, an aberrant TF driving Ewing sarcoma development. Pursuing the coordinated analysis of chromatin states at EWS-FLI1 binding sites in Ewing sarcoma primary tumors, cell lines and precursor pediatric mesenchymal stem cells we uncovered distinct roles for EWS-FLI1 in enhancer activation and repression, dictated by the underlying DNA sequence and critical to maintain the tumor state. The goal of this research proposal is to pursue these two successful lines of investigation, applying similar experimental approaches to additional relevant cellular and tumor models. In a first set of experiments, using a well-established model of primary CSC from the pediatric tumor neuroblastoma (NB), we plan to identify epigenetic determinants that distinguish CSCs from their differentiated progeny. In a second set of experiments we will take advantage of our previous works on sarcomas to establish the global chromatin landscape of two aggressive childhood malignancies driven by single transforming oncogenic events, and to determine the involvement of epigenetic-mediated gene regulatory mechanisms in tumor initiation and development. These two distinct but complementary approaches should provide a novel view of the molecular pathways driving the emergence and progression of genetically-defined pediatric tumours, and have the potential to offer new therapeutic targets to improve their clinical management.

Failure or abnormal presence of such epigenetic marks is often reported in several diseases including cancer. Our laboratory is focusing on the function of de novo DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, using B-cell development as a model. For this purpose we use conditional knockout mice for both Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b and have analyzed the role of these two enzymes in survival and long term maintenance of B-cell lineage. Indeed we found that in the absence of these two enzymes B-cell precursors are defective in proliferation in vitro, undergo apoptosis and also have deregulated gene expression profiles. By performing bisulfite sequencing we could provide evidences of altered methylation patterns in the promoter and non-promoter regions of some of the B lineage specific or cell type specific genes, for example Rag-2, a gene essential for the recombination of immunoglobulin heavy and light chain locus. Interestingly, activated mature B-cells lacking Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b appeared to be slightly skewed towards plasma cell differentiation. Together our data suggest a general phenomenon of DNA methylation-mediated regulation of inter- and intra-cellular molecular pathways which might also be applicable to other similar cell types, for example T-cells under immune activation. In our current proposal, we would like to test this hypothesis further and as well as characterize in detail the precise mechanism by which both Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b regulate gene expression, process of lineage commitment and also the maintenance of cellular integrity. For this purpose we plan to apply genomic and proteomic strategies and investigate the direct and indirect targets of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b during cellular differentiation setups. We anticipate discovering novel sets of genes, signaling networks and regulatory factors that might have implications in understanding both fundamental biological mechanisms underlying DNA methylation and influence of DNA methylation in immune cell function.

These target genes are usually regulated by transcription factors that can act as oncoproteins or tumor suppressors. Kevin Struhl’s (K.S.) laboratory has developed an inducible cell-culture model to transform human breast epithelial cells into cancer stem cells (CSCs). This transformation involves an epigenetic switch in response to a transient inflammatory signal. This epigenetic switch is mediated by a positive feedback loop, which involves the transcription factor NF-kB, a Lin28 microRNA regulator, the Let-7 microRNA, and interleukin 6. Furthermore, this transformation process which is relevant in many forms of human cancer, is dependent on the transcriptional co-activators ß-catenin, YAP/TAZ, and S100A9/A8 that are targets of Wnt, Hippo, and calcium signaling, respectively. The central goal of my proposal is to elucidate, on a whole-genome scale, the transcriptional regulatory circuits and underlying molecular mechanisms that are involved in the processes of cellular transformation and the formation of cancer stem cells. First, I will identify direct and indirect targets of the co-activators ß-catenin, YAP/TAZ, and S100A9/A8 by using standard proteomics and genomics approaches (immuoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, ChIP-seq, and mRNA profiling). Notably, K.S. has already identified WDR77 and the arginine methylase PRMT5 to interact with ß-catenin. He also found that components of the polyadenylation machinery interact with YAP/TAZ. Based on that, I will secondly examine whether and how these proteins mediate transformation of epithelial cells into CSCs by interacting with ß-catenin and YAP/TAZ. Third, I will undertake a systematic structure-function analysis of mutant derivatives of these co-activators to examine which biological functions are necessary and sufficient for transformation. These derivatives will be essential for identifying oncogenically-relevant target genes. In summary, I propose to use this integrated set of genetic and functional genomic experiments on an inducible model of transformation and CSC formation to elucidate fundamental mechanisms in cancer progression at the molecular level. These discoveries will ultimately lead to the identification of new pathways and potential targets for therapy of cancer.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Early Postdoc.Mobility	None	None

This variable property is a defining aspect of a cell’s identity and is mainly interpreted at the level of epigenetic signature and chromatin organization. A complex epigenetic network, which includes the coordinated action of histone modifying enzymes, DNA methyltransferases and non-coding RNAs regulate cell functions throughout a person’s lifetime and establish the blueprint for the tissues of the developing embryo. Consequently, each cell has its own epigenetic pattern that must be carefully established and maintained to regulate proper gene expression. Perturbations in these carefully arranged patterns can lead to congenital disorders or predispose people to acquire disease states. Primary goals over the next decade will include improving our understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms and gene expression in physiological and pathological conditions, with the aim to create the basis for the development of therapeutic strategies directed at a wide variety of diseases, including cancer. In the past decade, long non-coding (lnc)RNAs have gained widespread attention as a potentially new and crucial layer of biological regulation. lncRNAs of all kinds have been implicated in a range of developmental processes and diseases, and in the regulation of a variety of epigenetic mechanisms leading to the establishment of chromatin conformation and epigenetic patterns that ultimately result in the fine control of genes. However, knowledge of the mechanisms by which lncRNAs act is still limited. In this project we aim to dissect epigenetic regulatory systems that contribute to the establishment of heterochromatin, a highly condensed chromosomal domain whose role has been implicated in genome stability and transcriptional gene silencing. Specifically, we will analyse the role of the nucleolar chromatin repressor TIP5 and the non-coding RNA pRNA in the regulation of nucleolar heterochromatin structure during embryonic stem cell differentiation. The results of this project will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms that cells use to program their identity through chromatin and epigenetic modifications. Moreover, these studies will provide important insights into the dynamic nature of chromatin, offering basic principles of genome organization, gene regulation and cell function as well as a clear understanding of the development of chromatin and epigenetic related-diseases like cancer, which will be instrumental for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

97	Patricia Waszyk	University of Lausanne	Institut Universitaire de Pathologie CHUV	2015-11-01	2018-10-31	Epigenetic mechanisms regulating Ewing's sarcoma cancer stem cell properties	There is increasing evidence that epigenetics play a major role in tumors by regulating gene expression and thus increasing cell capacity of self-renewal and proliferation, without altering the primary DNA sequence. Three types of epigenetic alterations are currently believed to be causally implicated in providing cancer cells with the ability to drive tumor growth and progression, namely DNA methylation, chromatin remodelling as a result of covalent histone modifications and non-coding RNAs, particularly microRNAs (miRNA). Precise understanding of such mechanisms may help identify a set of targets for the development of new therapeutic strategies.The cancer stem cell (CSC) model was revived in recent years with the notion that a tumor initiating cell acquires increased self-renewal capacity through genetic mutations and epigenetic modification, maintaining the tumor drive indefinitely. CSC express various embryonic stem cell genes, including CD133, often used a stem cell marker. CSC are capable to reproduce the original tumor in vivo upon injection in immunocompromised mice, thereby giving birth to heterogenous cell subpopulations, composed of CSC as well as more differentiated progeny. As they are more prone to chemotherapy resistance, it can be conceived that targeting and eradicating CSC may lead to cure of cancers in which CSC provide the driving force for growth and progression.In the case of Ewing’s sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT), a group of rare but highly aggressive tumors arising in mesenchymal tissue in children and young adults, conventional chemotherapies are not sufficient to effectively treat patients and prevent relapse, primarily due to early metastasis. 85% of ESFT present a single mutation, the translocation t(11;22), leading to the formation of an aberrant fusion protein EWS-FLI1.The epigenetic state of primary cells is believed to determine whether they may or may not be permissive for oncogene-induced transformation. Thus, in depth understanding of epigenetically regulated cell permissiveness for oncogene expression and the mechanisms that regulate epigenetic changes upon transformation are key steps toward developing rational mechanism-based targeted anti-cancer therapies.The aim of my project will be to further investigate the role of epigenetics in regard to EWS-FLI1 by identifying and characterizing CSC and exploring how epigenetic alterations lead to their emergence and direct their tumor initiating and metastasis promoting properties.1- Determination and analysis of ESFT cells signature epigenetic profile.First, I will describe the epigenetic profile of spherogenic and adherent ESFT cells. I will address the epigenetic markers changes between the more tumorigenic sphere-forming cells and the adherent cells by focusing on histone methylation and acetylation.2- Determination of chromatin modification in CD133+ versus CD133- cells.Secondly, I will determine chromatin modifications in CD133+ versus CD133- cells. These cells will be isolated from fresh human tumor samples or from ESFT propagated in immunocompromised mice. I will also assess the influence of human versus murine microenvironment on CD133+ epigenetic markers.3- Assessment of epigenetic changes that underlie cell permissiveness for EWS-FLI1 expression and function.Finally, as EZH2 has been shown to facilitate EWS-FLI1 expression in fibroblasts, I will perform RNA-seq gene expression comparison between cells transduced with EZH2 and their control counterparts. I will then perform ChIP-seq on both sets of fibroblasts to identify EZH2-induced chromatin mark changes and correlate them with gene expression data. Selected genes could be tested for responsibility in blocking or enhancing permissiveness for EWS-FLI1 expression.The major contribution of this work will be to assess epigenetic differences between fresh primary tumor initiating and non-tumorigenic bulk tumor cells in ESFT. Such a study has never been done in part because of the paucity of primary tumor samples and in part because of the challenge of nano-ChIP-seq technology. My host lab provides me with the possibility to overcome both obstacles as it possesses and continues to obtain primary ESFT samples and has established nano-ChIP-seq technology. In addition, the project will assess the effect of in vitro culture and mouse propagation on CSC and non-CSC ESFT populations, which is a central issue toward understanding how well cultured tumor cells and tumor cells grown in mice represent the corresponding fresh primary cells. Finally, the project will define the epigenetic events that convert a non-permissive to a permissive cellular environment for EWS-FLI-1 expression and function, which will provide important and long sought insight into the pathogenesis of ESFT.

98	Professor Richard Shaw	University of Liverpool	None	2018-01-01	2023-06-30	SAVER - Sodium Valproate for Epigenetic Reprogramming in the Management of High Risk Oral Epithelial Dysplasia	Proof of Concept:A recent large epidemiological study showed that long-term use of the antiepileptic agent sodium valproate (SV) reduces the incidence of head and neck cancer in high-risk patients. SV is known to inhibit histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity which may explain the putative chemopreventative effect. HDAC inhibitors are licenced for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and importantly another epigenetic modulator azacytidine is used to prevent malignant transformation of high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. Animal models also support a role for HDACi in cancer prevention activity. Finally epigenetic changes have a proven central role in oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) and its progression to carcinoma. Hypothesis: SV will reduce the rate of malignant transformation in patients with high risk OED through epigenetic modifications.Aims:1) To establish clinical activity of SV as chemopreventive therapy in high-risk OED.2) To explore the hypothesis that SV reduces progression through epigenetic reprogramming.3) To investigate the feasibility and acceptability of a phase III randomised controlled trial of SV chemoprevention. Design:Randomised (2 SV: 1 Placebo) double-blind placebo controlled phase II clinical trial.Population:Patients with OED at high risk of progression to carcinoma (malignant transformation) who have a standard of care therapeutic plan for either close surveillance or surgical resection (patients on either pathway may be recruited).Interventions:Treatment arm: Sodium Valproate 1000mg/dayControl arm: PlaceboOutcomes & Assessments:1) Clinical histological and molecular activity measured using a previously established surrogate composite endpoint which combines changes in:a. Clinical appearance (dimension)b. Histological grade of dysplasiac. Allelic imbalance (3p14 9p21 17p13)This primary endpoint is measured before and after a 4-month of SV or placebo treatment.2) Mechanistic endpoints will explore the hypothesised epigenetic mechanism of action: histone acetylation in circulating white cells and corresponding tissue specific changes in pre- and post- treatment biopsies of the oral lesions. Additionally expression of gene targets in a tissue- & disease-specific panel will be assessed by mRNA transcriptional profiling (Nanostring). DNA promoter methylation most strongly linked with OED malignant progression (P16 DCC EDNRB) will also be studied while downstream effects on proliferation apoptosis and senescence will be assessed by IHC. 3) Feasibility: rates of recruitment screening:randomisation drop-out completion of treatment toxicity. An embedded qualitative study with a purposively selected sample of patients including topic-guided face-to-face semi-structured interviews will focus on patients’ accounts. Sample Size and Analysis:Randomised phase II design based on exact binomial probabilities allowing for unequal allocation ratios: 110 patients randomised 2:1 SV: Placebo assuming 10% dropout.The primary endpoint is response rate using a composite end-point (clinical/pathology/molecular). Analyses shall be carried out assuming a binary response rate with further ordinal modelling carried out should the data allow. Feasibility shall be assessed based on the ability of the study to meet recruitment targets.Economic benefit: reduction in malignant transformation of OED will outweigh the modest costs of SV.

Indeed progress in understanding tumorigenesis mechanisms has proved its therapeutics potential, yet most of them remained elusive or unknown. The research plan presented here is in line with this ongoing effort, proposing to explore promising new mechanisms in tumorigenesis using cutting edge technologies. Cancer cells are characterized by the presence of genetic and epigenetic alterations that lead to loss of cell identity, uncontrolled cell proliferation, cell invasion and metastasis. However, upstream events that drive the appearance and selection of these alterations remain poorly understood. Past two decades has revealed the key function of epigenetics mechanisms in maintaining cell identity and genome stability whereas their corruption is a hallmark of tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Epigenetic information relies on a combination of DNA modifications, nucleosomes positioning and modification, and many proteins that define, maintain and functionally translate this information. Therefore to maintain cell identity, faithfully duplication and transmission of epigenetic information to daughter cells is as important as duplication and transmission of the genetic information. However, little is known about how the epigenetic information is propagated during the cell cycle and recent findings raise the question of its potential implication in tumorigenesis. In S phase, the progression of DNA replication forks provokes a genome-wide disruption of the epigenetic information. This proposal aims to reveal how cells restore epigenetic information after DNA replication and to explore the interplay between these mechanisms and tumorigenesis. To this end, I will combine Nascent Chromatin Capture (NCC), a technology for purification of newly synthetized chromatin that I have developed, with mass spectrometry, high-throughput microscopy and screening technologies in normal and cancer cells. Newly identified players that are subjected to deregulation in cancer will be next characterized in order to understand their role in cancer development and their therapeutic potential.

First, we have worked for the past 15 years on understanding the biological functions of non-coding RNAs and the mechanisms by which these RNAs act. Most recently, we have worked extensively on a small RNA based innate immune system, the piRNA pathway, and its role in protecting germline integrity in animals. Secondly, we attempt to tackle critical problems in cancer biology, with a major focus on breast and pancreatic cancer. We use mouse models, human tissues, and innovative approaches to understand aspects of disease ranging from the genetics of early, non-invasive cancers to critical pathways driving metastasis. We also work to understand the roles of long non-coding RNAs in normal development and how their functions might be disrupted in cancer. Building from our observations that small RNAs direct DNA methylation during germ cell development in animals, we have developed a broader interest in epigenetic regulation, both in normal cell and in cancer. Finally, have a long history of technological innovation, having developed approaches such as short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) and exome capture.

These ongoing efforts have led to numerous insights. In particular, even tumours of similar histological origin and classification harbour variable numbers and types of mutational signatures, revealing an unanticipated level of genetic heterogeneity. This has fundamentally altered cancer therapeutic strategies, patient diagnosis and prognosis, and clinical trial design. However, a widely-assumed, yet to date not experimentally well-tested, hypothesis is that human cancer genome sequences must in part be shaped by the starting tissue's regulatory architectures, including open chromatin, transcriptional regulator binding, replication timing, and polymerase binding. There is correlative evidence at the megabase scale that certain epigenetic features may influence the mutagenic landscape of cancer. This award will fund a series of large-scale experiments to map at high resolution the starting landscape and eventual cancer genomes from a representative somatic tissue in a model organism.We expect this set of experiments will provide insight into the regulatory features that help direct the pathways and functional consequences of genome evolution during carcinogenesis.

102	Dr Duncan Sproul	University of Edinburgh	None	2016-09-01	2022-08-31	The impact of genetic interactions on DNA methylation in breast cancer	Background:Epigenetic dysfunction is a near universal feature of carcinogenesis. DNA methylation alterations affect key breast cancer genes such as BRCA1 suggesting their importance to carcinogenesis and progression. However, the mechanisms underpinning such alterations in DNA methylation are unknown, so their significance remains unclear.My recent work suggests epigenetic marks are strongly programmed by the underlying DNA sequence. This means that sequence variants are likely to be an important and underexplored influence on breast cancer epigenomes.Aims:This project aims to understand the role of the genome in programming the epigenetic mark DNA methylation in breast cancer through two aims.1. Define the extent to which germ-line and somatic DNA sequence variants modulate local levels of DNA methylation in breast tumours in vivo.2. Understand how the effects of regulatory variants on DNA methylation and gene expression interact and how such variants impact on clinical phenotypes.Methods:I will elucidate the frequency to which germ-line and somatic sequence variants affect DNA methylation in breast cancer through machine-learning analyses of HER2-driven mouse mammary tumours and clinical high-grade luminal breast tumours. The interaction between variant-modulated alterations in DNA methylation and gene expression will be tested using genome editing technologies and the promoter of BRCA1 as a paradigm. The phenotypic impact of BRCA1 regulatory mutations will be assessed through engineering into mice. These synergistic approaches reinforce one another to uncover the global impact of sequence variation on DNA methylation, the mechanistic details underlying these effects and their clinical relevance. How the results of this research will be used:This project uses state-of-the-art computational and laboratory approaches to leverage genetics towards tackling our lack of understanding regarding the impact of DNA sequence variation on epigenetic alterations in cancer. In doing so, it impacts on our understanding of the regulation of a key breast and ovarian cancer risk gene, BRCA1, and provides new approaches to delineate the contribution of regulatory variants to carcinogenesis and progression.

Microsatellite-unstable (MSI+) tumours are commonly found in the colon where they comprise ~15% of all cancers. MSI+ cancers can occur as a result of the familial Lynch syndrome which is caused by germline mutations in components of the mismatch repair pathway such as MSH2 and MLH1. MSI can also arise in sporadic cancers where, in the majority of cases, MLH1 is silenced by promoter methylation. Colorectal tumours arising in Lynch syndrome patients usually develop via the classical adenoma to carcinoma pathway. In contrast, sporadic MSI+ cancers develop from sessile serrated adenomas. This pathway is characterised by the presence of BrafV600E mutations and has a lower frequency of APC mutations than the classical pathway. Sporadic MSI+ cancers with BrafV600E mutations and promoter silencing of MLH1 form a significant subgroup of colorectal cancer with a good prognosis but a differential response to common chemotherapies. A greater understanding of this group of cancers is essential to develop subtype specific or targeted treatments. Germline Mlh1 mouse knockouts with and without Apc mutations have been studied and proved representative of Lynch syndrome but to date, no model of somatic Mlh1 coding mutation combined with BrafV600E mutation exists. In this proposal we aim to generate and characterise such a model using the IMPC Mlh1tm1c strain and compare it with an existing Mlh1 promoter mutation created in our laboratory. We will use these systems to investigate the initiation and progression of sporadic MSI+ tumours. Our long term goal will be to use either or both models to test existing and novel therapies, including immunological and epigenetic based approaches, in this distinct class of colorectal cancer.

The most common leukaemic disruptions of the MLL1 gene are chromosome translocations that fuse the N terminus of MLL1 in frame with over 40 different partner genes creating novel fusion proteins. Recent work has suggested that wild type MLL1 and MLL1 fusion proteins cooperate in leukaemogenesis by together causing aberrant epigenetic profiles at target genes in vivo. Epigenetic changes are often defined as heritable changes in gene expression or chromosome stability that don’t alter the underlying DNA sequence. We are interested in identifying the key molecular events in MLL1 mediated leukaemogenesis in order to fully understand the epigenetic basis for this disease. This major goal has been divided into three key questions: 1) What key downstream gene targets are essential for MLL1 mediated leukaemogenesis?; 2) how do MLL1 and MLL1 fusion proteins control epigenetic gene regulation on a molecular level?; and 3) how are MLL1 and MLL1 fusion proteins recruited to important gene targets in the cell? To answer these questions, we are using xenograft transplant assays to identify Leukaemic Stem Cells (LSCs) in MLL1 patient samples, ChIP-seq to identify and characterise direct gene targets in specific haematopoietic cell populations, small molecular inhibitors and siRNA combined with ChIP and ChIP-seq to determine how MLL1 fusion proteins regulate gene targets in the cell and MLL1 domain analysis coupled with genome wide techniques to determine how MLL1 is recruited to gene targets in the cell. Answering these questions may not only be useful for future therapeutic strategies, but will also inform our basic understanding of epigenetic gene regulation during normal stem and progenitor cell development.

CD161 is expressed on various immune cells, including newly discovered populations such as MAIT cells and innate lymphoid cells. To identify the intratumoural cells contributing to improved prognosis, I will develop a tool for the bioinformatic enumeration of pure cell types from complex populations. As chromatin accessibility and enhancer landscape reflects cell identify better than mRNA levels, differentially accessible loci will be a unique signature for each cell type. Using state-of-the-art technologies, my key goals are to: 1. Generate a comprehensive epigenetic signature matrix encompassing novel immune cell types 2. Use this to deconvolute the epigenome of colorectal carcinoma tumours 3. Directly identify the infiltrating CD161-expressing population correlated with improved survival in colorectal cancer By improving our understanding of how multiple immune populations collectively infiltrate tumours, including novel CD161-expressing cells, this work will enable future cancer immunotherapies to target protective immune subsets. Furthermore, the proposed work will provide a resource that can be easily applied to epigenetic data from other malignancies.	Wellcome Trust	Sir Henry Wellcome Postdoctoral Fellowship	250000.0	GBP
106	Dr Timothy Humphrey	University of Oxford	None	2018-05-08	2021-05-07	Targeting altered histone modifications in breast cancer	Advances in genomic and transcriptomic analysis have significantly improved our understanding of breast cancer biology. However, the impact of the epigenetic landscape in breast cancer development and prognosis is poorly understood. We propose to test whether we can target particular histone modifications that are frequently lost in breast cancer using a synthetic lethality approach. Further, we will test whether we can improve targeting using a combination of novel drugs together with approved DNA–damaging agents. Lastly, we will identify genetic determinants underlying alterations of particular histone marks to facilitate biomarker development. We anticipate that the ability to target such epigenetic alterations will have an important impact on breast cancer treatment and will be of significant clinical interest.

In addition we wish to follow up on our observations on the semaphorins and their receptors through a studentship. Our small pathology laboratory (Project 5) will continue to support tissue analysis for the above projects, and those with our collaborators. The level of funding requested for these studies is equivalent to our current staff support. We are proposing one new area, which brings together the current group’s expertise in breast cancer with Dr Hamilton’s expertise in RNA interference, to investigate siRNA directed epigenetic gene silencing of tumour suppressor genes in breast cancer. For this we are requesting an additional postdoctoral scientist and a technician. After only three years a number of interesting leads have been identified. We have had to make difficult choices and have decided not to pursue our work on transcription factors, but to concentrate on mammary gland biology and breast cancer, where we have more expertise. TSC22 will be followed up in collaboration with Kevin Ryan at the Beatson Institute and Bruce Whitelaw at the Roslin Institute, through alternative sources of funding. Overall there will be 5 projects, including: Project 1: The role of the Reelin pathway in mammary gland development and breast cancer.

109	Dr Natalie Shenker	Imperial College London	Surgery and Cancer	2019-05-01	2023-10-31	Maximising the public health impact of a human milk bank	Human milk is hugely complex, containing thousands of factors that guide development, protect babies from infections, and train their immune system to recognise harms. Breastfeeding also gives major health benefits to mothers, but these are largely unknown and unexplained. Furthermore, human milk banks, which provide screened donated breast milk to sick infants when a mother's milk supply is insufficient, have been restricted in recent decades, meaning donor milk is now rationed to only the most preterm babies. The UK has no dedicated centre of research into human milk, and few centres in the world focus on the maternal health impact of breastfeeding. Having founded the first independent non-profit human milk in the UK 2 years ago, I have laid the groundwork to launch an innovative programme of three research projects, each of which will lay the foundations for a larger body of impactful research and clinical advances. The three projects are summarised: 1: Genetic mutations are known to cause breast cancer (e.g. BRCA1 mutations), but much less is known about the epigenetic risk. Epigenetics describes the modifications to DNA that regulate how much of the DNA is turned into proteins. Epigenetic patterns are tissue-specific, so patterns detected in breast cells are different to other tissues such as blood. Previous research, including our own work, has identified epigenetic patterns of breast cancer risk in the DNA of blood DNA. We have found evidence that different cancer risk factors, such as smoking, alcohol and BMI, influence these patterns. However, it is difficult to extrapolate these findings to breast tissue. Breast milk contains a large number of cells from the lining of the breast ducts that are the same cell type that may develop breast cancer. Many of the molecular changes that cause breast cancer may occur long before the cancer has developed and may be detectable in these cells. First, I will recruit more subjects into our research cohort to reach a minimum of 300 subjects. We will assess known epigenetic markers of risk including aging, smoking, alcohol and BMI. This project will provide evidence of early changes in normal breast cells and provide important biological insights into how these increase risk. Finally, this work will provide the evidence needed to create a large study of milk from 20,000 women to develop new cancer screening tests. 2: The World Health Organisation recommends children are breastfed for at least 2 years, but only tiny amounts of data exists on the composition of human milk beyond 6 months. We will recruit 45 mothers to give samples of milk every 3 months over at least 2 years, and profile each sample for the 1000s of fatty acids to understand how milk composition changes, if at all. This information will guide milk donor recruitment, address the value of breastfeeding beyond 6 months, and inform future studies of targeting donor milk for babies with specific nutritional needs. 3: Babies born just a few weeks prematurely, so-called late preterm babies, have a higher risk of death and ill health than full-term babies. They are often a good weight and mostly do not need help with breathing, but still have subtle problems. One of these problems is a lower chance of establishing breastfeeding. Extremely premature babies who receive only mother's milk or donor milk do better in both the short- and long term compared to those who receive formula. Mothers whose babies receive donor milk see it as a 'bridge' to expressing or breastfeeding. We will recruit 120 babies and mothers born late preterm and randomise them to receive donor milk compared to formula with lactation support to assess whether this helps mothers to establish breastfeeding. The three questions addressed in this Fellowship aim to help improve the UK's breastfeeding rates, which have been among the worst in the world for more than two decades. This Fellowship presents a unique opportunity to drive change.	Medical Research Council	Fellowship	954821.0	GBP

Patients may do well after surgery and initial treatment, but drug resistant and fatal metastases often develop. Improved treatment options are urgently needed. The connecting thread of this project is the identification of epigenetic drivers of breast cell fate, tumor heterogeneity and metastasis. Tumor heterogeneity impinges on prognosis, response to therapy, and metastasis and is one of the most important and clinically relevant areas of cancer research. Tumor heterogeneity results from genetic and epigenetic alterations that enhance the plasticity and fitness of cancer cells in the face of hurdles like the metastatic cascade and anti-cancer therapies. Unfortunately, the driving molecular mechanisms remain unclear, particularly the potential interplay between signalling pathways and epigenetic programs. This interdisciplinary project uses pathophysiologically relevant models and state-of-the-art technologies to identify molecular mechanisms underlying crosstalk between key signalling pathways and epigenetic programs in the normal and neoplastic breast. We hypothesize that interfering with these programs will decrease tumor heterogeneity. We will address the effects of: - SHP2/ERK signalling on the epigenetic programs of tumor-initiating cells (Aim 1) - PI3K pathway hyperactivation on the epigenetic programs underpinning cell plasticity (Aim 2) - Epigenetic regulators on normal mammary cell self-renewal and on metastasis (Aim 3) By investigating the integrated effects of key signalling pathways and epigenetic programs in normal and neoplastic breast, this multipronged project will identify and validate mechanisms of cell plasticity. The derived mechanistic understanding will generate means to interfere with tumor heterogeneity and thus improve the efficacy of anti-cancer therapies and ultimately the clinical outcome for patients with breast cancer.

Unlike CD8+ T cells, recognition of cancer cells by NK cells is independent of neo-antigens and potentiated by defects in antigen presentation, making them attractive as mechanistically distinct targets to CD8+ T cells for cancer immunotherapy. Clinical responses to NK cell-targeted immunotherapies have thus far been modest identifying a need to better understand molecular mechanisms that restrict their function. NK cells exist in a variety of different states, called functional maturation states. These have important implications for their ability to control infections and cancer. We lack an understanding of negative regulators of NK cell functional maturation, though identifying such mechanisms may provide new therapeutic targets for NK cell-based immunotherapies. BACH2 is a transcriptional repressor whose expression is predominantly restricted to lymphocytes. New data indicates that BACH2 is an intrinsic negative regulator of NK cell functional maturation with consequences for homeostasis and anti-tumour immunity. The purpose of this work is to establish the function of BACH2 in NK cells, testing the hypothesis that it is a critical negative regulator of NK cell functional maturation and testing its consequences for homeostasis and immune responses to infection and cancer. Our proposed study is organised into three aims: 1. We will determine how BACH2 affects NK cells function under normal conditions, and during influenza infection, where NK cells can contribute to both clearance and immunopathology. 2. We will examine the effect of BACH2 in restraining NK cell responses to cancer. 3. We will map the genome-wide epigenetic and transcriptional changes that occur with NK cell functional maturation and examine the component of the NK cell functional maturation programme controlled by BACH2.

If not diagnosed early can lead to death. Currently, there are no reliable ways to assess the clinical outcomes or response to treatment. Cancer development shares many similarities with embryo development. A group of genes belonging to the HOX family are major regulators of embryonic development. Our previous work on these genes in mouth cancer have shown changes in its expression due to chemical modification. Additional studies on how these alterations may influence key events in mouth cancer may indicate their potential role for prediction and specific treatment.

Unmasking the interplay between different genomic features is critical for understanding the operating system of life. Specifically, revealing long-range epigenetic regulation may uncover predisposition to cancer. Nevertheless, due to the short read-length of single-cell next-generation sequencing, there is no method today that can integrate multiple genomic observables, on the same genome and at the same time. The missing picture constitutes a major genomic “blind spot”, obscuring epigenetic regulation of gene expression. This project aims to provide a multiplexed view of the genome never before accessible. I will utilize single-molecule physical and chemical mapping of individual chromosomes to discover long-range epigenetic correlations, focusing on markers for predisposition to breast cancer. I will approach multiplexing by applying optical and electrical sensing concepts to detect chemical tags attached to long genomic DNA molecules. Equipped with a toolbox of biochemical DNA labeling reactions, I will develop a unique spectral imager for simultaneous acquisition of high-content genomic information from DNA stretched in nanochannel arrays. DNA tagging will also be used to enhance electrical contrast for nanopore epigenetic sequencing. Finally, by combining electric sensing inside nanochannels I will develop new integrated devices for electro-optical genomic analysis. Together, these developments cover the full range of genomic length scales and resolution. MultiplexGenomics will establish a groundbreaking experimental framework for genetic/epigenetic profiling of native chromosomal DNA. A successful completion of this project will make possible the discovery of novel control networks and hidden long-range regulation, opening new horizons for basic genomic research and personalized medicine.

I recently demonstrated that aberrant DNA methylation of CTCF binding sites perturbs chromosomal topology in IDH-mutant glioma and SDH-deficient gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Loss of CTCF binding at the boundary between two topologically associating domains disrupts their insulation, leading to oncogene activation. This groundbreaking model links metabolic, epigenetic and topological alterations and demonstrates that they can drive oncogenesis. Aberrant DNA methylation is common in many tumors and therefore epigenetic CTCF disruption may play a role in other cancers, but this has not been studied to date. Prompted by my findings, recent advances in genome-wide characterization methods and newly available large-scale data, I now propose to systematically uncover the rules of regulation of DNA methylation at CTCF binding sites, and how its disruption in cancer leads to epigenetic heterogeneity and drives oncogenesis. To achieve that, we will develop new statistical models to systematically uncover the rules of regulation of DNA methylation at CTCF binding sites and its impact on topology (Aim 1); uncover mechanisms of epigenetic topological alterations and their role in cancer (Aim 2); and develop computational tools to study intratumor epigenetic heterogeneity to investigate the interplay between different subclones (Aim 3). Taken together, this research program will facilitate a systematic understanding of epigenetic topological alterations and their role in cancer. These are critical goals for the field in order to understand the events that drive cancer, to discover new biomarkers, dependencies and therapeutic strategies, and to inform epigenetic and other personalized therapies.

The Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC) has reported that patients with T2DM may have up to ten-times greater risk of deathwhen they contract COVID-19. Understanding the immune response is critical to preventing or reducingmortality from COVID-19 and informing therapeutic strategies for this patient population. The overallaim of this proposal is to identify the immune basis for increased disease severity and death fromCOVID-19 in patients with obesity and T2DM.It is now appreciated that obesity is associated with immune dysregulation, which may be the cause ofsome obesity related diseases. For example, Natural killer (NK) cells, so-called due to their naturalcytotoxicity against viruses and tumors, are unable to kill targets efficiently in obese humans and mice.We have recently found similar defects in CD8 T cells in patients with obesity and T2DM. The keyunanswered questions are 1) are these immune defects responsible for the increased severity anddeath from COVID-19 in patients with obesity and T2DM 2) do patents with obesity and T2DM have anunderactive or overactive (damaging cytokine storm) in response to COVID-19? and 3) is metabolicdysregulation at the heart of these defects? It is critical to understand the immune basis for thissusceptibility in order to prevent or reduce mortality from COVID-19 and to inform therapeutic strategiesin this patient populations. Findings from this study may lead to understanding the immune responsein patients with obesity for future novel viral outbreaks.	National Institutes of Health	Research Grant	447500.0	USD

It is therefore important to capitalize on the recent insight that epigenetic mechanisms play a role in the increased risk to depression after childhood trauma. We have evidence for a consistent epigenetic maladaptation to childhood trauma in bipolar disorder and therefore propose to target these epigenetic abnormalities for treatment of depression in patients with high levels of childhood trauma. To this end, we will use an available and safe methyl donor: S-Adenyl-Methionine (SAMe) that influences DNA methylation. We have shown that SAMe changes a prominent DNA methylation mark of childhood trauma in vitro, and previous studies have shown efficacy in depression and cancer treatments. We propose a double blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of SAMe (1200 mg for 12 weeks) for treatment of childhood trauma related depression in bipolar disorder patients (N=100). To enhance the efficacy of the epigenetic manipulation, the trial will be carried out in addition to trauma therapy. The primary outcomes are SAMe efficacy for depression treatment and epigenetic changes. Our proposal is a unique first-in-human study which pioneers epigenetic therapy outside cancer research, and explores an entirely new avenue of therapeutic options.	ZonMw	Applied Research	None	None
