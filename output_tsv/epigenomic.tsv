Identification of clinically relevant drug resistance mechanisms provides the opportunity for rational approaches to overcome drug resistance and identify patients who may benefit from treatment. Loss of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) and aberrant gene silencing due to DNA methylation are clinically relevant mechanisms of drug resistance. Approaches to target or overcome drug resistance and novel epigenetic therapies are now undergoing preclinical and clinical evaluation. Aims 1. Chemical genetic approaches to identify novel agents that target cells that have acquired a drug resistant phenotype . We will further characterise small molecules which target MMR deficient cells or reverse epigenetic silencing. We also propose to identify novel molecules which target structural changes in chromatin. 2. Molecular pharmacodynamics in preclinical and clinical trials of novel therapies. We will develop biomarker assays as biological objectives in early clinical trials of epigenetic therapies and new agents entering preclinical and Phase I study. 3. Epigenomic profiling to identify novel drug resistance mechanisms and prognostic biomarkers, particularly in ovarian and lung cancer. We will examine methylation of candidate loci whose function may predict effects on chemosensitivity. We will use global methylation profiling using microarrays to identify novel genes involved in drug resistance.	Cancer Research UK	Programme Award	None	None

Enhancing NSHD is the core programme of the MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, and combines a research and a resource function. The resource function is to curate, enrich and share the NSHD resource, on which all Unit programmes and research collaborations depend. In the last five years, we have completed the 23rd follow-up, a pioneering clinic data collection, with a high response rate, developed data sharing policies and web-based data sharing tools, raised the international and national profile of the study through the NSHD 65th birthday events, and enhanced NSHD through new biomarker and genetic data. A critical mass of biomedical and social scientists undertakes collaborative projects; since 2007, NSHD data has been shared with 211 scientists from 49 research institutions. The research function is to foster integrative research across the Unit programmes and with external collaborators, and to build capacity in life course epidemiology and ageing research. Ongoing studies include: the lifetime determinants of kidney function, thyroid function, and healthy ageing; the long-term health effects of exposure to air pollution; dietary studies; and genetic studies. Much of this work involves comparative research across cohorts. For example, LHA leads the Healthy Ageing across the Life Course (HALCyon) research programme which brings an interdisciplinary group of researchers to study life course determinants of three aspects of healthy ageing across nine UK cohort studies: physical and cognitive capability, social and psychological wellbeing and underlying biology, including aspects of physiology and genetics. More details can be found on www.halcyon.ac.uk. The two main research themes for NSHD in the next five years are: (1) healthy ageing and the management of health and health care needs as the cohort grows older, and how these are influenced by earlier life experiences; and (2) the biology of ageing, linking epidemiology and mechanistic science in this cohort study. The latter includes planned metabolomic and epigenomic projects, and a new research collaboration on the ageing lung. We also plan to extend HALCyon cross cohort research activities, data harmonisation and data sharing through our role in the new ESRC/MRC Cohort Resource Facility and through international collaborations.

Low levels or accelerated loss of capability or musculoskeletal function pose threats to independence and quality of life, are major causes of frailty, disability and death, and impact greatly on health care spending. The ultimate purpose of this programme is to provide evidence to inform the likely timing, intensity and type of future interventions to promote healthy ageing or delay functional decline. This programme takes a life course approach, investigating biological and social factors from early life that influence later life physical capability and musculoskeletal ageing in population cohorts, in particular in the MRC National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD), a birth cohort study with information on health and life circumstances from 0-65 years. Studies in NSHD and other cohorts have provided evidence that childhood socioeconomic conditions, physical growth and maturation, and motor and cognitive development affect objective measures of midlife capability, such as grip strength, standing balance and chair rise performance, in addition to the cumulative effects of adult health behaviours and socioeconomic conditions. In the next five years, this programme will capture the change in physical capability and progression to disability and frailty during the transition from midlife to old age in NSHD; and will investigate the lifetime factors (from societal to underlying biology) that drive these changes, and their consequences, for everyday life. Of particular interest for improving human health are the factors that promote the maintenance of maximal functioning, or modify the consequences of functional decline for everyday activities and social integration. Using new data recently collected or planned, this programme also aims to understand better how factors across life affect bone, muscle and joints in later life and their clinical correlates, osteoporosis and fracture risk, sarcopenia and osteoarthritis. With specialist collaborators we also aim to elucidate underlying biological mechanisms, capitalising on new genomic, epigenomic and metabolomic data in NSHD. This programme addresses the MRC strategic research priority for 2009-14 to improve the chances of living a long and healthy life by driving forward interdisciplinary research addressing health and wellbeing from childhood to older age.

3	Professor Peter Cook	University of Oxford	None	2010-05-01	2013-04-30	System Biological Determination of the Epigenomic Structure-Function Relation: EpiGenSys	Our genetic information is stored in the base sequence encoded by our DNA, and the DNA molecules that run the length of each human chromosome are arguably the longest and most important biomolecules known. But although we now know their DNA sequences, we still know almost nothing about how that DNA is folded in 3-D space in the nucleus of a living cell. As a result, the relation of the 3-D dynamic architecture with function - the storage and expression of genetic information - remains one of the central unresolved issues of our time. The human genome encodes information in: i) the famous DNA double helix, ii) which winds around a protein complex (the nucleosome), iii) and condenses into a higher- order 'chromatin' fiber, iv) that is folded into loops, v) which aggregate in turn into chromosomal subdomains, vi) that form 'territories', vii) which are arranged in a complex way in the nucleus. Modifications affecting function are found at all these levels. Therefore, we have established an unique consortium of European scientists (EpiGenSys") with the aim of achieving understanding the relation between the DNA sequence, 3-D folding, and the way the system is able to access and read ('transcribe') the information. Using a truly inter-disciplinary approach, we plan to integrate the following set of projects: i) The investigation of the dynamic structure locally at the level of the nucleosome and globally at the level of the fiber. ii) The determination of intra/inter chromosomal interactions and the organization of territories. iii) The analysis of the genetic readouts - the transcriptional states - and their relation to the underlying structure. iv) The simulation (using super-computers) of the structure at the level of nucleosomes, fibers, and whole chromosomes. v) The integration of i) to iv) into a mathematical model of the whole system. PR Cook will be involved in projects ii), iii) and iv)."	Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council	Small Grants	377522.0	GBP

This integrated programme of work will identify novel reprogramming factors whose functions will shed new light on the biology of the reprogramming process and improve the generation of iPS cells. Overall, this project will contribute to our understanding of the healthy ageing process and provide new avenues for regenerative medicine and the pharmaceutical industry.

Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. A proportion of these cancers are caused by human papilloma virus and patients being diagnosed with this subtype have a significantly better outcome. The reasons and underlying mechanisms for this are not fully understood. The aim of this project is to carry out comprehensive methylome and microRNA analysis and validation of HPV-associated HNSCC samples. Furthermore, both HPV infected and non-HPV infected cell lines will be studied to obtain microRNA-mRNA interaction maps. These multidimensional data will be integrated and linked to publicly available gene expression data of HPV positive and HPV negative head and neck cancer to identify pathways dysregulated by HPV infection. Determination of the molecular changes occurring specific to viral infection will significantly increase our understanding of virus-induced tumourigenesis and of head and neck carcinogenesis in particular. This will guide the i dentification of molecular markers for risk prediction and early diagnosis. Moreover, the reversible nature of epigenetic aberrations has led to the emergence of the promising field of epigenetic therapy and our understanding of these changes may lead to the development of novel therapeutic targets for this specific subtype of cancer.

6	Professor Jeremy Day	University of Oxford	None	2013-01-01	2017-12-31	Population structure and pathogenicity of C. neoformans in Vietnam.	Most cryptococcal meningitis occurs in patients with underlying immune deficit. Occasionally, disease occurs in immunocompetent patients. Using AFLP and MLST, we have made the novel finding of a genotype of C. neoformans var. grubii, VNIgamma, that causes 92% of disease in the immunocompetent but only 35% in HIV patients. Genotypes do not segregate by HIV risk group, gender, or temporally, suggesting the novel type has increased pathogenicity. This hypothesis drives the fellowship. Pathogenicity is likely a function of adaptation of this saprophytic organism to the environment. Genomic and epigenomic factors are implicated. I will sample the environment to define the diversity of the Vietnamese C. neoformans population and create a multilayered map in order to determine whether there is spatial clustering, and to identify the niche that VNIgamma occupies. I will use a macrophage model to determine the variability of pathogenicity within and between genotypes. I will use comparativ e genomics and RNAseq to test the validity of previously defined virulence factors and to define novel genetic and transcriptional differences that determine pathogenesis in the rabbit model of meningitis. These findings will be prospectively tested using RT-PCR in cerebrospinal fluid samples from human HIV infected and uninfected patients with cryptococcal meningitis.

Over 1000 associations have recently been identified in over 100 traits and common human diseases using GWAS/EWAS. To further advance this research towards identification of the underlying causal variations for therapeutic targeting, requires follow-up on several levels. In the first instance, the identified associations need to be validated, ideally by an independent method and in additional samples. Secondly, the haplotypes, hepitypes and other genomic intervals in which the associations were found need to be further analysed for functional variations in as many samples as possible. The main objective, therefore, is to establish a centralized high-throughput facility for validation and targeted functional analysis that is directly compatible with next-generation sequencing, the method of choice for downstream processes. We believe that the requested equipment from RainDance Technologies satisfies all the technical requirements for accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. It also curre ntly offers best value with respect to throughput, flexibility and future integration with GCLP settings which is a requirement for clinical and future personalized medicine programmes. Under the guidance of the lead applicant, the experienced UCL Core Facility (UCL Genomics) will operate and maintain the equipment ensuring fair access to the 20 named co-applicants and collaborators and beyond if capacity allows.

We discovered several fundamental features of genes under developmental regulation and established the link between the type of core promoter and its responsiveness to long-range regulation, and developed a number of widely used computational methods and data resources for studying the regulatory content of genomes. Our current aim is to understand the molecular and mechanistic basis for different modes of gene regulation associated with the control of cell cycle, multicellular processes and regulation in terminally differentiated cells. In addition to our models of long-range regulation, the newly available epigenomic data contains crucial information for distinguishing these modes in development, differentiation and disease. Our core research program is to identify the features of genes under different modesand regimes of gene regulation. Different genes have regulatory territories that vastly differ in size, are often nested, and exhibit distinct patterns of epigenetic modifications, or succession of such patterns. By investigating genomic regulatory territories, we want to establish sequence features and epigenomic patterns and sequence features associated with different modes of gene regulation. We want to find out which properties of genes, are responsible for the correct sorting and assignment of inputs in complex, nonlinear gene loci. Among the most exciting hypotheses we are currently investigating are the fundamentally different modes of regulation of genes in dividing vs non-dividing, terminally differentiated cells, and time-sharing of core promoters. We plan to investigate how complex input from the cell environment is interpreted by megabase-sized cis-regulatory arrays of these genes to result in tightly coordinated development of complex multicellular structures. Our primary focus is biological insight. Nonetheless, we develop reusable methods for our analysis, to be shared by the community. This has proven to be a highly productive approach for subsequent analyses. In the forthcoming period our method development will focus on i) Transcription factor binding and transcription factor complexes: We are developing a computational toolbox for the analysis and visualisation of large sets of transcription factor binding sites and other regulatory elements and their integration with other types of genome-wide data; ii) Computational methodology for comparative epigenomics – The next several years will witness the rise of the need to analyse hundreds or thousands of epigenomes simultaneously - across tissues, time courses, epidemiological cohorts or different species. Computational capacity expertise and tools for the analysis of this scale are currently largely unavailable. Building on and inspired by methods for the segmentation of epigenomic regions, we plan to build methods for the characterisation of individual regulatory elements and their ensembles around genes under complex regulation.

This major objective of this proposal is to define the molecular, cellular and physiological mechanisms responsible for the association between variants upstream of KLF14 and type 2 diabetes. Our recent work has demonstrated that KLF14 is a master regulator of expression in adipose tissue, and implicate this KLF14-regulated transcriptional network in the genesis of insulin resistance in remote tissues such as muscle and liver. The research will seek to understand the causes and consequences of altered KLF14 expression using a variety of complementary approaches that include: (a) human genetics: resequencing, fine-mapping and epigenomic analyses; (b) integrative physiology: detailed metabolic analyses and genomic studies and their relationship to genotype; and (c) cellular studies: cellular phenotyping and genomic studies in adipocytes following knockdown and overexpression of KLF14 and selected trans-genes. The work has four main aims: (a) To characterise the molecular, cellular and physiological consequences of altered KLF14 expression; (b) To identify the trans-genes mediating the effect of KLF14 on insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes; (c) To define the cellular and physiological mechanisms whereby altered KLF14 expression in adipose tissue leads to generalised insulin resistance and T2D; (d) To characterise the mechanisms whereby common variants upstream of KLF14 influence KLF14 expression. Our research will, by elucidating the mechanisms linking KLF14 sequence variation to diabetes predisposition, provide valuable, generic, insights into the consequences of adipocyte dysfunction on whole-body physiology. The research can be expected to define novel, causally-validated, targets that are substrates for therapeutic and biomarker development, and the application sets out some of the strategies that we plan to deploy to support those translational goals.

10	Prof. Amos TANAY	WEIZMANN INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE	None	2012-12-01	2017-12-01	Evolutionary mechanisms of epigenomic and chromosomal aberrations in cancer	Our working hypothesis is that tumorigenesis is an evolutionary process that fundamentally couples few major driving events (point mutations, rearrangements) with a complex flux of minor aberrations, many of which are epigenetic. We believe that these minor events are critical factors in the emergence of the cancer phenotype, and that understanding them is essential to the characterization of the disease. In particular, we hypothesize that a quantitative and principled evolutionary model for carcinogenesis is imperative for understanding the heterogeneity within tumor cell populations and predicting the effects of cancer therapies. We will therefore develop an interdisciplinary scheme that combines theoretical models of cancer evolution with in vitro evolutionary experiments and new methods for assaying the population heterogeneity of epigenomic organization. By developing techniques to interrogate DNA methylation and its interaction with other key epigenetic marks at the single-cell level, we will allow quantitative theoretical predictions to be scrutinized and refined. By combining models describing epigenetic aberrations with direct measurements of chromatin organization using Hi-C and 4C-seq, we shall revisit fundamental questions on the causative nature of epigenetic changes during carcinogenesis. Ultimately, we will apply both theoretical and experimental methodologies to assay and characterize the evolutionary histories of tumor cell populations from multiple mouse models and clinical patient samples.

Specifically, we uncovered a narrow window of epigenetic sensitivity in gliomagenesis, during which tumor development is dependent on the role of Ezh2, the main enzyme responsible for H3K27 trimethylation within Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). Following the establishment of bona-fide glioma initiating cells (GICs), we found in fact that the Polycomb axis becomes dispensable for tumor self-renewal, an unexpected result that invites a revision of the current model of Polycomb action in tumorigenesis and affords the opportunity to characterize the establishment and maintenance of cancer stem cell compartments in terms of functionally relevant epigenetic changes. Our objective is thus to dissect the epigenetic basis of glioma recurrence, using the regulatory networks we are uncovering in our epigenetically modulated murine models to interrogate a uniquely rare cohort of human GBM samples, in which we can analyse for the first time in the same patient the progression of epigenetic changes during GBM recurrence. As surgery at GBM relapse is exceedingly rare, this cohort of well-established samples represent a unique opportunity to relate disease progression to epigenetic changes. Setting itself apart from the wealth of largely descriptive studies however, our approach interrogates the transcriptomic and epigenomic deregulation of human glioma recurrence through an innovative combination of experimental and computational approaches that is based on the reverse engineering of gene networks emerging from our functional validation of disease stages upon epigenetic modulation.

The Data Mining and Bioinformatics theme will be responsible for the development of novel tools and strategies to access, integrate, merge, visualise and analyse the multi-dimensional datasets within and across the various studies involved in the Unit Programmes. In particular the application of data mining and machine learning algorithms will allow hypothesis-free approaches to data interrogation (Programme 1), which can be followed by hypothesis testing in the other Programmes. Bioinformatics will also underpin the genetic, epigenetic and omics association studies that will be undertaken in all of the Programmes. Objectives and plans: Integration of diverse data types, including large-scale “omics” datasets: integration of very high-dimensional omics data to facilitate data mining and specific hypothesis-based analyses. Filtering and annotation of omics association results: integration of internally generated data with public data from projects such as ENCODE, the NIH roadmap epigenomics project and others to prioritise and filter results. Developing approaches for combining variables in omics data: collapsing and dimensionality-reduction approaches will be developed and applied to reduce the computational burden of association analysis between high-dimensional omics datasets. Development of methods for hypothesis-free mining of complex data: using allele-score based approaches to de novo identification of potential causal relationships across a wide range of phenotypes/outcomes. Training in bioinformatics and data-mining: specific training will be developed to build in-house skills in bioinformatics and data mining methodology in the context of high-dimensional data. This theme will further develop the existing core expertise in bioinformatics and data mining to enable Unit researchers to work effectively with the data generated by the Unit and collaborators. The new methods developed will be of broad applicability in the field of molecular epidemiology, and the Unit will train a new cadre of researchers with essential skills in medical bioinformatics.

Aim 2: We will develop and make readily accessible the causal analysis methods and tools and apply Mendelian randomization (MR) to epigenetic questions. Aim 3: We will use DNA methylation as an index of past exposures to improve our prediction of disease risk and prognosis. Aim 4: From neurodevelopment to cancer, there are a multitude of settings in which we can apply epigenetic epidemiology to understand disease mechanisms and predict disease. Methods: We will utilize multiple data sources; from in-house studies, via collaborations and consortia, and through publicly accessible repositories. Our primary focus will be on the analysis of DNA methylation, as this continues to be the most readily available source of epigenetic data in population-based studies. However, we will integrate these data with newly generated and publicly available epigenomic and transcriptomic data, tissue-specific data and histone modification data. A wide range of methods will be applied. These include mQTL analysis, functional annotation and machine learning approaches, such as penalized regression, support vector machines, and neural networks. We will test for mediation using MR and apply our prediction methods in disease relevant datasets. Translation: The output arising from this programme will be used to develop biomarkers of disease risk and disease prognosis. It will also shed light on the genetic architecture of DNA methylation and the causal role this molecular phenotype plays in development and disease, which will in turn inform future interventions.

In this way PSCP will establish a leading position in the field of stem cell product development for clinical trials and its potential for industrialisation.

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) where leukemic stem cells (LSC) are frequently initiated by chimeric transcription factors (CTF) such as MLL/HOX fusions, we and others have revealed that master transcriptional regulator, Bmi1, and the canonical Wnt/ß-catenin signalling pathway, which dictate the cellular identity and lineage specificity, play critical roles for development of LSC. Genetic ablation of Bmi1 compromises self-renewal property of LSC induced by Meis1/Hoxa9 and AML1-ETO but not MLL fusion, whereas inactivation of ß-catenin suppresses MLL-LSC. While these studies provide important clues for molecular pathways potentially critical for LSC, it becomes clear that the cellular origin of LSC also plays an equally important role in determining the disease biology. AML stem cells derived from hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) or committed early myeloid progenitors (e.g., CMP, GMP) carrying same initiating events can result in phenotypically identical disease, however, emerging evidence indicate that these origin-specific LSC can exhibit very different biological properties and potential therapeutic responses including the ß-catenin inhibition, revealing a contrasting biological difference of these phenotypically and genetically identical diseases driven by different origin-specific LSC. Thus the proposed program aims to address this issue and dissect the underlying molecular pathways critical for their functions by performing comprehensive molecular and functional analyses on the origin-specific LSC from both the mouse models and their counterparts in the corresponding human diseases. Specifically, we will 1) define and characterize the functions of the major molecular pathways mediated by Bmi1 and ß-catenin in origin-specific LSC derived from mouse models that closely mimic the human diseases; 2) determine the molecular signature and downstream targets and pathways critical for these origin-specific LSC by global epigenomic/transcriptomic analyses followed by RNAi screens; and 3) translate the findings from mouse models into human diseases by characterizing the corresponding origin-specific LSC from human cord blood transformation models and primary MLL patient samples. In addition, we will also explore and establish the potential therapeutic values of targeting origin-specific human LSC with relevant small molecule inhibitors being developed for the clinics. Together, this program not only will provide unique insights and the novel conceptual advance into the biology of LSC, but also can facilitate the development of more effective cancer therapeutics that can be directly translated into patient's benefit.

Somatic cell reprogramming is overcoming this limitation through the derivation of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) that can be differentiated into disease-relevant cell-types. Despite these tantalizing possibilities, there are critical issues to be addressed in order to secure iPSC-modeling as a robust platform for the interrogation of disease aetiology and the development of new therapies. These concern the taming of human genetic variation, the identification of differentiation stages in which to uncover and validate phenotypes, and finally their translational into drug discovery assays. This project confronts these challenges focusing on the paradigmatic case of two rare but uniquely informative disorders caused by symmetric gene dosage imbalances at 7q11.23: Williams Beuren Syndrome and the subset of autism spectrum disorders associated to 7q11.23 microduplication. The hallmark of WBS is a unique behavioral-cognitive profile characterized by hypersociability and intellectual disability in the face of comparatively well-preserved language abilities. Hence, the striking symmetry in genotype and phenotype between WBS and 7dupASD points to the 7q11.23 cluster as a surprisingly small subset of dosage-sensitive genes affecting social behaviour and cognition. We build on a large panel of iPSC lines that we already reprogrammed from a unique cohort of WBS and 7dupASD patients and whose characterization points to specific derangements at the level of transcriptional/epigenetic control, protein synthesis and synaptic dysfunction. Through the integration of transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling with targeted mass spectrometry and gene network prediction we propose an innovative drug discovery pipeline for the identification of new therapeutic leads.

In most cases, associations involve regulatory DNA and the specific modulated gene(s), pathways and mechanism of action remain unresolved, limiting translational utility. The goal of this research is to determine the functional basis for genetic associations with AS to advance understanding of disease pathogenesis and define opportunities for therapeutic intervention. We propose a study design adopting functional immunogenomics approaches and focused on primary cells and tissue samples relevant to disease. We will integrate GWAS for AS with our recent data mapping regulatory variants associated with differential gene expression; generate genome-wide maps of physical interactions between AS GWAS variants and target genes using high throughput chromosome conformation capture; and map the epigenomic landscape of AS in which variants act by DNase I hypersensitivity mapping to resolve regulatory elements, analysis of histone modifications, DNA methylation, short and long non-coding RNAs and epigenetic regulators to interpret disease-associated genetic variants. We will functionally characterise specific disease-associated loci including HLA-B27, CARD9 and a gene desert at chr21q22. We will use this functional epigenomic approach to enable novel drug target identification and opportunities for drug repurposing in AS.

I aim to understand the dynamics and importance of promoter-enhancer looping in the regulation of developmental gene expression. The first goal will be to map distal regulatory elements which physically interact with the promoters of important human neural crest-specific genes using Capture-C. Together with pre-existing epigenomic annotation of neural crest enhancers, this will generate a comprehensive view of putative active enhancer elements for these genes. To dissect their functional importa nce, I propose to genetically ablate identified enhancer loci, initially focusing on four regions identified within the SOX9 gene desert at a locus implicated in human craniofacial malformation. Analysis of promoter-enhancer looping interactions has thus far been limited to fixed material, I therefore aim to monitor the dynamics of these interactions in real-time to understand the importance of looping in transcriptional regulation. I will therefore establish a cell line for live imaging of p romoter-enhancer looping in relation to gene expression at stages of human neural crest development by fluorescently labelling the enhancer, promoter and mRNA of the SOX9 gene. Together this proposal will help elucidate the mechanisms by which distal regulatory elements modulate gene expression, and may shed light on how mutation of enhancer elements contributes to congenital disease.

From our cohort of 3000 genetically undiagnosed MODY patients, we will select the 250 most likely to have a monogenic cause of their disease. To do this we will use a validated probability calculator that assigns a likelihood of a patient having MODY by integrating various clinical criteria and biomarker information. We will ensure that coding mutations in all known monogenic diabetes genes are excluded using a targeted sequencing assay of the exons and minimal promoters of these genes. Whole genome sequencing will be performed on at least 100 of the remaining patients. Initially we will test for previously undetectable mutations at known monogenic diabetes genes, as whole genome sequencing provides the opportunity to identify structural, copy number and deep intronic cryptic splice variants. We will test for cis-regulatory mutations by integrating the whole genome sequencing data with epigenomic annotation from two cell types that are key to diabetes, pancreatic islets and pancreatic progenitor cells. We will test whether unrelated families share novel variants in active regulatory elements. We have successfully validated this approach by identifying mutations in an enhancer 25kb downstream of PTF1A as the commonest cause of isolated pancreas agenesis. Genome-wide analyses will be performed to look for regulatory elements at novel genes, as some genes may only cause MODY-like diabetes if tissue-specific regulatory elements are mutated. To prove causality of any particular variant we will test for co-segregation within families, and we will sequence the putative regulatory element in our remaining MODY cohort and patients from our world-wide network of collaborators. For any variant with convincing genetic evidence, we will perform functional studies in cultured human cells and in vivo using transgenesis in zebrafish.

We are requesting funds to develop our genomic sequencing infrastructure, primarily through the acquisition of a Pacific Biosciences single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing system, making us one of only a handful of institutes in Europe to have such capability. This system will enable us to assay, identify and analyse regions of the genome hidden from current methods for gene discovery, and facilitate research into the functional mechanisms involved in disease. The Pacific Biosciences RS II SMRT Sequencing System provides the highest consensus accuracy and longest read lengths of any sequencing technology; current average read-lengths are >8.5kb (with a maximum of ~50kb). SMRT sequencing will facilitate advances in disease characterisation, stratification and diagnosis via its unique utility for de novo assembly across highly complex regions of the genome, targeted re-sequencing, long-range phasing of genetic variation, and epigenomic analysis via the direct allele-specific detection of modified DNA bases. We will also develop our High-Performance Computing/Informatics Infrastructure to enable the storage, analysis, alignment, and assembly of SMRT sequencing data. This infrastructure investment will enable the world-leading genetic and epigenetic research groups at the University of Exeter Medical School to further develop their innovative program of clinical genomic research in human disease, with a specific focus on diabetes and neurological phenotypes.

The evidence points to variations in maternal diet (and hence a mother’s methyl donor metabolome) as being responsible; when methyl donor supply is poor, resulting in a displacement of the intermediary pathways driving methylation (especially the SAM/SAH ratio), there is a higher frequency of offspring showing loss of imprinting. This project has 3 key aims: Aim 1: Extend our analysis of VTRNA2-1 methylation to include 700+ additional mother/infant pairs to better characterise the periods of critical exposure. This will help to refine our insights into the maternal nutritional exposures responsible for loss of imprinting. We will extend our analysis of the maternal methyl donor metabolome to an additional 350 mothers and an extended panel of nutrients and intermediary markers. We will then work with in silico modellers to establish which are the critical drivers of methylation variation; Aim 2: Examine the implications of imprinting or loss of imprinting at VTRNA2-1 on gene expression and cellular function using a recall-by-epigenotype methodology; Aim 3: To design a nutriceutical intervention to prevent disrupted DNA methylation. This aim will be based on insights gained from Aim 1 and will perform small scale preliminary interventions in small groups of non-pregnant women in preparation for anticipated large scale trials.

The study aim is to reduce the late swallowing side-effects of treatment by de-intensifying post-surgery adjuvant treatment, in a risk-based way. In the phase II study, 218 UK patients will undergo surgery over 3 years. The phase II will roll into a phase III study of ~800 patients powered for survival. Recruitment into Pathos will begin in February 2015. Aims: This sample collection proposal is for 60 months to establish a unique central bio-bank of matched blood samples, fresh (1-5 separate biopsies from the primary tumour and 1-2 from cervical lymph nodes) and paraffin-embedded tumour samples from the 218 patients undergoing surgery in phase II, stored to GCLP standard. Methods: Using RNAseq and ChIP seq analysis and targeted gene sequencing of fresh tumour samples and IHC analysis of FFPE tissue as well as serology and cfDNA analysis of blood, a planned programme of translational research, for which additional funding will be sought, will include the following workstreams 1. An investigation of the tumour/ host immune synapse. 2. An investigation of the prevalence and consequences of viral genome integration and gene expression, in terms of host gene expression and clinicopathological phenotype. 3. The development of tissue based `omics fingerprints of tumour phenotype and risk stratification. 4. The development of clinically relevant blood based biomarkers of treatment response. 5.

Horse chariotry and cavalry also changed warfare and beyond the battlefield new equestrian technologies have stimulated agricultural productivity. However, the 5,500 year long history of horse domestication and management, which transformed the natural evolutionary trajectory of wild horses into the more than 625 domestic breeds living today, is difficult to reconstruct from archaeology, history and modern genetics alone. Yet, with archaeogenetics, one can access the genetic information from past individuals and track in great detail past population trajectories. In this project, I propose to build on the latest advances in the analysis of ancient DNA molecules to gather new genomic, epigenomic and metagenomic information from ancient horses. This will be integrated with archaeozoological, isotopic and historical data to enhance our understanding of the multiple processes underlying the transformation of the animal that perhaps most impacted our history. Starting from the characterization of pre-domestic populations of wild horses, I will evaluate the genomic and dietary impact of early domestication stages and will explore whether horses were independently domesticated in Iberia and the Pontic-Caspian steppe. I will follow how the emergence of chariotry and the development of heavy cavalry impacted the horse’s behavioural, physiological and biological makeup. I will reveal the horse characteristics that were preferred in various historical contexts and will investigate a diversity of management strategies and husbandry conditions to reveal their impact on horses, from classical and late antique periods until the recent creation of modern breeds by means of intensive selective breeding.

In order to ensure the sustainability of this sector it is critical to domesticate and selectively improve the major commercial fish species. To date, the genetic markers used in selective breeding of fish account only for a fraction of the observed phenotypic variation. EPIFISH is a scientifically innovative and timely project that will address fish domestication and selection from a new perspective using a multidisciplinary approach. The rapid pace of substantial phenotypic changes during adaptation to new environmental conditions in fish undergoing domestication raises the original hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms are involved in this process. Thus, the overarching aim of EPIFISH is to ascertain the importance of epigenetics in fish domestication using the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) as model species. Specific objectives are i) to determine how selection affects the miRNA transcriptome and the epigenetic landscape during domestication, ii) to perform a functional characterization of miRNA variants and epigenetic alleles associated with growth, and iii) to validate them as potential epigenetic markers for future selective breeding programmes. The identification of epigenetic markers will be a ground-breaking element of EPIFISH with major impact on aquaculture biotechnology, since they will enable the development and application of epigenomic selection as a new feature in future selective breeding programmes. Moreover, the project outcomes will provide novel mechanistic insights into the role of epigenetics in fish domestication, which will surely open new horizons for future frontier research in epigenetics, namely transgenerational inheritance and nutritional epigenetics.

How these marks alter transcriptional programs and modulate binding patterns of sequence specific transcription factors (TF) remains poorly understood. This currently limits our interpretation of epigenomic maps towards their incorporation into predictive models of gene regulation. ReaDMe has the ambitious goal to systematically define the sensitivity of TFs to local levels of DNA methylation in vivo. We will use a combination of genomics, genome editing and proteomics tools to comprehensively identify transcriptional regulators that respond to DNA methylation. As a first approach, we will interrogate changes in the global TF binding landscape when DNA methylation is ablated from the genome. Using both embryonic stem cells and somatic cells, these experiments are aimed at identifying sites that are occupied by TFs in a DNA methylation dependent manner within different cellular context. Secondly, we will combine parallelized chromosomal insertions with targeted footprinting to determine the link between DNA sequence context, methylation density and TF binding. In a third approach we will define the global chromatin proteome as a function of DNA methylation. Through the use of a novel and orthogonal proteomics assay, we will characterize DNA methylation sensitive changes in the chromatin-bound proteome. Candidate factors predicted from all approaches will be validated and functionally characterized through direct genome-wide mapping as well as loss of function analysis. ERC funding would enable ReaDMe to develop an integrated setup to in vivo identify and characterize where DNA methylation influences the cis-regulatory landscape by modulating binding profiles of trans-acting factors. This goal represents a crucial step towards comprehensive understanding of the genomic readout of DNA methylation and its impact on gene regulation.

Developmental progression is linked to accumulation of epigenetic information mainly in the form of chemical modifications of the chromatin. One of the most striking examples of that is random X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in female mammalian embryos. This process is dependent on coating of one X chromosome by a long non-coding RNA, Xist. This in turn promotes rapid and dramatic remodelling of the chromatin. The functional relevance and exact spatio-temporal dynamics of this process remains elusive. Here I propose to address these questions by using an integrated approach. Firstly I will use an ex vivo embryo culture system to monitor the dynamics of XCI. I will further integrate that information with single cell and population based epigenomic to generate in vivo and in vitro datasets accounting to a roadmap for XCI. I aim at identifying the initial stages of epigenetic programming leading to transcriptional repression as well as genomic loci involved in nucleating these changes. I will finally address the functional relevance of X chromosome epigenetic programming by using gene knockout models and genome-wide single cell transcriptomics approach. Such work will have wide-raging implications beyond the field of XCI and can be extrapolated into other epigenetic regulatory mechanisms.

Chromatin integrates a multitude of signals to control gene expression, only some of which have the propensity to be maintained through replication and cell division. For our understanding of cellular memory and epigenetic inheritance we need to know what features characterize a stable, heritable chromatin state throughout the cell cycle. State-of-the-art methods such as ChIP-Seq provide population-based snapshots of the epigenomic landscape but little information on the stability and relative importance of each studied feature or modification. This project pioneers a rapid, sensitive and selective protein labeling method (termed RAPID) for capturing genome-wide chromatin dynamics resolved over a period of time ranging from minutes to days. RAPID introduces a flexible time dimension in the form of pulse or pulse-chase experiments for studying genome-wide occupancy of a protein of interest by next-gen sequencing. It can also be coupled to other readouts such as mass spectrometry or microscopy. RAPID is uniquely suited for studying cell cycle-linked processes, by defining when and where stable ‘marks’ are set in chromatin. I will employ mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) as a model system for pluripotency and lineage specification. RAPID will define fundamental rules for inheritance of histone and other chromatin-associated proteins and how they are modulated by the fast cell cycle of pluripotent cells. Using RAPID in combination with other state-of-the art genetics and epigenomics, I will collect multi-dimensional descriptions of the dynamic evolution and propagation of functionally relevant chromatin states, such as interstitial heterochromatin and developmentally regulated Polycomb domains.

This is partially due to the, rather surprising, discovery that the vast majority of DNA changes associated with disease are found in ‘non-coding’ regions of the genome, often some distance from the nearest gene. These regions are therefore more likely to regulate gene expression which has been shown to vary across different cell types, stimuli and timepoints. Therefore, the next task to allow full utilisation of GWAS findings, is to determine how these non-coding regions increase the risk of disease. My projects key goals are to link GWAS findings in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to the genes they regulate, the cell types where this regulation takes place and the mechanisms by which different genetic backgrounds increases the risk of disease. I am in a strong position to achieve this, given my skills, background in bioinformatics and the enormous wealth of data now available, both publicly in general cell types, and more specifically in cell types and conditions pertinent to RA, (e.g. patient T cells, fibroblasts, cartilage) which have been generated within the group. I will utilise both public and in-house generated epigenomic data (e.g. Hi-C, ChIP and ATAC-Seq), showing how regulatory regions of DNA are active in different cell types and conditions, link this to DNA interaction data, providing a physical indication of the genes that are regulated, and expression data to score enhancers for every RA region in each cell type. Overlaying our GWAS variants onto this model will provide the next, crucial step in assigning genetic risk of disease to genes, cell type and mechanism.

Two major challenges affect GBM clinical management: its heterogeneity (which treatment will best fit this very patient?) and its resistance to available treatments (will the patient benefit in any way from the chosen therapy?). Here we approach these questions with a personalized entry point. First, we aim to create “humanized” experimental models of GBM accurately reflecting patients at molecular level. These GBM Subtype Avatars models (GSA) will be exploited as “targeted patients” in personalized biology and intervention studies. Since GBM exists as molecular subtypes with similar histopathology but mutually exclusive genetic lesions and molecular features, we will generate GSA by targeting mutations recurrently associated with Proneural, Classical or Mesenchymal GBM subtypes into adult human neural stem cells (NSC). Evidence supports that these cells can give rise to high-grade gliomas when engineered with the appropriate genetic lesions. Next, engineered NSC will be orthotopically implanted into immunocompromised rats and the resulting tumors profiled for gene expression, DNA methylation and copy number aberrations. These profiles will be compared to those generated in patient-derived xenografts and biopsies. Second, to identify drug targets favoring patients’ response to the current standard of care, we will exploit GSA for state-of-art genetic screens in vivo. Specifically, we will seek for synthetic lethal interactions between DNA damaging agents and the GSA transcriptome using an in vivo CRISPRi screening approach. Third, to investigate the molecular basis of GBM heterogeneity in GSA models, we will combine genetic and immunophenotypic tracing with gene expression and epigenomic profiling.

This plasticity plays an important role in cancer progression and tumour heterogeneity. We have made a striking observation that cancer cells of different origin can switch to a common survival state. During this epigenomic reprogramming, cancer cells re-activate genomic enhancers from specific regulatory programs, such as wound repair and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. The goal of my project is to decipher the enhancer logic underlying this canalization effect towards a common survival state. We will then employ this new understanding of enhancer logic to engineer synthetic enhancers that are able to monitor and manipulate cell-state switching in real time. Furthermore, we will use enhancer models to identify cis-regulatory mutations that have an impact on cell-state switching and drug resistance. Such applications are currently hampered because there is a significant gap in our understanding of how enhancers work. To tackle this problem we will use a combination of in vivo massively parallel enhancer-reporter assays, single-cell genomics on microfluidic devices, computational modelling, and synthetic enhancer design. Using these approaches we will pursue the following aims: (1) to identify functional enhancers regulating cell-state switching by performing in vivo genetic screens in mice; (2) to elucidate the dynamic trajectories whereby cells of different cancer types switch to a common survival cell-state, at single-cell resolution; (3) to create synthetic enhancer circuits that specifically kill cancer cells undergoing cell-state switching. Our findings will have an impact on genome research, characterizing how cellular decision making is implemented by the cis-regulatory code; and on cancer research, employing enhancer logic in the context of cancer therapy.

High throughput methods have allowed an “initial glimpse” into pathogenesis and have laid the foundations for a molecular-based taxonomy for personalized therapy. Based on our experience with the molecular characterization of SLE, a recently completed RNA sequencing analysis of 150 patients, and our track- record of “paradigm shift” trials in SLE, we will integrate data from multi-tissue analyses with novel technologies to improve its diagnosis, monitoring and therapy, and ask fundamental pathogenetic questions in systemic autoimmunity. More specifically, we will design gene expression panels and “expression profile”/”clinical trait” correlation matrices for diagnostics, personalized immunotherapy and improved clinical trial design. In a systematic multi-tissue approach, we will examine the role of somatic mutations in enhancing immune hyperactivity and the risk for lymphoma. The staggering (7-9:1) female predominance will be elucidated through elaborate genomic, epigenomic and microbiota analyses of family trios. Finally, we will be pursuing the innovative hypothesis that the fundamental abnormalities of SLE lie within the bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) - from which all cells that participate in the pathogenesis of SLE originate - and establish it as a unifying pathogenetic mechanism. By a combination of novel experimental analyses with single cell genomics, multi–omics, humanized animal models, genome editing and an “organ on-a-chip” device, we will validate HSCs as a therapeutic target. The utility of SLE research extends beyond its boundaries, by providing unique insights as to how the immune system recognizes self-constituents and maintains its homeostasis, and how gender impacts on disease biology.

DNA methylation is a prevalent epigenetic modification in mammals, which is brought about by enzymatic transfer of methyl groups from the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) cofactor by three known DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). The most dramatic epigenomic reprogramming in mammalian development occurs after fertilization, whereby a global loss of DNA methylation is followed by massive reinstatement of new methylation patterns, different for each cell type. Although DNA methylation has been extensively investigated, key mechanistic aspects of these fascinating events remain obscure. The goal of this proposal is to bridge the gap in our understanding of how the genomic methylation patterns are established and how they govern cell plasticity and variability during differentiation and development. These questions could only be answered by precise determination of where and when methylation marks are deposited by the individual DNMTs, and how these methylation marks affect gene expression. To achieve this ambitious goal, we will metabolically engineer mouse cells to permit SAM analog-based chemical pulse-tagging of their methylation sites in vivo. We will then advance profiling of DNA modifications to the single cell level via innovative integration of microdroplet-based barcoding, precise genomic mapping and super-resolution imaging. Using this unique experimental system we will determine, with unprecedented detail and throughput, the dynamics and variability of DNA methylation and gene expression patterns during differentiation of mouse embryonic cells to neural and other lineages. This project will give a comprehensive, time-resolved view of the roles that the DNMTs play in mammalian development, which will open new horizons in epigenomic research and will advance our understanding of human development and disease.

As such, there is an urgent need to develop innovative and effective prevention and treatment strategies. As numerous clinical trials have shown, lifestyle modification is by far the best way to prevent these diseases, with lifestyle being twice as effective as the best drugs, less costly and free from side effects. Yet, human biology is complex, causing some people to respond well and others poorly to the same lifestyle interventions. Thus, a huge, as yet unrealised opportunity exists to optimize the prevention and treatment of cardiometabolic diseases by tailoring lifestyle interventions to the patient’s unique biology. NASCENT is an integrated programme of research through which I will functionally annotate and later translate discoveries of gene-lifestyle interactions made through the interrogation of large epidemiological (N>100,000) datasets at my disposal. The functional annotation of these discoveries will be done using state-of-the-art epigenomic and targeted gene editing tools, whereas the translation of those findings will be achieved using a innovative and powerful clinical trial design that focuses on treatments that are tailored to the participant’s genotype (genotype-based recall). NASCENT capitalizes on a solid foundation of cohorts, methods, and expertise that I have built-up over the past fifteen years, but also exploits state-of-the-art epigenomic and gene-editing technologies that have not previously been used in studies of gene-lifestyle interactions. I expect the integration of these established and new approaches in NASCENT to propel major advances in understanding gene-lifestyle interactions in cardiometabolic disease that help optimise disease prevention.

This disease is characterized by a massive loss of functional cardiomyocytes (CMs) and ultimately leads to heart failure. Despite recent advances in the development of new pharmacological and device-based therapies, mortality from heart failure remains excessively high. While heart transplantation is an option for some patients with very advanced heart failure, the number of patients with advanced heart failure greatly exceeds the number of available donor organs. As such, cardiac regenerative therapies that can restore functional myocytes and native myocardial function in the failing heart have engendered great interest in the last decade. Researchers have made important advances in this field by being able to produce human CMs from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) or from directly reprogramming human fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes (reprogrammed CMs). However, a major roadblock to progress in this field is that the human CMs produced by these technologies are functionally immature, displaying a fetal-like phenotype that does not resemble the physiology of native adult CMs. As we ultimately want to generate mature, adult cardiomyocytes for regenerative and disease-modeling applications, it is essential to find ways to efficiently mature iPS-derived or reprogrammed CMs. To date, progress towards this goal has been very slow, in part, because we currently lack a comprehensive gene regulatory “blueprint” of the normal CM maturation process. Recent advances in molecular and computational biology have shown how the epigenomic control of gene expression plays a key role in dictating cell fate transitions. The goal of this project is to decipher the gene regulatory circuitry of normal CM maturation by leveraging a multidisciplinary approach that will characterize the genome, epigenome and transcriptome during each stage of this developmental process. As there are currently no technologies for efficient maturation of human CMs, we will interrogate of normal postnatal CM maturation in mice, a genetically defined mammalian model system in which key features of postnatal CM maturation are conserved and occur over the course of 8 weeks. Primary CMs will be extracted from heart tissue of mice in a time course of postnatal developmental stages ranging from newborn mice to fully adult mice (8 weeks of age). These CMs will be subject to next-generation DNA and RNA sequencing based assays to dissect the chromatin and transcriptional landscapes underlying cell state transitions during normal CM maturation. This approach will allow us to characterize the gained/lost TF networks and cis-regulatory elements (e.g. enhancers) in each stage of postnatal CM maturation. Implementing newly developed computational approaches, we will utilize these datasets to discover specific cis-regulatory DNA elements and trans-acting factors that can play a crucial role in controlling the different stages of CM maturation. The ultimate goal of this project is to use this information to identify a set of defined factors that can prime or drive the maturation of stem cell derived human CMs. The potential of achieving more complete and efficient maturation of stem cell derived human CMs will be a major advance for the field of cardiovascular regenerative medicine.

In mammals, however, genomes of male germ cells are packaged in a highly condensed configuration. To enable the over 10-fold increase in compaction of the genome in spermatozoa, chromatin undergoes a dramatic remodeling along almost the entire genome at the end of spermatogenesis. Key events in this process are the removal of histones and their replacement first with transition proteins and subsequently with protamines (Govin et al., 2004). Nonetheless, this histone removal is not complete. In humans around 10% of histone proteins are retained on chromatin (Brykczynska et al., 2010; Hammoud et al., 2009), while in mice this number stands at 1%. These later findings raise the important question whether these retained histones would be involved in intergenerational transmission of epigenetic information, thereby contributing to gene regulation in offspring.Unpublished data from my laboratory shows that such retained histones are specifically positioned at regulatory regions of important developmental genes, even more explicitely in mouse than in human spermatozoa (Erkek et al., in preparation; Brykczynska et al., 2010). Furthermore, classes of genes serving distinct functions harbor different sets of post-translationally modified histones associated with either transcriptional activation or repression, in a manner that is predictive for expression states measured in early embryos. Importantly, we find that sequence composition is highly predictive for nucleosome enrichment genome-wide and that nucleosome occupancy inversely correlates with DNA methylation. Results from chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments with histone variant specific antibodies suggest specific functions for the canonical histones H3.1 and H3.2 versus the histone variant H3.3 in chromatin remodeling during spermiogenesis and possibly intergenerational epigenetic inheritance (Erkek et al., in preparation). Further preliminary data indicate the existence of an additional, evolutionary conserved, testis expressed histone H3 variant H3t with putative functions in histone eviction during spermiogenesis. Finally, we have observed, specifically in elongating spermatids, the presence of chromatin-bound histone H3 proteins that are cleaved at their N-termini. We speculate that histone clipping may function in the eviction of these proteins during spermiogenesis. On the basis of these data, we define a comprehensive research program that aims at elucidating the mechanisms underlying histone turnover and retention during spermatogenesis and paternal transmission of histone encoded epigenetic information directing gene expression in the next generation. Hypotheses:1.We hypothesize that nucleosomes containing different members of the histone H3 family are assembled onto and disassembled from chromatin during spermatogenesis by distinct pathways.2.We propose that these variant nucleosomes exhibit different properties on chromatin and are selectively evicted versus retained during spermiogenesis.3.We suggest that variant nucleosomes with specific posttranslational modifications that are retained in sperm play distinct roles in the regulation of gene expression in early embryos.Aims: To test these hypotheses we propose three aims that we will experimentally approach using a combination of biochemical, molecular genetic (transgenic and conditional deficiency mouse models), microscopy, epigenomic (ChIP and RNA sequencing) and bio-computational methods.1.To study the mechanisms underlying histone variant specific nucleosome remodeling during spermatogenesis and retention of H3.3 nucleosomes in spermatozoa. To investigate the role of H3.3 and H3t variants and of canonical H3.1 in spermatogenesis we will generate targeted inducible transgenic mice expressing epitope tagged versions of each of these H3 proteins. We will perform ChIP-Sequencing analyses in purified germ cells to determine the localization of specific H3 variants in the genome during spermatogenesis. We will use these transgenic mice to perform genetic pulse-chase experiments to determine when during spermatogenesis nucleosomes containing H3 variants become incorporated into chromatin. To identify chaperone and chromatin remodeler proteins interacting with the different H3 histones, we will perform immunoprecipitation experiments coupled to protein identification by mass spectrometry (IP/MS) on cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions isolated from germ cells at sequential stages of spermatogenesis. Finally, we will functionally characterize the role of H3 variants in spermatogenesis by generating conditional mutant mice for H3.3 and H3t genes as well as for candidate chromatin assembly factors identified by the IP/MS experiments. 2.To determine the mechanism and function of histone clipping in nucleosomal eviction during spermiogenesis. Unpublished data indicate the existence of chromatin-bound H3 proteins cleaved around residue Glycine 33 in purified elongating spermatids. In vitro assays indicate that the proteolytic activity may reside in a serine or threonine protease. To investigate the function of histone cleavage in nucleosome eviction, we will first identify the precise cleavage site using Edman degradation and sophisticated MS approaches. We will subsequently generate antibodies recognizing cleaved histones. We will then perform biochemical fractionation studies combined with IP/MS detection methods to identify the protease involved. To elucidate the function of the protease in histone eviction, we will generate conditionally deficient mice and study histone cleavage in relation to turnover during spermatogenesis. Likewise, we will generate transgenic mice expressing uncleavable point mutants of H3 proteins in an inducible manner. 3.To elucidate the role of paternally inherited histone proteins in the regulation of early embryonic gene expression. We will use sperm from transgenic males heterozygous for the epitope tagged H3 transgenes (described in Aim 1) to produce pre-implantation embryos. Using microscopy approaches we will then track the presence of tagged H3 in genetically wild-type versus transgenic early embryos to determine whether and how long paternally inherited histones are retained on DNA during early embryogenesis. In addition, we will generate mice expressing H3 variants lacking crucial modified residues to examine the role of residue specific histone modifications in paternal chromatin inheritance. We will examine expression of genes associated with modified histones in sperm in two-cell stage embryos sired by these mice to determine if embryonic gene expression is affected. Expected value: The proposed study comprises a systematic genetic and biochemical analysis of nucleosome remodeling and turnover processes occurring during spermatogenesis. We expect to answer the highly relevant and open question whether nucleosomes in mouse spermatozoa mediate transmission of epigenetic information between generations. We further anticipate to obtain detailed insights into the molecular mechanism underlying nucleosome eviction during spermatid differentiation, leading to the production of functional spermatozoa.

41	Antoine Hendrik Felix Marie Peters	Institute Friedrich Miescher	Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research	2017-04-01	2021-03-31	Understanding molecular mechanisms underlying chromatin reprogramming during male germ cell development	In the life cycle of mammalian organisms, fertilization represents the moment at which genetic information of two individuals is united to give rise to a new individual. A major question in biology is whether and/or to what extent mature gametes carry information beyond the DNA sequence that is important for the development of offspring. Over recent years, numerous studies involving mammalian systems provided some evidence for inter- and/or transgenerational inheritance of phenotypic traits in response to external environmental cues, such as altered nutrition, chemical pollutants, and endocrine disruptors. Alterations in DNA methylation, composition of small RNAs and/or chromatin states have been implicated in the inheritance of such traits, yet, clear mechanistic insights are rather limiting. To elucidate molecular mechanisms involved in such acquired forms of epigenetic inheritance, we aim to dissect (a) the fundamental mechanisms involved in defining chromatin states in mature gametes in unchallenged conditions, and (b) whether such states are instructive in specifying embryonic development. In this proposal, we focus on the development of male germ cells. Following an almost eight week lasting developmental process millions of highly differentiated haploid spermatozoa are day-to-day generated from, originally, a few spermatogonial stem cells. Upon leaving the spermatogonial stem cell pool, differentiating spermatogonia undergo first multiple rounds of replication and thenceforth enter into meiosis to undergo meiotic recombination and haploidisation. During the following spermiogenesis phase, haploid spermatids dramatically remodel their chromatin structure and undertake a major cellular morphogenesis process resulting in the generation of highly compacted and motile sperm.We and others have previously shown that nucleosomes, the basic building units of chromatin, remain present at specific sequences in mature sperm of mouse and men. Ongoing experiments indicate that H3 proteins in nucleosomes “change their identity” by the exchange of canonical replication dependent H3.1 and H3.2 proteins by a testis specific isoform called H3t as well as by the H3.3 variant histone. H3t is conserved among mammals and harbors a few amino acid substitutions relative to H3.1. H3t deficient animals display major defects in the proliferative differentiating spermatogoia and reduced H3.3 levels cause spermatogenic arrest at different stages, pending on residual levels. In this proposal, we combine mouse transgenesis, molecular genetic, epigenomic, and biochemical approaches to understand the function of the H3t and H3.3 histone variants, and to test the role of specific amino acid residues and their post-translational modifications in male germ cell development. We further focus on the mechanisms underlying global transcriptional silencing occurring at the end of spermatogenesis. We propose to perform proteomic analyses of chromatin isolated from developing spermatids to identify novel factors involved in nuclear condensation and nucleosome eviction versus retention. Finally, we aim to determine the localization of nucleosomes in individual spermatozoa and assess their relevance for intergenerational transmission of epigenetic information.We believe that this research will enhance our understanding of the regulatory role of chromatin in male gamete generation and transmission of epigenetic information to the next generation.

However, more than 80% of the genome is developmentally transcribed into non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Formerly described as “junk”, ncRNAs have been recently assigned important roles in many developmental and oncogenic processes. Mechanistically, ncRNAs bind directly to DNA, or form complexes with other RNAs or proteins to regulate expression of genes. One of the best-characterized ncRNA-interacting proteins is the histone-methyltransferase EZH2, the catalytic subunit of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). RIP-seq analysis demonstrated that this epigenetic regulator binds more than 9000 RNAs. Interestingly, about 20% of the EZH2-interacting transcripts derive from repetitive genomic loci including Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements (SINEs). This interaction was initially neglected due to repetitive origin of the SINE transcripts. However, the latest study performed in the Lee Lab re-evaluated this binding and proposed a novel role for EZH2 and SINE-derived B2 RNA in shaping cellular adaptation to heat-shock. Prior to stress, B2 transcripts bind multiple heat-shock responsive genes and serve as speed bumps for RNA Polymerase II (POL-II). Upon heat-shock, however, EZH2 is recruited to the B2 RNA binding sites and destabilizes the RNA, thereby activating high-level expression of the heat-responsive genes to induce the adaptation programs. Unexpectedly, as a mechanism responsible for B2 RNA-destabilization, the study proposes a novel endonucleolytic activity for the histone-methyltransferase EZH2. These findings are very unexpected in two ways. First, they demonstrate an in vivo function for the repetitive RNA, B2, and show that B2 binds to chromatin and influences transcription. Second, they suggest that EZH2 - previously known only as a histone methyltransferase - may have RNAse activity. Thus, this study opens several important questions and these questions will be the focal point of my postdoctoral work. First, I would like to understand the mechanism of EZH2-mediated processing of B2 RNA. Second, I will study whether the EZH2-B2 mechanism is engaged to regulate responses to other stress-stimuli, including hypoxia and ER stress, and in mouse models of cancer. Lastly, given that EZH2 is mutated in multiple human malignancies I will address whether some mutations arise as a mechanism by which malignant cells can evade the stresses occurring in tumors. These aims will add to my scientific skill set by providing training in RNA-protein biochemistry and RNA-based epigenomic analysis, at the same time that they will utilize my PhD training in the organismal response to cancer stress.

It causes half a million deaths yearly and the general 5-years survival rate is around 60%. CRC is primarily managed by surgery (1). Discovery of novel chemotherapeutics agents and accurate biomarkers to identify CRC patients at high risk for recurrence are clinically relevant.The cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2W1, an extrahepatic CYP, was first cloned and characterized in our laboratory (2). It is tumor-specific and about 36% of human CRC specimens highly express CYP2W1, an expression that is associated with worst survival outcome in colorectal cancer stage III in two independent studies (3, 4). Recent studies showed that CYP2W1 metabolizes some xenobiotics, e.g. aflatoxin B1, AQ4N (2, 5). Our collaborators in Bradford University (UK) designed and optimized cytotoxic prodrugs (indoline derivatives) specifically activated by CYP1A1 and, together, we have identified similar agents active on CYP2W1. A couple of these agents are very effective in killing colon tumors in cultures (IC50 500 nM) and in xenograft models containing CYP2W1, but ineffective in tumors without CYP2W1 (6). Nothing is known about the endogenous function or physiological regulation of CYP2W1. The project aims to determine the function and modes of regulation of the gene expression to ultimately increase the amount of drug target in the tumors. The specific aims are (i) to elucidate the mechanism of CYP2W1 expression regulation, (ii) to identify the endogenous function of CYP2W1, (iii) to characterize the expression and activity of CYP2W1 in primary tumors and metastases and its potential role in carcinogenesis and novel type of chemotherapy.Postdoctoral project investigations:Regulation We showed that CYP2W1 expression is regulated in part by DNA methylation status with hypomethylation resulting in increased protein expression (7). Interestingly, CYP2W1 might be induced by 5F-203, GW-610 and imatinib in different cancer cell lines (Geo dataset: GDS3044) (8). Screening of CRC CYP2W1 inducers and inhibitors are currently ongoing. The transcriptome and epigenome changes from tumor tissues and cancer cell lines with or without CYP2W1 expression and with CYP2W1 induction will be analyzed by pyrosequencing and microarray, respectively, with extensive research of tissue specific transcription factors. Enriched biological pathway (i.e. KEGG, DAVID) and molecular interaction and relation networks will be studied.Function CYP2W1 is expressed in rat fetal stages but not in any adult rat tissue. The gene might have an important role in fetal colon, silenced at birth but then reactivated in colon tumors. A developmental curve of Cyp2w1 expression in mice colon from different fetal to adult ages is ongoing to determine the transcriptome, epigenome and protein expression changes of CYP2W1 and its potentiate transcription factors. A screening of the endogenous substrate is ongoing in different tumor cell lines expressing or not CYP2W1. We have just received Cyp2w1 -/- mice and the phenotype and function of Cyp2w1 will be here evaluated through a PhD study co-supervision.Characterization of CYP2W1 expression in human tumorsFresh colon tumors with their corresponding normal tissue and liver metastases have been collected by our collaborators in Karolinska University Hospital. The transcriptome and epigenome will be used (i) to elucidate the role of epigenomic modifications (ii) the role of some gene polymorphisms and (iii) for the identification of possible biomarkers for malignant colon cancer. An overview of CYP2W1 expression status in tumors is also ongoing.References 1.L. Spelt et al. (2012). PMID: 22079259.2.M. Karlgren et al. (2006). PMID: 16426568.3.D. Edler et al. (2009).

MFS is characterized by increased metastasis after numerous local recurrences. Cytogenetic karyotype data suggest that genomic complexity increases with disease progression leading to metastasis. Limited therapeutic options for high-grade MFS and consequent dismal outcome stem from our incomplete understanding of the molecular events underlying its pathogenesis and progression. Additionally, the study of MFS has been limited by the lack of adequate samples and tumor cell lines.Aim: We aim to unravel the molecular alterations of MFS, a model of understudied and poorly understood high grade sarcomas with a complex karyotype, in order to nominate key genetic and epigenomic events in tumor progression and possible drug targets.Methods: Using next generation sequencing techniques, we will interrogate freshly frozen and paraffin fixed MFS human tumor samples and corresponding cell lines. We will use an established computational integrative analysis pipeline to investigate the array of transcriptomic, genomic and epigenomic alterations with the goal of identifying key drivers focusing on drug targetable events.Summary: The molecular determinants of aggressiveness of MFS and therapeutic targets remain elusive. We will take a significant step in characterizing the molecular landscape of this complex karyotype sarcoma with the goal of understanding the drivers of progression and nominating potential therapeutic targets.

Long-term survival can currently be achieved in only ~60% of patients despite of intense multimodal treatment protocols; a disappointing figure stagnating since more than three decades. A partial explanation for treatment failure might lie in the number and kind of mutations in osteosarcoma genomes that vary significantly between individual tumours and of which only few are targetable. Despite the genetic complexity, we have recently shown that >90% of osteosarcomas display mutation patterns similar to those seen in BRCA deficient breast and ovarian cancers (so-called BRCAness) rendering them likely susceptible to PARP inhibitor treatment.Since our findings captured BRCAness only in pre-therapeutic biopsies so far, the proposed project aims to follow its evolution over time using sequentially obtained material from 16 patients, including samples from the initial biopsy, the resection specimen as well as from recurrent disease. We shall integrate exome, genome and RNA sequencing supplemented by copy number and methylation analyses to explore the clonal diversity and hierarchy, thus building an evolutionary history of each tumour. Additionally, we shall assess the degree of BRCAness and therefore the likelihood of specific tumour cell populations to respond to PARP inhibition at different stages of the disease. An additional cohort of >220 osteosarcoma samples, all derived from an international osteosarcoma treatment trial (EURAMOS1), and with complete clinico-pathological data, is available for validation of the main findings from cohort 1 and further (epi-)genetic studies. Together with collaborators from other countries that have also collected samples of EURAMOS1 patients, we aim to assemble the yet largest series of osteosarcomas and attempt to correlate (epi-)genetic findings with clinico-pathological data. Specifically, we shall validate the prevalence of BRCAness and search for complementary / alternative vulnerabilites.We believe that only the complete integration of genomic and epigenomic data may identify subtle functional signatures of mutational processes with prognostic or even therapeutic impact. Hence the proposed project will provide a deeper understanding of osteosarcoma evolution in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, we will determine whether a BRCA-like phenotype is required for recurrence and/or metastatic progression and whether new signatures can be identified by integrating epigenetic data in a large cohort of clinically well characterized osteosarcomas.

Preliminary data show that 25-Hydroxycholesterin (Ch25h) reciprocally impacts the TLR-induced inflammatory response while suppressing expression of interferon-stimulated genes. Therefore, Ch25h appears to be an immune modulator situated at the intersection between innate and adaptive immunity. To further elucidate the mechanisms behind this observation, we will apply a Systems Biology approach using high-throughput methods to uncover the underlying mechanisms. Specifically, we will conduct a pilot study to determine the effectiveness of an analysis strategy combining ATAC-seq, a novel epigenomic analysis technique, and RNA-seq to uncover regulatory networks in vivo by applying it to M. tb.-infection of mice deficient in Ch25h. Elucidating the role of Ch25h in chronic MTB infection and its influence on the innate and adaptive immune system may substantially advance our understanding of the host-pathogen interaction.

The majority of our current knowledge comes from correlation studies comparing transcriptional activity with the distribution of the epigenetic modification and the transcriptional consequence of the loss of a specific modification. While these results are essential to understand the potential function of each epigenetic modification, they are not sufficient to conclude their role in the orchestration of transcriptional changes. More recent studies tried to answer this question by comparing transcription and epigenetic modifications in undifferentiated and differentiated cells. While these experiments clearly identified changes in the epigenetic landscape, this approach does not answer if they are guiding transcriptional changes during differentiation or securing the resulting new stage. To gain a global understanding of the order of events, we aim to identifying changes in gene expression and main transcriptional repressive and promoting histone modifications in cells undergoing differentiation.First, we will develop a novel approach to examine the distribution of histone modifications on a single cell level. For this we will adapt a method based on antibody targeted micrococcal nuclease (ChIC-seq (Schmid et al. 2004)), which will lead to a modification dependent enzymatic digestion of the DNA. In comparison with existing single cell ChIP approaches this method lacks a precipitation step, leading to minimal material loss per cell. At the same time, this approach enables us to use a variety of histone mark specific monoclonal antibodies that already exist. To study the endogenously changes in the order of events during transcriptional programs, we will look specifically at cells undergoing differentiation. Previous work in the Oudenaarden lab (Grun et al. 2016) lead to the development of the pipeline (RaceID + StemID) that allows to infer differentiation stages from single cell RNA seq experiments. One intriguing result from this work was the identification of cells in the process of differentiation, showing a transcription profile in between known cell types. The second aim of this proposal will use an existing stemID data set in the lab to identify suitable surface markers based on their expression that will allow the enrichment of a specific differentiating cell population in a FACS experiment. Indexed sorting will verify the success of this approach. As a continuously differentiating and proliferating tissue, the mouse hematopoietic system provides a large starting population with well-characterized surface markers usable for FACS. Third, we will adopt the previously described method for co-acquisition of transcriptomic and epigenomic information, based on a protocol for co-extraction of RNA and DNA from a single cell existing in the lab (Dey et al. 2015). Identifying the order of transcriptional changes occurring during differentiation will already allow us to identify the first changes that start the differentiation process, providing an unbiased approach for the identification of key differentiation drivers. Comparing the gene specific changes in transcription and epigenetic state will further enable us to clarify if epigenetic changes predict transcriptional changes or the other way around.

The epigenetic “instruction manual” is indeed complex, but a deeper understanding of mechanisms may have far-reaching implications for the early identification and treatment of disease, such as cancer. Advances in technology, and in particular low-cost high throughput DNA sequencing (HTS), have driven an explosion of nucleic-acid-based epigenetics research. Unraveling genetic and epigenetic mechanisms as they relate to development and disease will require a generation of research and a large amount of new data. As computational scientists, we will address the needs of the genome biology community, specifically targeted at quantitative HTS data (e.g. expression or enrichment levels), with a dual-pronged attack: i) we will improve existing “low-level” data analysis methods, to model and adjust for the many biases that affect these datasets; ii) we will create new, innovative “high-level” methods and software tools to assemble and interpret the multifaceted datasets, in close collaboration with researchers that collect the data and who have intimate knowledge of the biology. Specifically, we will use our expert knowledge in the analysis of count data and apply new and improved approaches to interpreting epigenomic data. Existing approaches do not account for all of the artifacts and features of real data (e.g. GC content, copy number), so there multiple situations where we can bring computational skills and experience to bear and create lasting analysis solutions.Our team of computational scientists is fully immersed in and motivated by biological investigations. The data for our proposed methodology development is being generated within the scope of existing projects and importantly, we are involved in the experimental design at an early stage. We will supplement these data with focused benchmarking exercises, to facilitate a better understanding of the data and to validate and compare new computational methods. Our proposal is methodology development, but a large amount of our research time is ultimately spent with our collaborators answering questions in a specific dataset. We do not necessarily drive those questions, but our expertise drives the method development that is fundamental to answering them.An attractive aspect of our research is that our methodological developments spread across multiple data types and biological domains. For example, statistical analyses of count data apply similarly to gene expression data (e.g. RNA sequencing), DNA methylation (e.g. affinity capture sequencing), protein-DNA interaction data (e.g. chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing), and so on, with a small amount of domain-specific tuning. Additionally, our group creates user-friendly software based on the widely-used Bioconductor project and our project will train 2 PhD students in the high-demand field of statistical bioinformatics, in a multidisciplinary data-centric setting.

There is accumulating evidence that genomic non-coding, distant-acting regulatory modules contribute significantly to human disease. However, links to mechanistic processes are very difficult to establish, since a significant proportion of the gene regulatory sequences located in the 98% non-coding portion of the human genome remains unannotated. Enhancers are the major cis-regulatory modules directing tissue- and cell type-specific gene expression and therefore essential for organ formation and morphogenesis. Although next-generation sequencing approaches have uncovered genome-wide enhancer signatures in human and mouse developing hearts, the enhancer and transcript profiles underlying distinct cardiac cell types have remained elusive. Therefore, I am harnessing a new method termed INTACT in combination with next-generation sequencing based technologies to identify the genome-wide epigenomic and transcriptome signatures present in cardiac cell types and subregional cell populations. Correlation of these profiles will allow the discovery of shared and unique regulatory programs and has the potential to identify novel cardiac subtypes. I will use large-scale transgenesis as a gold-standard method to expand the catalogue of subregional heart enhancers and leverage a high-throughput CRISPR/Cas9 injection pipeline to study the function of cell type-specific cardiac enhancers in vivo. The proposed research will reveal the regulatory landscapes of developmental cardiac cell types and dissect the functional properties of heart enhancers to advance the understanding of the molecular etiology of cardiac pathologies.

Therefore the study of disease-relevant tissues is a fundamental requisite to interpret these associations, but has so far been hampered by the lack of appropriate human cellular models. The technology of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which can be differentiated into a variety of cell types, offers a powerful, yet unexplored tool to functionally characterize human regulatory variants. My goal is to demonstrate the utility of using human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) to understand how DNA variants influence cardiomyocyte molecular phenotypes. In the first part of my postdoc in the Frazer laboratory at UCSD, I have generated iPSC-CMs from seven members of an extended family and profiled them using multiple functional epigenomic assays including RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq of two transcription factors (NKX2-5 and SRF) and one histone modification (H3K27ac), and ATAC-Seq to identify regions of open chromatin. We have also generated whole genome sequences from germline DNA of the seven family members. I am currently analyzing these datasets to assess the consistency of the iPSC-CMs in expressing typical cardiac gene expression and epigenetic signatures and to evaluate the role non-coding genetic variants play in influencing cardiac molecular phenotypes. In this fellowship, I propose to conduct further computational analyses of these datasets to prove that iPSC-CMs are a powerful model to study genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying cardiac biology and cardiovascular disease. In a second project, I am studying the molecular effect of a long QT type II mutation segregating in this family with incomplete penetrance. The mutation causes a truncation of KCNH2 resulting in NMD of its transcript. In this fellowship I propose to characterize the electrophysiological properties of iPSC-CMs from the individuals of this family to determine if there are differences between the affected individuals, asymptomatic individuals carrying the mutation and control family members.

Phenotypic variability is indeed increasingly thought to be a product of the interaction of many genetic variants with each other and the environment. Similarly, the response to an environmental challenge, such as sleep deprivation, is conditioned by each individual’s genetic background. Moreover, although variants in coding regions of the genome certainly play essential roles, recent studies document the importance of variants in non-coding regulatory elements in predicting a phenotypic response. Regulatory elements (e.g. enhancers, silencers, promotors) and their activity can be readily identified by the presence of specific epigenetic marks; i.e., modifications of the DNA and the chromatin structure that do not affect the nucleotide sequence itself. The presence of epigenetic marks at genomic loci can depend on the underlying genotypes and on external influences, which makes them the long sought-after readable interface between genes and the environment.We have recently completed a project in which the effects of sleep deprivation were studied in a genetic reference population of mice to perform higher-order, system-level analyses integrating high-resolution genotype information with transcriptome, metabolome, and sleep/wake phenome data. This resource is the ideal starting point to profile the epigenomic consequences of the impact of sleep deprivation in genetically diverse individuals (Aim 1). We will profile and quantify open chromatin by ATAC-sequencing and contrast non-sleep deprived and sleep deprived conditions. We then will exploit these results to predict the transcription factors (TF) binding to the differentially accessible regulatory elements (Aim 2) by means of TF footprint analysis. The role of some of the transcription factors and regulatory elements identified under this aim in modulating the response to sleep loss can be directly validated in available mouse models or in other model species. Finally, in an already ongoing study, we aim to quantify both the short- and long-term transcriptomic and epigenomic consequences of sleep deprivation (Aim 3). Although no funding is sought for this third aim, it nevertheless is an integral part of the overall project as it allows interpreting the Aim 1 and 2 results in a homeostatic context.In addition to providing much needed new insights into the cellular basis of sleep homeostasis, this proposal is, to our knowledge, the first to comprehensively interrogate gene x environment interactions at the epigenomic level. With our approach, we are considering not only gene expression as a function of genotype and sleep deprivation, but also incorporate regulatory elements and their interactions to unveil higher-order regulatory networks and how these depend on genetic variants. The overarching aim of this proposal is thus to uncover elements, variants, and interactions (including the proteins involved), that are critical for coping with sleep loss.

52	Pierre Meister	University of Berne	Institut für Zellbiologie Departement Biologie Universität Bern	2011-09-01	2015-08-31	Deciphering the Function of Genome Nuclear Organization in Cell Fate Determination.	The process of cellular development and differentiation requires rapid and highly regulated changes in transcriptional profiles for the establishment of defined cell types. This has previously been correlated with large-scale changes in ‘epigenomic’ maps (transcription factor binding sites, histone tail modifications, DNA methylation). However, one exciting aspect of this, that is only recently being appreciated, is that the 3D organization of the genome also undergoes drastic modification. Regulating nuclear organization may be a general control mechanism for processes such as transcription. Indeed, across several species, gene expression is correlated with nuclear localization. Moreover, a number of inherited human diseases affecting specific tissues have been shown to be linked with mutations in structural components of the nucleus. Altogether, the data strongly suggests a link between the 3D nuclear organization of the genome and cell fate acquisition and maintenance. What has been missing in the field is the ability to move from the descriptive to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and the role they play during development. To this end, I started studying the nuclear positioning of developmentally regulated genes in the genetically tractable nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The goal of my project is to understand the function of the 3D nuclear organization of the genome in cell fate acquisition. Worms are an ideal model, as the entire developmental history of each cell is known and is invariant. Moreover, the precise timing of cell fate acquisition is also known. Hence, single differentiating cells can be studied in their native multicellular environment. Using a combination of microscopy, biochemistry and genetics coupled to computational modeling, I will address the function of nuclear organization in this complex system by focusing on the following questions:1.How is cell fate acquisition correlated to nuclear organization? How is genome 3D structure propagated once cells are committed to a certain cell fate?The C.elegans system will allow us, for the first time, to create maps of chromosome position during the development of an entire animal. Using genetic tools, I will uncover the rules governing genome organization, focusing on identifying the DNA elements necessary to locate and maintain genes at their proper place.2.Does gene positioning have an effect on transcription and cell identity? The genetic determinants involved in the structural changes of the nucleus remain largely unknown. I will characterize biochemically the factors involved in gene localization, and test their function in genome organization and cell fate maintenance during worm development. Since much of the machinery involved in chromatin transactions is evolutionarily conserved, this knowledge will improve our understanding of cell fate acquisition and maintenance not only in worms but in more complex animals where such studies are not yet possible. Likely factors involved in nuclear organization in worms will also shed light on the mechanisms that underlie nuclear and cellular (re)programming during stem cell maintenance, cell differentiation and carcinogenesis. This basic knowledge is likely to have future applications in human disease diagnosis, therapeutics and bioengineering.	Swiss National Science Foundation	SNSF Professorships	1536068.0	CHF
53	Markus Stoffel	ETH Zurich	Molekulare Gesundheitswissenschaften Departement Biologie ETH Zürich	2016-01-01	2016-12-31	A platform for quantitative genomic single cell analysis	Multicellular organisms are composed of many different specialized cell types. Organ function and ultimately phenotypic traits are the result of the interplay of their heterogeneous cell populations. Knowledge about the heterogeneity of gene expression patterns and interplay of different cell types is of great importance to basic and clinical research, but is still limited due to a lack of the high-resolution analysis of genomes or transcriptomes from single cells. The recent introduction of novel single cell resolved measurement techniques enable the generation of comprehensive data on the level of single genomes and proteoms. These techniques are likely to revolutionize our understanding of the scale of genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic diversity that occurs during organ development, stress conditions, aging, oncogenesis and tumor progression. In this application we propose to establish a single cell genomic platform through the purchase of a C1 single cell auto prep system from Fluidigm. This new technology enables to rapidly isolate, process, and profile individual cells for genomic analysis. Several SNSF funded groups from three different departments at ETH (D-BIOL, D-HEST, D-CHAB) have a strong commitment to establish a single cell analytics technology platform at ETH Zurich to study cell-to-cell variability in gene expression in diverse biological systems ranging from cancer biology to metabolism and to make this technology available to the larger Zurich scientific community. ETH is uniquely positioned to support this single cell analytics approach through the integration with its three established central technology platforms, including the Flow Cytometry Unit, the Functional Genomics Center Zurich (FGCZ) and the ICT unit of Personalized Health Technology (NEXUS), which provides services to biomedical researchers in data management and analysis. A comprehensive workflow among these three platforms complemented by the C1 single cell auto prep system will facilitate users from ETH and the University of Zurich to analyze complex and diverse biological systems on the single cell levels using fluorescent activated cell soring, microfluidics, single cell RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis.

Given the fact that all these cells share the same identical genetic blueprint, understanding how the information encoded in the DNA sequence is utilized for cell type-specific function is one of the most fascinating questions of modern biology. Cell type-specific readout of the genetic information results in specific gene expression programs that give rise to unique cellular phenotypes. These patterns have to be faithfully established and maintained once the cell commits to a certain fate. Failure to do so leads to various diseases, including cancer. Although, DNA sequence-specific transcription factors are the key regulators behind these events, chemical modifications of DNA and histones provide additional “epigenetic” layers of regulation. DNA methylation is the paradigm epigenetic modification associated with transcriptional repression in animals, plants and fungi. Its correct deposition is relevant for genome function and development, and is often disturbed in human diseases. While at promoters this modification is associated with transcriptional repression, methylation within the bodies of transcribed genes is compatible with active transcription. Furthermore, its tight correlation to the underlying gene activity suggests that methylation could be required for transcription fidelity and mRNA maturation, two highly relevant processes for determining gene expression programs and cellular identity. So far it remained elusive how the same chemical modification of DNA can exert two opposing functions at promoters and gene bodies. We will address this question by dissecting the mechanisms underlying this context-dependent regulation and readout of DNA methylation in the mouse genome. Towards this we will employ a combination of functional genomics, genome engineering and computational biology approaches in mouse embryonic stem cells models.These results are expected to shed light on the dual role of DNA methylation in promoting gene silencing at promoters and transcriptional activity at gene bodies. Given the frequent perturbation of DNA methylation in various diseases, the gained knowledge will be relevant for novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

These genetic associations are well characterised, yet the underlying mechanism remains unresolved. We derived VSMC from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS-VSMC), and identified an important effect of the chr9p21 genetic risk variants; increased sensitivity to IL-1/TLR signalling, through increased interleukin (IL)-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) expression. Our pilot data indicates differential transcriptional activity, and are supportive of differential epigenetic modifications, at the IRAK4 locus, in risk and non-risk iPS-VSMC. We propose to use our iPS-VSMC to delineate the mechanism linking the chr9p21 risk variants to IRAK4 expression. We will use genome-wide epigenomic profiling combined with RNA-Seq to guide us in characterising the important regulatory elements and epigenetic processes operating at the IRAK4 locus and influenced by the chr9p21 risk variants, in anticipation that resolving this mechanism will reveal novel therapeutic targets.

Investigate how abnormal epigenetic gene regulatory mechanisms result in differentiation block and leukaemic transformation in IDHm AML. 2. Investigate the molecular mechanisms of action of mutant IDH inhibitors in inducing differentiation of AML, focusing on effects on transcription factors involved in normal granulocyte-monocyte (GM) differentiation. Methodology 1. Compare gene expression, DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility, performed in parallel (multi-genomics) in normal bone marrow versus AML. Perform unbiased genome-wide bioinformatic analysis, and analysis focused on differentially expressed transcription factors required for normal GM differentiation (GM-TFs) but suppressed in AML. 2. Test the hypothesis that failure to express GM-TFs results in leukaemic transformation using CRISPR knockdown of candidate GM-TFs in IDH1-mutant preleukaemic mouse model. 3. Perform multi-genomic sequencing on mIDHi-treated AML LSC in vitro to investigate how mIDHi upregulates GM-TFs. Identify GM-TFs upregulated with mIDHi in responsive AML samples but which remain repressed in non-responsive samples. Test if re-expression restores response in resistant AML samples. 4. Correlate GM-TFs required for response (from point 3) with gene expression in IDHm AML patients who are resistant to mIDHi treatment in vivo. These may be important targets for novel therapies. Applications and benefits This work will improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of differentiation block and its contribution to pathogenesis of AML. It will help explain why differentiation therapies may not cure patients. The data has the potential to identify new genes/ pathways that should be targeted by novel therapies to improve clinical outcomes. It will provide the rationale for design of future clinical trials of combination therapy.

Aim 2: We will develop and make readily accessible the causal analysis methods and tools and apply Mendelian randomization (MR) to epigenetic questions. Aim 3: We will use DNA methylation as an index of past exposures to improve our prediction of disease risk and prognosis. Aim 4: From neurodevelopment to cancer, there are a multitude of settings in which we can apply epigenetic epidemiology to understand disease mechanisms and predict disease. Methods: We will utilize multiple data sources; from in-house studies, via collaborations and consortia, and through publicly accessible repositories. Our primary focus will be on the analysis of DNA methylation, as this continues to be the most readily available source of epigenetic data in population-based studies. However, we will integrate these data with newly generated and publicly available epigenomic and transcriptomic data, tissue-specific data and histone modification data. A wide range of methods will be applied. These include mQTL analysis, functional annotation and machine learning approaches, such as penalized regression, support vector machines, and neural networks. We will test for mediation using MR and apply our prediction methods in disease relevant datasets. Translation: The output arising from this programme will be used to develop biomarkers of disease risk and disease prognosis. It will also shed light on the genetic architecture of DNA methylation and the causal role this molecular phenotype plays in development and disease, which will in turn inform future interventions.

This has provided an initial experimental framework, and testable predictions for extrinsic and intrinsic factors needed for further development of PGCs. PGC specific reporter cell lines will provide development-monitoring assays for advanced PGCs by high-throughput live cell imaging. Long-term culture with hourly quantitative information of the fluorescence activation allows for simultaneous testing of 576 conditions. We will screen for cytokines and small compounds to stimulate development of PGCs, using the candidates identified by bioinformatic modeling, complemented by unbiased screening with commercial compound libraries, including small molecules to lower the epigenetic barriers for development. For intrinsic factors, we will focus on transcriptional factors that are specifically activated sequentially in vivo PGCs. We will conduct co-culture of nascent PGCs with human/porcine gonadal or Sertoli cells to provide a favorable niche, combined with extrinsic and/or intrinsic approaches to increase the probability of finding the best conditions for PGC development. Our immediate aim is combine all the information to generate equivalent of ~Wk10 PGCs in culture, which covers a period of significant epigenetic program leading to comprehensive erasure of DNA methylation. These PGCs will be compared bioinformatically with in vivo gonadal counterparts, gametes and seminoma. We aim to understand the overall mechanisms that regulate PGC development, together with the mechanisms of germ cell programming, as well as causes of disorders, by using patient specific iPSCs and gene modifications. We will also perform global gene inhibition and activation screening with CRISPR/Cas9. When appropriate, we will collaborate on some aspects, for example on the mitochondrial bottleneck and purification in early PGCs.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	637331.0	GBP

BACKGROUND: Epigenetic and gene expression changes during development play crucial roles in determining cell fate. Insults during this time can cause abnormalities in these mechanisms and lead to diseases later in life, such as schizophrenia or ADHD. Determining the genomic regions that undergo changes during early development is essential to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in development and developmental disorders. To this date, no study has identified the genome-wide epigenetic and gene expression changes that occur in different cell types across several stages of early development. APPROACH: I will characterize the regulatory changes in specific cell populations during early development and identify potential targets for pharmaceutical therapies for neurodevelopmental disorders. Firstly, I will isolate purified cell populations from different tissue structures of the zebrafish embryo at different stages of development. These will be isolated using dissection and aspiration and/or cell sorting technologies. I will then characterise dynamic changes in histone modifications, DNA modifications, open chromatin and gene expression in each of these cell populations, using different genome-wide sequencing methods. To analyse these data I will use statistical methods and bioinformatics analyses. Finally, the epigenomic and transcriptomic changes involved in development identified during my fellowship will be compared to the existing genomics and transcriptomic datasets at Eli Lilly (in collaboration with the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium) to help identify potential pharmaceutical targets for neuropsychiatric disorders with developmental origins.

We have collected oesophageal tissue samples from 1933 patients with detailed clinical annotation. We have developed a quality-controlled pipeline for pathology review and extraction of DNA and RNA from tiny amounts of endoscopic and surgical material. We are on target to obtain raw whole genome sequence (WGS) from 1000 samples (tumour and germline reference) by March 2016. We have developed an in-house analysis pipeline that has proved internationally competitive in the ICGC benchmarking tests, and made this pipeline available. We have developed methods for the analysis of mobile element insertions and PCR duplicate detection with code available for wide-spread use. Cataloguing of somatic mutations is near completion for over 250 cases. Results obtained so far have been published in high quality journals (including two in Nature Genetics), and associated raw data have been made available to the research community by deposition at the EBI. Aims and Methods: 1) To maintain the OCCAMS infrastructure to complete the task of cataloguing the mutations from the 1000 genomes to a robust and reproducibly high standard and make the entire set of results publicly accessible with comprehensive linked clinical data. 2) To perform DNA sequencing (WGS, exomes, targeted re-sequencing) on additional samples that have already been collected is required. This will make the catalogue representative given the inter and intra-tumour heterogeneity and inform us about disease evolution and response to therapy. 3) To add transcriptome and epigenomic data to WGS to provide the gold standard for this tumour set 4) To continue sample collection, including longitudinal tissue samples and blood for ctDNA analysis, to enable clinically relevant findings to be confirmed in independent cases. The following questions will be addressed: - What are molecular sub-classifications of oesophageal adenocarcinoma and how do they relate to outcome? - How does this disease evolve from pre-cancer (Barrett?s) to metastasis? - Are there tissue and blood biomarkers of disease progression? - What are the predictors of response to chemotherapy? - Can we identify new therapeutic targets or treatment algorithms? - Can ctDNA predict prognosis and response to treatment in a personalised fashion?

65	Professor Rebecca Fitzgerald	University of Cambridge	None	2016-04-01	2021-03-31	Oesophageal International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) Project	This award is for the sample collection for the ICGC Programme - the collection will be available to research community any type of research that is approved i.e. basic biology, aetiology, diagnostics, drug discovery. 2-3 tumour samples will be taken per patient (at biopsy and at post-chemotherapy surgery) and clinical data on each patient will also be collected. The oesophageal ICGC project embedded within the OCCAMS (Oesophageal Cancer Clinical and Molecular Stratification) consortium commenced in 2010. We have collected oesophageal tissue samples from 1933 patients with detailed clinical annotation. We have developed a quality-controlled pipeline for pathology review and extraction of DNA and RNA from tiny amounts of endoscopic and surgical material. We are on target to obtain raw whole genome sequence (WGS) from 1000 samples (tumour and germline reference) by March 2016. We have developed an in-house analysis pipeline that has proved internationally competitive in the ICGC benchmarking tests, and made this pipeline available. We have developed methods for the analysis of mobile element insertions and PCR duplicate detection with code available for wide-spread use. Cataloguing of somatic mutations is near completion for over 250 cases. Results obtained so far have been published in high quality journals (including two in Nature Genetics), and associated raw data have been made available to the research community by deposition at the EBI. Aims and Methods: 1) To maintain the OCCAMS infrastructure to complete the task of cataloguing the mutations from the 1000 genomes to a robust and reproducibly high standard and make the entire set of results publicly accessible with comprehensive linked clinical data. 2) To perform DNA sequencing (WGS, exomes, targeted re-sequencing) on additional samples that have already been collected is required. This will make the catalogue representative given the inter and intra-tumour heterogeneity and inform us about disease evolution and response to therapy. 3) To add transcriptome and epigenomic data to WGS to provide the gold standard for this tumour set 4) To continue sample collection, including longitudinal tissue samples and blood for ctDNA analysis, to enable clinically relevant findings to be confirmed in independent cases. The following questions will be addressed: - What are molecular sub-classifications of oesophageal adenocarcinoma and how do they relate to outcome? - How does this disease evolve from pre-cancer (Barrett?s) to metastasis? - Are there tissue and blood biomarkers of disease progression? - What are the predictors of response to chemotherapy? - Can we identify new therapeutic targets or treatment algorithms? - Can ctDNA predict prognosis and response to treatment in a personalised fashion? The clinical management of oesophageal adenocarcinoma could be transformed by the integration of ?omics technologies into clinical care pathways and the OCCAMS consortium are ideally placed to contribute to this endeavour.

Background: Cancer clones emerge and evolve through somatic mutation acquisition and Darwinian selection, but the dynamics of clonal evolution remain poorly understood and predicting disease progression remains a real challenge. Genes that regulate the epigenome are clearly important targets of mutations in cancer, but the mechanisms by which they drive tumour evolution remain unknown. The myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are haematopoietic disorders that represent an excellent model to study genomic and epigenomic evolution in human cancers: (i) They are genetically well-defined with disease driving mutations in JAK2, CALR (which I described in 2013) or MPL, present alongside mutations in epigenetic regulators, such as, DNMT3A. (ii) Disease can be either stable, or progress to leukaemia or myelofibrosis, providing the opportunity to study the basis for these evolutionary differences, and (iii) Primary cells can be serially sampled at the clonal level enabling inter- and intra-clonal studies. Aims: My key goal is to understand the genetic and epigenetic basis of clonal evolution in MPNs. Specifically, 1. I will determine the mutational patterns, mutational processes and clonal dynamics underlying disease stability versus progression. 2. I will study the aberrations in DNA methylation resulting from mutations in DNMT3A (and later TET2), at the clonal level in MPNs to understand how DNA methylation drives clonal evolution. Methods: 1. Whole-genome sequencing of 2-3 disease time-points in 32 MPN patients with either stable or progressed disease has completed. Genome-wide somatic mutations will be analysed and the absolute timing of genetic events in relation to disease phenotype will be determined using targeted sequencing of further disease timepoints. Mutational processes and clonal dynamics underlying disease evolution will be determined by studying subclonal architectures, mutational signatures and rates of mutation acquisition. 2. Whole-genome bisulphite sequencing of individual single-cell derived haematopoietic colonies will be performed in 15 DNMT3A- or TET2-mutated MPNs. Perturbations in DNA methylation across patients, between genetic subclones, between colonies of the same genotype, and within individual colonies, will address the mechanisms by which DNA methylation dysregulation contributes to clonal evolution. How the results of this research will be used: This study will provide information on why MPNs remains stable in some but unfortunately progress in others, and which patients may be at risk of future disease progression. Deciphering DNA methylation perturbations at a clonal level will provide unprecedented insight into the epigenetic mechanisms that drive clonal haematopoiesis and evolution. The evolutionary insights gained will be relevant to other cancers.	Cancer Research UK	CCC - Clinician Scientist Fellowship	None	None

However, our ability to decipher DNA variants is still largely limited to protein-coding exons, which comprise 1% of the genome. Most known Mendelian mutations are in exons, yet genetic testing still fails to show causal coding mutations in more than 50% of well-characterized Mendelian disorders. This defines a pressing need to interpret noncoding genome sequences, and to establish the role of noncoding mutations in Mendelian disease. A recent case study harnessed whole genome sequencing, epigenomics, and functional genomics to show that mutations in an enhancer cause most cases of neonatal diabetes due to pancreas agenesis. This example raises major questions: (i) what is the overall impact of penetrant regulatory mutations in human diabetes? (ii) do regulatory mutations cause distinct forms of diabetes? (iii) more generally, can we develop a strategy to systematically tackle regulatory variation in Mendelian disease? The current project will address these questions with unique resources. First, we have created epigenomic and functional perturbation resources to interpret the regulatory genome in embryonic pancreas and adult pancreatic islets. Second, we have collected an unprecedented international cohort of patients with a phenotype consistent with monogenic diabetes, yet lacking mutations in known gene culprits after genetic testing, and therefore with increased likelihood of harboring noncoding mutations. Third, we have developed a prototype platform to sequence regulatory mutations in a large number of patients. These resources will be combined with innovative strategies to uncover causal enhancer mutations underlying Mendelian diabetes. If successful, this project will expand the diagnostic spectrum of diabetes, it will discover new genetic regulators of diabetes-relevant networks, and will provide a framework to understand regulatory variation in Mendelian disease.

68	Dr Laura EME	CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS	None	2019-03-01	2024-02-29	The macroevolutionary impact of epigenetics and lateral gene transfer on eukaryotic genomes	Multicellular organisms (e.g., animals, fungi and plants) are the best-studied eukaryotes but their ancestors and the vast majority of eukaryotic diversity correspond to microbial species (“protists”). The evolutionary history of protists is closely connected to the evolution of the eukaryotic cell itself. However, most protist diversity is still genomically unexplored, limiting our investigation of eukaryotic evolution. For example, while the importance of lateral gene transfer (LGT) in prokaryotic evolution is well recognized, its role in eukaryotic evolution is still debated. In addition, although epigenetic mechanisms represent a hallmark of eukaryotic genome regulation, we know surprisingly little about the evolution of these mechanisms across eukaryotic diversity. The overarching goal of my project is to understand how epigenetic mechanisms and LGT have shaped the macroevolution of eukaryotic genomes. This project has several inter-related intermediate objectives, which each in themselves will bring crucial insights into eukaryotic evolution: 1) reconstructing a robust phylogeny of eukaryotes; 2) inferring the gene content of the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor; 3) tracing the evolution of genes involved in epigenetic mechanisms and obtaining epigenomic maps from under-studied protists; 4) investigating the intriguing hypothesis of a possible interplay between epigenetic regulation and horizontal gene transfer and its influence on eukaryotic genome evolution: Have genes involved in epigenomic mechanisms been transferred between eukaryotes? Do epigenomic modifications affect the frequency of LGT in different lineages? To achieve this, I will characterize the transcriptomes, genomes, methylomes and small RNAs of understudied eukaryotic microbes selected for their key phylogenetic position, and to analyse them using state-of-the-art bioinformatic methods. I will target uncultivated protists, using single-cell techniques and novel genome-scaffolding approaches.	European Research Council	Starting Grant	1499945.0	EUR
69	Prof. Edith HEARD	Institut Curie	None	2015-11-01	2020-10-31	Exploring mechanisms of gene repression and escape during X-chromosome inactivation	During mammalian development, precise gene expression patterns have to be established and then maintained, or reversed, in different cellular and tissue contexts. A striking example of such developmentally regulated gene control is X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), whereby one of the two X chromosomes in females is silenced during embryogenesis. XCI is initiated by the non-coding Xist RNA, which coats the chromosome in cis, triggering gene repression, chromatin changes and chromosomal reorganisation. Although Xist’s regulation has been investigated intensively, less is known about the actual mechanisms underlying the process of chromosome-wide gene silencing that it induces. Indeed, X-linked loci show very different kinetics of repression during development, implying regional and/or locus specific diversity. Furthermore, some genes avoid or escape XCI altogether, either constitutively or in a tissue or stage-specific fashion, but the molecular basis for this is unclear. Here we propose to dissect the mechanisms underlying gene regulation during XCI. We will investigate the roles of recently identified Xist partners in gene silencing and perform genetic screens to identify new factors involved in silencing and escape from XCI. Transcription, chromatin status and chromosome conformation during XCI will be investigated in an allelic-specific manner during precise developmental time windows to pinpoint the critical changes accompanying silencing and escape. We will use genetic engineering to alter genomic and epigenomic landscapes of selected loci and target candidate trans-acting factors to their putative regulatory elements. Finally, we will develop tools to explore gene expression during XCI using live cell imaging of embryogenesis. Using this innovative set of approaches, we hope to define both general principles underlying gene silencing and escape in XCI, as well as locus-specific features that could serve as new paradigms for research in developmental epigenetics.

70	Prof Simak Ali	Imperial College London	None	2018-06-04	2021-06-03	Developing strategies for treatment of breast cancer patients following progression on CDK4/6 inhibitors	Dysregulation of cell cycle control involving CDK4/6 is common in ER+ breast cancer (BC) and the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib plus endocrine-therapy (ET), improves clinical outcome in advanced post-menopausal ER+/HER2-ve disease. However, resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors is an emerging problem. To ascertain mechanisms of response/resistance to palbociclib, we generated cell line models of acquired palbociclib resistance as monotherapy, or in estrogen-deprivation resistance models. Key to palbociclib resistance is altered CDK signalling, chiefly loss of RB1 and/or amplification/over-expression of CDK2, CDK4, CCNE1 and CDK7. siRNA library screening demonstrated dependence of palbociclib-resistant cells on CDK2, CDK4, CDK9 and CDK7. CDK7 is required for activation of cell cycle CDK1/2/4/6. CDK7 also controls transcription initiation by phosphorylating RNA polymerase II and CDK9, with particular sensitivity of super-enhancers that direct expression of cancer drivers, to CDK7 inhibition. Perturbation of CDK7 prevents transcription of key cell cycle drivers. Aims: We will (i) establish mechanisms of palbociclib resistance, focusing on redundancy of cyclin dependent kinases (CDK) and (ii) address the modulating role of CDK7 and its utility as a therapeutic target in overcoming resistance. Techniques/Methodology: Ectopic expression of CDKs upregulated in palbociclib resistance and specific inhibitors of these CDKs will be used to define their relative contribution in models of palbociclib sensitive and resistant BC. Proteomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic methodologies will identify the importance of cell cycle and transcription inhibition in resistance and potential of CDK7 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy. Findings will be validated in palbociclib resistant patient-derived tumour xenografts/organoids. Impact on Breast Cancer Research: Defining the mechanisms of palbociclib resistance and utility of CDK7 inhibition to overcome this will be an important advance. Importantly, rapid progression to the clinic is feasible, as several CDK7 inhibitors showing remarkable lack of toxicity in pre-clinical in vivo models have been developed, with one already advanced to phase I.

Their capacity to differentiate into specific neuronal cell types allows researchers to observe human neural development under normal conditions, but also under the influence of disease-causing agents. To date however, the majority of such studies have focussed only on either genetic or environmental drivers of disease. In fact, gene x environment interactions are thought to be critical in shaping an individuals risk for developing NDD and the likely clinical outcome, particularly if the interactions occur during critical periods of fetal brain development. Therefore, if hIPSC are to truly deliver on their potential, the challenge is to use them to study the combination of genetic and environmental disease risk factors, ideally in a cell specific manner, which has the potential to be a highly relevant model to study the biological causes of NDD using a human model system. In this context, both epidemiology and animal models provide evidence for a link between maternal immune activation (MIA) during pregnancy and increased risk for NDD (including ASD and SZ), in the affected offspring. Despite this, several key gaps in our knowledge remain. First, how does MIA affect human neural developmental at the genomic and epigenomic level? Second, how do these influences map onto known genetic risk mechanisms associated with NDD? For example, is the effect of MIA via an influence on high confidence genes associated with NDD? If so, what classes of genetic variants are then most highly affected? Furthermore, can MIA induce pathological changes in gene expression in the developing brain that shares similarities with gene expression dysregulation found in both children and adults with NDD? Conversely, what gene expression pathology is present in the MIA-exposed developing brain that is absent in older children and adults with NDD? Finally, can we identify specific mechanistic pathways that MIA impacts on that are highly relevant for NDD? Whilst studies in animal models have gone a long way to addressing some of these questions, there is a pressing need to translate these findings into human model systems. This is due to critical species differences in the development of human and animal brains, both in terms of gene regulatory networks and cellular proliferative behaviour. Therefore, we propose to develop a human cellular model of MIA using hIPSC, which can be applied to neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from keratinocytes obtained from healthy controls and individuals with highly penetrant disease-causing mutations for NDD such as major deletions in the chromsome 22q region, which confer risk for ASD and SZ. This in vitro approach will provide a robust human cell-based model of MIA, which can replace a large number of animal models that are the only currently available alternative. In doing so, our proposal will deliver the following impacts: (1) Broaden the potential of hIPSCs in gene x environment interaction modelling, leading to a significant reduction in the number of rodents and non-human primates used in MIA models. (2) Establish the relevance of the extant animal data for human health and disease (3) Elucidate causal and human relevant molecular and cellular mechanisms driving the adverse effects of MIA on human neocortical development, increasing our understanding of key mechanistic links as to how MIA may confer risk for later development of NDD (4) Accelerate the development of potential therapeutic targets for specific environmental risk factors that may be more amenable to prevention and/or treatment later in life, than genetic etiologies.

Key in understanding cellular specification is to elucidate the epigenetic mechanism that underlies transcriptional heterogeneity. Thus a central question in biology is how cell-to-cell variability in the epigenome contributes to the emergence of phenotypic differences. However, current techniques to profile the epigenome require populations of cells and consequently present ensemble averages of the underlying biology. Therefore, to grasp the molecular concept behind the cellular acquisition of heritable traits it is essential to develop techniques to profile the epigenome at the single-cell level. The advent of single-cell genomics enabled profiling of few epigenetic features and transcriptomics in single cells; however, this toolbox is still very restricted and moreover, to directly correlate the variability in the epigenome to changes in gene-expression activity it is pivotal to device methods to obtain both measurements from the same cell. Therefore, to bridge these shortcomings in the epigenetic toolbox, we plan to develop and apply novel techniques to profile the epigenome in single cells. With this proposal we aim to (1) develop a method to map histone modifications in single cells (2) develop a method to map chromatin organization in single cells (3) develop a method to obtain combined measurements of the epigenome and the transcriptome of the same cell (4) apply these and previously developed single-cell methods, to different biological systems to study how the epigenome contributes to lineage specification. Collectively, the goal of this proposal is to develop a comprehensive single-cell toolbox to take the field to the next (epigenomic) level and to work towards elucidating the molecular mechanism behind cellular specification.

73	Dr William Scott	MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences	None	2018-03-01	2021-03-31	Clinical Lecturer in Endocrinology	Obesity affects >600M people worldwide, accounts for ~60% of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and ~20% of cardiovascular disease, and causes >3M deaths each year. Better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying obesity and its metabolic complications is essential for development of much needed new therapeutics. Epigenetic programming of gene expression and cell functions in response to genetic and environmental exposures is widely implicated in human obesity and metabolic disease pathogenesis. In exploratory human studies, epigenomic variations and their enzymatic regulators are widely associated with obesity phenotypes and major aetiological risk factors. However, examples of causal epigenomic variants in humans are very limited. A major goal of our research is to identify human epigenomic variations and subsequent responses in gene expression that impact obesity phenotypes, then exploit their therapeutic potential. Our strategy is to use high-throughput genomics to discover cell-type specific epigenomic variations linked to human obesity, then state-of-the-art genome-editing tools to assign causation to these variants and their target genes. The discovery of causal human epigenomic changes is a prerequisite for leveraging the therapeutic potential of these reversible mechanisms of disease. Adipose tissue cell-types are the primary focus of our research because of their key roles in obesity and metabolic disease pathogenesis – excess energy storage (white adipocytes), reduced inducible thermogenic energy expenditure (beige adipocytes), and adipo/cytokines effects on systemic energy balance, inflammation and insulin sensitivity (white and beige adipocytes in cross-talk with macrophages and other immune cells). We have used integrated genomic strategies to discover alterations in adipocyte DNA methylation, an important epigenetic mechanism, robustly associated with human obesity and their predicted effector transcripts (cis- target genes). These loci may contribute to human obesity phenotypes if DNA methylation actively regulates the expression of cis- target genes with critical adipocyte functions. Our immediate aim is to establish the cause-and-effect relationships between DNA methylation, cis- target gene expression and disease phenotype, and the underlying mechanisms-of-action, at these loci. Our strategy is to combine complementary lines of evidence from human functional genomics (e.g. targeted bisulfite sequencing, Capture HiC, transcription factor motif analyses), in vitro epigenetic editing (CRISPR-cas9) and in vivo mouse genetic manipulation (Cre-Lox). In parallel, we are developing single cell sequencing approaches to investigate epigenomic and transcriptomic mechanisms in other major adipose tissue cell types – macrophages, other immune and stromovascular cells, adipocyte precursors – underlying human obesity, metabolic dysfunction and weight loss. By intersecting results from epigenomics, genetics, molecular signaling and physiology, our work will deliver new insights into mechanisms of disease in human adipocytes, and a range of translational research targets for obesity and T2D.

Yet, epigenome integrity is challenged during all DNA transactions, including DNA damage repair. While much effort has been devoted to characterizing chromatin alterations in response to DNA damage and how they contribute to the repair response, our knowledge of this fundamental process is largely incomplete, and whether and how epigenetic features are re-established following a genotoxic stress challenge is still unexplored. Thus, a comprehensive framework of the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of epigenome integrity in response to DNA damage is lacking. The present project aims to fill this important gap by profiling the epigenome of repair patches following UVC damage in human cells and by characterizing the molecular players contributing to chromatin restoration/plasticity. I propose an integrated approach that tackles this question at different levels of chromatin organization, from histone and DNA modifications up to higher-order chromatin folding. Building on our unique expertise and through the development of powerful novel methodologies, combining cutting-edge imaging, proteomics and epigenomic technologies, we will elucidate mechanisms for (1) histone modification re-establishment and maintenance and (2) DNA methylation inheritance at repair sites. We will also investigate how repair-associated changes in DNA and histone modifications reflect at the level of (3) higher-order chromatin organization in the tridimensional nuclear space, and dissect (4) functional crosstalks between the epigenetic changes that arise in damaged chromatin. This ambitious research project represents an unprecedented effort towards a comprehensive and integrated understanding of epigenome maintenance mechanisms in response to genotoxic stress.

Our goal is to define the “ground-state” for lineage specification and understand the changes to this state that promote differentiation to specific lineages. As our experimental model, we study the vertebrate neural crest, a multipotent embryonic population, that gives rise to a plethora of derivatives, including peripheral neurons and glia, melanocytes, craniofacial cartilage and bone and many others. Due to its unique multipotency and lengthy development, the NC offers notable advantages for studies of cell fate. Our first objective is to uncover the fundamental mechanisms of triggering NC specification by exploring global changes to chromatin and cis-regulatory landscape that initiate the NC programme. Our second objective is to decipher and validate NC developmental trajectories and associated gene regulatory circuits controlling NC fate transitions. We will use a combination of epigenomic, proteomic, genome-editing and single-cell approaches in zebrafish embryos to establish the entire network of transcription factors and chromatin-associated proteins underpinning the process of NC cell fate specification and restriction. The uncovered general mechanisms can be applied to human embryonic stem cells and used in a therapeutic setting in the future.	Wellcome Trust	Senior Research Fellowship	2728040.0	GBP

While cleaner than fossil diesel emissions in terms of sulphur, CO and hydrocarbons, biodiesel emissions are rich in ultrafine particles and NOx and targeted studies indicate that they induce stronger inflammation and oxidative stress. Early omics screens demonstrated that the molecular interactions that drive pulmonary responses to biodiesel emissions differ from those caused by fossil-diesel exhaust. Combining mRNA and miRNA sequencing with epigenomic arrays, my research aims to characterise transcriptional dysregulation in the lungs of individuals who have been exposed to biodiesel emissions under controlled chamber conditions. This work is accompanied by a multi-platform metabonomic urinalysis, which explores non-invasively accessible signatures of susceptibility to biodiesel emission toxicity. Relatively little is known of wood smoke toxicity, but exposure has been shown to induce inflammation, cell death and genotoxicity in airway models. Mirroring my biodiesel study, I aim to characterise transcriptional dysregulation in the pulmonary tissue and activated inflammatory cells of exposed volunteers.

The ultimate goal of this research proposal is to study the chromatin architecture during normal and malignant T cell differentiation in order to define how DNA methylation drives oncogenic gene expression as a novel concept in cancer research. T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) accounts for 15% of pediatric and 25% of adult ALL cases and was originally identified as a highly aggressive tumor entity. T-ALL therapy has been intensified leading to gradual improvements in survival. However, 20% of pediatric and 50% of adult T-ALL cases still relapse and ultimately die because of refractory disease. Research efforts have unravelled the complex genetic basis of T-ALL but failed to identify new promising targets for precision therapy. Recent studies have identified a subset of T-ALLs whose transcriptional programs resemble those of early T-cell progenitors (ETPs), myeloid precursors and hematopoietic stem cells. Importantly, these so-called ETP-ALLs are characterized by early treatment failure and an extremely poor prognosis. The unique ETP-ALL gene expression signature suggests that the epigenomic landscape in ETP-ALL is markedly different as compared to other genetic subtypes of human T-ALL. My project aims to identify genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation and histone modifications in genetic subtypes of human T-ALL as a basis for elucidating how DNA methylation drives the expression of critical oncogenes in the context of poor prognostic ETP-ALL. Given that these ETP-ALL patients completely fail current chemotherapy treatment, tackling this completely novel aspect of ETP-ALL genetics will yield new targets for therapeutic intervention in this aggressive haematological malignancy.

Modern genomics and epigenomics provide us with catalogues of gene regulatory elements and maps illustrating their activity in different tissues. Nevertheless, we are far from being able to explain emergence and maintenance of cellular states from such data, partly because we so far lacked characterization of individual molecular states and genome control mechanisms at their native resolution - the single cell. Recently, new approaches developed by the single cell genomics community, with several contributions from our group, allow massive acquisition of data on the transcriptional, epigenomic and chromosomal conformation states in large cohorts of single cells. In this research program, we aim to move forward rapidly to bridge a major gap between these experimental breakthroughs and models of genome regulation in complex tissues. We will develop algorithms and models for representing data the transcriptional profiles, DNA methylation landscapes and Hi-C maps of literally millions of cells. Our tools will be designed specifically to leverage on new single cell RNA-seq, single cell Hi-C, single cell capture-pBat and higher order 4C-seq that we will continue to develop experimentally. Furthermore, we shall enhance and optimize our interdisciplinary framework hand in hand with a working model aiming at unprecedentedly comprehensive single cell analysis of E8-E10 mouse embryos. This will provide us with hundreds of worked-out cases of tissue specific gene regulation. The techniques and insights from these studies will then be used to characterize cell type aberrations and epigenetic reprogramming in tumors. The open algorithms, techniques and methodology we shall develop can accelerate research in multiple groups that will utilize single cell genomics to study numerous questions on gene regulation in the coming years.

BACKGROUND: Epigenetic and gene expression changes during development play crucial roles in determining cell fate. Insults during this time can cause abnormalities in these mechanisms and lead to diseases later in life, such as schizophrenia or ADHD. Determining the genomic regions that undergo changes during early development is essential to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in development and developmental disorders. To this date, no study has identified the genome-wide epigenetic and gene expression changes that occur in different cell types across several stages of early development. APPROACH: I will characterize the regulatory changes in specific cell populations during early development and identify potential targets for pharmaceutical therapies for neurodevelopmental disorders. Firstly, I will isolate purified cell populations from different tissue structures of the zebrafish embryo at different stages of development. These will be isolated using dissection and aspiration and/or cell sorting technologies. I will then characterise dynamic changes in histone modifications, DNA modifications, open chromatin and gene expression in each of these cell populations, using different genome-wide sequencing methods. To analyse these data I will use statistical methods and bioinformatics analyses. Finally, the epigenomic and transcriptomic changes involved in development identified during my fellowship will be compared to the existing genomics and transcriptomic datasets at Eli Lilly (in collaboration with the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium) to help identify potential pharmaceutical targets for neuropsychiatric disorders with developmental origins.

Age is a general riskfactor, though there is high-variance in the clinical course of COVID-19 in middle-aged patients,including mortality rates over 1% among patients in their 50's [3], [2]. Further, more than one quarter ofnon-survivors in a Wuhan study have no co-morbidities [1]. Non-survivors had elevated serum IL-6, andfeatures of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1], [2]. These findings have provided rationalefor initiation of trials to explore therapeutic efficacy of IL-1R and IL-6R blockade in COVID-19 [4]. Instudying epigenetic control of inflammatory genes, we have found that key immune genes in bloodprogenitors are variably regulated by epigenetic poising across individuals, with variability across age anddisease states. Herein, we aim to reveal specific genes, and epigenetic states of these genes, that mayunderlie morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 through use of sensitive epigenomic methods recentlydeveloped by the lab. This work will illuminate features of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and pathogenesis,which is of the utmost importance if we are to develop effective therapies and patient managementstrategies in a timely manner.

These mechanisms leave measurable marks on the genome, including DNA methylation, spatial patterns of nucleosomes and histone modifications. Hundreds of proteins are implicated in writing and reading these complex, dynamic patterns. While many writers are essential, loss-of-function experiments have, paradoxically, shown little effect on the corresponding marks or gene expression, suggesting a high degree of redundancy. To understand individual epigenetic components, their interactions and their impact on gene expression, wet-lab experiments need to be complemented by sophisticated machine learning (ML) efforts, which offer a unique way of extracting signals from high-dimensional, redundant data. We propose building dedicated ML tools that will have a wide range of applications in epigenetic research. Individual epigenomic marks are readily recorded using e.g. ChIP-Seq, providing static snapshots of epigenomic states. These data exhibit high-order spatial patterns as neighboring nucleosomes interact. Previously, I’ve developed ML tools to compare epigenetic signatures across different conditions / cell types. However cross-talk between writers and readers leads to correlations between individual marks, epigenetic signatures and gene expression, raising questions about their causal relationships. Aimung for a mechanistic understanding of these signatures, we will develop computational tools based on Kernel methods and the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion to find gene-specific epigenetic association networks and to relate them to gene expression. Then, multivariate spatio-temporal models of epigenomic time-series data will allow us to interpret the complex, potentially causal relationships between epigenomic changes and gene expression.

I wish to investigate the importance of these loci on gene regulation and the pathogenesis of PAH. This will involve in vitro studies using CRISPR inhibition, activation and gene editing approaches in relevant cells (pulmonary arterial endothelial cells) in combination with luciferase reporter assays, and functional read-outs. In silico analyses of available epigenomic data and predicted transcription factor (TF) binding sites along with electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) will allow identification of TFs whose binding is modified by the risk variants. This work is being done in collaboration with the Epigenomics Lab of Prof Jorge Ferrer at Imperial College. Furthermore, we have created knockout mice and rats lacking the conserved enhancer region, which will be assessed for functional impact on pulmonary vascular development and pathogenesis in PAH models including hypoxia and VEGFR2 inhibition by SUGEN. To investigate the clinical impact of this in other forms of pulmonary hypertension (PH) I will investigate the frequency of these variants in patients with different diagnoses of PH as part of the UK-wide collaborative network of which I am an active member and have previously obtained samples from for metabolomic and RNAseq analyses in PAH. I will combine these layers of omics data to define the effect of the genetic variation I have identified on patients profiles.	The Academy of Medical Sciences	Springboard Round 4	100000.0	GBP
83	Dr Ines Cebola	Imperial College London	None	2020-06-01	2022-05-31	Investigation of NAFLD-associated epigenetic dysregulation	This proposal aims to gain insights into the transcriptional and regulatory defects that associate with hepatic steatosis. To this end, we will: 1) Identify steatosis-responsive enhancers in human hepatocytes; 2) Link steady-state and stress-responsive hepatocyte enhancers to target genes; 3) Implement CRISPR/Cas9 editing tools in primary human hepatocytes for disease modelling. Currently, there is a lack of high-resolution maps of transcriptional enhancers for human liver, particularly of those that are stimuli- and stress-responsive. Given the enrichment of common disease genetic risk variants within transcriptional enhancers, this gap in knowledge may be limiting our power to prioritise and investigate causal variants that affect liver cell function. Here, we propose to expose human primary hepatocyte spheroids to pathophysiological concentrations of free fatty acids, carbohydrates and insulin, which were previously shown to induce changes in a select number of genes and induce lipogenesis, consistent with a steatosis-like hepatic state. We will apply RNA-seq and ATAC-seq to identify differentially active enhancers in hepatic spheroids with steatosis, which we will link to target genes by correlation analysis. The epigenomic maps will be integrated with metabolic trait genetic association datasets. As proof-of-principle, we will select and target one steatosis-modulated enhancer with CRISPR/Cas9 in human hepatocytes. Functional outcomes will be evaluated by qPCR and intracellular lipid quantification by FACS (BODIPY). This project is intended to provide proof-of-principle evidence that there is rewiring of the hepatic enhancer landscape in NAFLD-associated conditions. Furthermore, it is designed to lay the groundwork for future high-throughput liver cell enhancer functional screens.	The Academy of Medical Sciences	Springboard Round 5	99964.63	GBP

Investigate how abnormal epigenetic gene regulatory mechanisms result in differentiation block and leukaemic transformation in IDHm AML. 2. Investigate the molecular mechanisms of action of mutant IDH inhibitors in inducing differentiation of AML, focusing on effects on transcription factors involved in normal granulocyte-monocyte (GM) differentiation. Methodology 1. Compare gene expression, DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility, performed in parallel (multi-genomics) in normal bone marrow versus AML. Perform unbiased genome-wide bioinformatic analysis, and analysis focused on differentially expressed transcription factors required for normal GM differentiation (GM-TFs) but suppressed in AML. 2. Test the hypothesis that failure to express GM-TFs results in leukaemic transformation using CRISPR knockdown of candidate GM-TFs in IDH1-mutant preleukaemic mouse model. 3. Perform multi-genomic sequencing on mIDHi-treated AML LSC in vitro to investigate how mIDHi upregulates GM-TFs. Identify GM-TFs upregulated with mIDHi in responsive AML samples but which remain repressed in non-responsive samples. Test if re-expression restores response in resistant AML samples. 4. Correlate GM-TFs required for response (from point 3) with gene expression in IDHm AML patients who are resistant to mIDHi treatment in vivo. These may be important targets for novel therapies. Applications and benefits This work will improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of differentiation block and its contribution to pathogenesis of AML. It will help explain why differentiation therapies may not cure patients. The data has the potential to identify new genes/ pathways that should be targeted by novel therapies to improve clinical outcomes. It will provide the rationale for design of future clinical trials of combination therapy. Multi-genomic characterisation of patients may be useful as a prognostic tool, and to guide therapeutic decisions.	Medical Research Council	Fellowship	804610.0	GBP

Even non-cytolytic CD8+ T cell interactions, which purge viruses from neurons without triggering cell death, can induce permanent damage. Yet, how this immune response irreversibly disrupts neuronal homeostasis remains unclear. Here, we will elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underlie non-cytolytic CD8+ T cell engagement with infected neurons and their consequences on neuron function in vivo. We hypothesize that inflammatory signalling in neurons, induced by non-cytolytic CD8+ T cell interactions, triggers metabolic and epigenetic changes that underpin permanent neuronal dysfunction. "PATHOCODE" will test this hypothesis by harnessing a unique animal model of T cell-driven virus encephalitis in the following objectives: 1. Discern neuronal subset-specific vulnerabilities and antigen-dependent versus bystander effects in the inflamed CNS. We will perform single nucleus RNA sequencing to examine whether T cell engagement (a) differentially affects molecularly distinct neurons, and (b) affects non-targeted, uninfected neurons. 2. Uncover the consequences of non-cytolytic T cell engagement on neuronal metabolism. We will use cell-specific mitochondrial reporter mice to investigate immune-driven metabolic adaptation of neurons in vivo. 3. Determine how non-cytolytic T cell engagement affects the neuronal epigenome. We will employ cell-specific nucleus/ribosome reporter mice to elucidate how T cell engagement affects the translatome and epigenome of infected cells. 4. Rescue T cell-mediated neuronal dysfunction by restoring metabolic pathways. We will exploit recent CRISPR/Cas9 technological advances to restore neuronal gene expression and uncover the relevance of immune-driven metabolic and epigenomic changes to disease. Our study will thus provide novel molecular concepts about immune-driven neuronal alterations in CNS inflammatory diseases.	European Research Council	Consolidator Grant	1999954.0	EUR

Although small RNAs are essential for proper differentiation and epigenome regulation, little is known regarding their embryonic functions, especially in plants. Arabidopsis thaliana is a leading system to study the regulatory roles of small RNAs because of the abundance of genetic, genomic and epigenomic resources. Moreover, Arabidopsis embryos undergo invariant division patterns and rapidly differentiate to generate the most basic plant cell-types arranged in correct positions. Early Arabidopsis embryos are therefore morphologically simple structures composed of diverse cell types making them ideal for determining the influence of small RNAs on fundamental cellular differentiation and reprogramming events. The objectives of the proposed research are designed to assess the regulatory roles of small RNAs in establishing both the basic body plan and epigenome in plant embryos. We will utilize modified next-generation sequencing technologies to identify small RNAs present in developing embryos. Because we will generate these RNA profiles from a mixture of cell-types, we will also use a fluorescent protein-based approach to quantify specific miRNA repressive activities in individual cell-types. To determine the functions of individual miRNA/target interactions during embryogenesis, we will identify miRNAs required for embryo development and use genome-wide approaches to study specific miRNA/target interactions in greater detail. Lastly, we will use a fusion of genetic and genomic methods to determine how small RNAs influence the nascent epigenome during early embryogenesis.

Analysis of SARS-CoV2 IgG will be done. In Phase 2 (Sept-Dec 2020), all participants will be invited to a clinical follow-up, including lung function meansurements and blood sampling and new web survey. Phase 3 (Jan – March 2021) will be the same as Phase 1.Linkage with national and regional health registers will be done. Immune phenotyping and analyses of cellular immunity will be explored.

Genome-wide enhancer activities in heart tissue are dominated by cardiomyocytes and show low sequence conservation and considerable plasticity to stimuli such as pressure overload. The rapid turnover of heart regulatory regions across species suggests sequence conservation cannot faithfully predict the relevance of myocardial enhancers and their disease-associated variants.Combining comparative functional genomics, bioinformatics and molecular biology, I will first characterise enhancer evolution in heart tissue and its relationship to myocardial disease variants. Analysis of cardiomyocytes exposed to pathophysiological stress in human and mouse cells will identify candidate enhancers relevant to myocardial disease. Lastly, I will interrogate the impact of conserved cardiomyocyte enhancers on myocardial function via genome editing in human cardiomyocytes and mice. These experiments will test how evolutionary stability and plasticity to pathophysiological stress influence the impact of cardiomyocyte enhancers on myocardial function, providing insights into the regulatory mechanisms by which human non-coding variants impact myocardial diseases such as cardiomyopathies and conduction abnormalities.

89	Dr. Qi Zhou	University of Vienna	None	2016-08-01	2021-07-31	Evolution and Impact of Heterochromatin on a Young Drosophila Y chromosome	The transition from euchromatin to heterochromatin is a fundamental process that particularly reshaped the epigenomic landscape of Y chromosome. Its definitive genomic underpinning and broad functional impact are still unclear, as heterochromatin (e.g., that of human Y) is usually too repetitive to study. I have previously demonstrated that, the young Y (‘neo-Y’) chromosome of Drosophila miranda has just initiated such a transition, thus is a powerful model to unveil the evolution, regulation and functional interaction of heterochromatin. I showed that this neo-Y still harbours over 1800 genes, and only 20-50% of the sequences are transposable elements (TE). Over five years, I aim to: 1) precisely resolve the structure and insertion sites of TEs as a pre-requisite for studying heterochromatin, by combining state-of-art sequencing and bioinformatic techniques. 2) I will reveal the de novo heterochromatin formation triggered by TE insertions or the heterochromatin/euchromatin boundary shifts on the neo-Y, by comparing the binding profiles of histone modification hallmarks and insulator proteins of D. miranda to its sibling species D. pseudoobscura, which lacks the neo-Y. Such epigenomic changes have likely driven the exaptation or innovation of small RNA pathways that govern the TE mobility. 3) I will then identify the responsible small RNAs and their encoding loci, which are expected to have newly emerged or differentially expressed in D. miranda relative to D. pseudoobscura. 4) Finally, I will develop CRISPR/Cas9 in D. miranda to manipulate the expression of TEs encoding such small RNAs on the neo-Y, in order to scrutinize how TE/heterochromatin evolution on the Y would impact the chromatin landscape of the entire host genome. The combined aim of this multidisciplinary project is to generate a framework for understanding the basic mechanisms of how heterochromatin evolves; and open a new avenue toward the discovery of Y chromosome function beyond male determination.

The complex inheritance patterns underlying the majority of disease are poorly understood. I aim to discover the basis of this missing heritability to inform translational research. Genome-wide association studies suggest the majority of missing ALS heritability is distributed throughout non-coding DNA. Within these regions, established methods for identifying disease-associated coding variants are either ineffective or underpowered. I have developed pioneering methodology to detect ALS-associated genetic variation within gene-enhancers and promoters - non-coding DNA elements that control gene expression. Using whole genome sequencing (WGS) data I identified genome-wide significant ALS-associated variation in enhancers controlling expression of METTL8 (p=1.7E-06). Moreover, I used a non-linear model to identify new ALS-association within gene-promoters which was twice as effective as standard methodology. I will validate my discoveries using a high-throughput reporter; top candidates will be modelled in vitro and in vivo. I will develop my methodology to be cell-specific by profiling of epigenomic features within normal motor neurons.

Regulation of gene expression by DNA methylation (5mC) in response to genetic and environmental risk factors is considered important to human obesity and type-2 diabetes (T2D) pathogenesis. Yet, difficulty finding causal 5mC changes in humans is limiting downstream clinical applications. I have discovered 5mC changes robustly associated with obesity and their predicted effector genes in human adipocytes. I have then refined these loci and genes using human genomics, cross-species transcriptomics and biological evidence to 3 top candidates for discovery of novel mechanisms of disease – the MEDAG, FGFRL1 and TXNRD1 loci. I will use sophisticated gene targeting to investigate the causal effects of the MEDAG, FGFRL1 and TXNRD1 genes on obesity and T2D in a mouse model of human disease, and detailed phenotyping to examine the pathophysiological mechanisms. In parallel, I will use functional and experimental genomics to explore the regulatory significance of obesity-associated 5mC sites on MEDAG, FGFRL1 and TXNRD1 gene expression, and the underlying epigenetic mechanisms, in human adipocytes. These complementary lines of evidence will establish whether locus-specific 5mC variations and subsequent gene expression changes impact on human obesity phenotypes, and may define epigenomic and molecular targets for new obesity and T2D therapies.

For instance, somatic biallelic loss of CDK12, somatic/germline mutations in DNA-repair pathway, and their therapeutic vulnerability to poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase inhibitors is well-established in Caucasian PCa cohorts. However, mutational landscape of PCa patients from India and their clinical significance is largely unknown. To understand the disease-pathobiology and redefine therapeutic targets for these patients, here, we aim to explore the genomic aberrations prevalent in PCa patients from India. We will perform in-depth multi-platform comprehensive profiling (Whole-Exome Sequencing and RNA-Sequencing) of a discovery-cohort (n=50), and targeted gene-panel (~2000) approach for validation cohort, subsequently develop a focused ~200 gene-panel as a prototype for future clinical-testing. Moreover, we will also establish PCa patient-derived organoids (PDO) and PDO-xenografts for genomic characterization and potential drug-screening, which retains similar genetic-signatures and therapeutic-response as patients. Finally, we aim to develop tumor cell-free DNA/exosome-based diagnostics for detecting clinically-relevant androgen-receptor mutations and splice-variants, which predicts resistance to abiraterone and enzalutamide, and would assist in treatment selection of castration-resistant patients. The proposed study will provide the much-needed information of the contributing genetic/epigenetic events in Indian PCa cohort, and allow clinicians/urologists to re-visit the disease management-strategies.

Screening efficacy and toxicology of drug candidates in early stages of development has been recognized to be an essential part of drug screening. 90% of all Phase I drug candidates do not reach FDA approval and it is estimated that a quarter of failures relates to unexpected toxicity in humans. This is stunning given that all Phase I drugs have undergone animal-heavy battery of toxicologic tests and showcases the importance of expanding the screening capabilities for drug efficacy and toxicology in human cell-based assays, be it standard culture, organoids or engineered tissues. We believe that the interaction of drugs with the epigenome is an understudied/undervalued area of pre-clinical testing and epigenetic drug profiling will be key in predicting long term outcome in humans. With hmqChIP-Seq, 96 or more drug conditions can be screened against 24 or more epigenomic markers, such as histone or DNA post-translational modifications using specific antibodies and next-generation sequencing read-out. The method development aims to reduce the necessary input material to 1000 cells per condition, allowing it to be placed downstream of typical high-throughput cell-based drug screening assay in a variety of relevant human cell models, such as induced pluripotent stem cells, engineered tissues, organoids. The technology provides a framework for high-throughput, low cost, elucidation of short and long term action and toxicology of epigenetic drugs, or any drug candidate that could affect epigenetic markers.

Many current vaccines are“inactivated” or “subunit” vaccines composed of purified or recombinant pathogen components to which anadjuvant is often added to increase the magnitude of antibody responses. However, subunit vaccines formulatedwith current FDA-approved adjuvants do not sufficiently boost immunity in some populations, particularly immunocompromised and elderly subjects. Numerous adjuvants have been discovered in recent years and showenhanced immunogenicity as single agents; however, little is known about the activity of their combination, theirsafety, their efficacy and their mechanisms of action. Responses to vaccination and adjuvants involve dendriticcells (DCs), which capture and present vaccine antigens thereby facilitating the differentiation of follicular helperT cells (Tfh) and B cells and subsequent humoral immunity. Therefore, we propose to examine the molecularmechanisms and functional outputs of human DC subsets exposed to combination adjuvants ex vivo and in vivo.The focus on human DCs is essential given the substantial differences in innate immune receptor distributionand function between the mouse and the human. Our goal is to select a combination adjuvant using functional assays, followed by in-depth investigation of molecular pathways accounting for enhanced immunogenicity. Ourcollaboration with industry will enable the transition of the selected combination adjuvant to further studies of human vaccination. Our Specific Aims are built towards this goal. Thus, first we will screen adjuvant combinations by assessing the capacity of adjuvant-activated human DC subsets to skew the differentiation of naïve CD4+Tcells into Tfh cells that secrete IL-21 and induce B cells to produce IgG and IgA antibodies (Aim 1). Promising combinations will be further studied in DCs using validated, sensitive and high-throughput transcriptomic epigenomic, proteomic and metabolomic methods, and by functional knockdown in vitro, to determine theunderlying molecular pathways of adjuvant efficacy (Aim 2). We will then validate the identified molecularpathways through functional knockdown studies in vivo using humanized mice carrying a functionally reconstituted human immune system, which will also enable the examination of possible side effects (Aim 3). The proposed research program will leverage cutting-edge epigenetic (ATAC-seq), transcriptional, gene editing(CRISPR/Cas9) and metabolomic technologies; innovative humanized mouse models; a powerful computationaland bioinformatics infrastructure at The Jackson Laboratory; and the complementary expertise of a dynamicteam of investigators. Our deliverable is a combination adjuvant for enhanced humoral immunity and molecularpathways that are essential for its efficacy.	National Institutes of Health	Research Grant	141667.0	USD

Early studies are emerging, but it is still unclear what may determine better or worse outcomes for these patients and their caregivers, and what the long-term consequences that having this virus might be. COVID-19 leads to severe respiratory, cardiac, neurologic and kidney complications that may warrant hospital and ICU admission. Current data suggests that 80-85% of people infected with COVID-19 have mild symptoms and are not hospitalized. Of those who are hospitalized, 60-80% will be discharged from hospital after a few days, and 20-40% may require ICU care and mechanical ventilation (approximately 4-6% of all COVID-19 positive patients). The determining factors of these varied clinical paths are urgently needed and unknown. Our investigator group is proposing an Ontario COVID-19 Prospective Cohort Study (OnCovP). This will be a multi-centre, one-year follow-up of COVID-19 patients who are hospitalized in acute care hospitals in Ontario. Our overall objectives are to determine short- (in hospital) and longer-term (1, 3, 6 and 12 months post-acute hospital discharge) outcomes in patients and their caregivers, and the clinical, sociodemographic, genetic/ transcriptomic/epigenomic predictors of these outcomes. Our overall hypothesis is that clinical risk factors (including but not limited to age, baseline health, socio-demographic status, comorbid illness and candidate genetic/transcriptomic/epigenomic risk factors) are determinants of short- and long-term outcomes in patients with COVID-19. We will prospectively recruit 500 consecutive patients (>age 16) who are COVID-19+ and admitted to hospitals in Ontario through the GEMINI (general internal medicine) and RECOVER (critical care) networks of investigators, as well as their caregivers. By leveraging expertise from investigators across disciplines and divisions, we have constructed a suite of five complementary projects that explore the genetic, transcriptomic and epigenomic evaluation of COVID-19 infection across the illness and recovery trajectory during the acute illness and in the context of multidimensional long-term outcomes. We will access electronic data through the GEMINI network, and explore AI analyses and linkages to ICES data. This project will contribute new knowledge to outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infections and will inform large-scale public health planning, clinical care, and ongoing resource needs.

Boks	Universitair Medisch Centrum Utrecht	Rudolf Magnus Instituut	2018-04-01	2021-03-31	How nutrition shapes brain development: Brain organoids as replacement for animal studies	Healthy brain development is critical for human behaviour and cognition, and deviations from such normal development increase the risk for a range of neurological and psychiatric conditions across the life span. Even though it is now clear that the brain is most vulnerable to nutrition, during early gestation, the mechanisms how early life nutrition has lifelong consequences is largely unknown. A recent discovery shows that the modification of activity of the mTOR pathway by diet has important consequences for neurodevelopment. In this proposal we aim to understand the impact of nutritional modification of mTOR activity on neuronal development and investigate its epigenomic basis. Capitalising on the full potential of in vitro neuronal models including brain organoids we aim to examine immediate readouts of neuronal development as well as epigenetic alterations that underlie nutrition related changes in brain function. We hypothesize that distinct epigenetic changes underlie the effects of nutrition on morphological and functional changes in neurons during early brain development.

Anti-tumour immunity is highly heterogeneous within tumours and intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) is a major driver for treatment resistance. The functional basis of intra-tumour immune heterogeneity (ITIH) is largely unknown, in part because we lack appropriate pre-clinical and functional models. Here, I aim to identify the impact of ITH on anti-tumour immunity. I have recently developed an organoid – T-cell co-culture system that I will use to generate personalised models of ITIH. Using this expertise, and leveraging the TRACERx cancer evolution clinical study, I will generate high-resolution functional models by establishing multiple clonal organoid lines in parallel – from the same tumour – from multi-region biopsies of NSCLC. Sensitivity to T-cell pressure will be evaluated by co-culturing organoids with autologous T-cells. Individual organoid sublines will then be characterised to identify genetic, transcriptomic, or epigenomic factors underlying differential immune sensitivity. Candidate genes are functionally validated using CRISPR-Cas9. By combining functional models with the detailed evolutionary analysis of TRACERx, ITIH can be studied at unprecedented resolution. Identifying the drivers of ITIH could potentially extend the success of immunotherapy to thousands of NSCLC patients.	ZonMw	Strategic research	None	None

While antibiotic therapy and intensive care treatments have led to decreases in sepsis mortality, high mortality rates up to 20-40% depending of the infecting microorganism have remained unchanged in the last decade. It is therefore believed that antimicrobial and intensive care therapy alone will not further improve the poor outcome of patients with sepsis, and a complementary immunotherapeutic approach to tackle host defense disturbances is urgently needed. The rationale for immunosuppressive therapy in sepsis was based on the beneficial effects of cytokine inhibition in animal models of sepsis. However, this approach of targeting inhibition of proinflammatory mediators has been proven unsuccessful in many clinical trials during the last twenty years. The most likely explanation for this is that the majority of septic patients do not die due to complications resulting from an overwhelming proinflammatory immune response, but rather due to secondary/opportunistic infections resulting from a severely suppressed immune response in the later phases of sepsis, also termed immunoparalysis or tolerance. A significant component of sepsis-associated tolerance is attributable to functional reprogramming of innate immune cells that can lead to decreased responses to future infection. In the context of the BLUEPRINT (EU FP7) project, we performed extensive epigenomic and transcriptomic characterization of in vitro LPS-induced macrophage tolerization. We identified several molecular pathways that are disrupted in LPS exposed monocytes, leading to aberrant epigenetic profiles in tolerant macrophages. These epigenetic profiles were associated with genes involved in cytokine release and phagocytosis, providing an explanation for the inability of tolerized macrophages to release cytokines at LPS re-exposure. Our preliminary epigenomic analysis identified several potential targets for reversal of tolerance in macrophages. The main objective of the proposed project is to develop novel approaches to epigenetically reprogram and re-activate the defective function of tolerized human monocytes ex vivo, and to characterize the epigenetic mechanisms involved both in in vitro and in vivo induced tolerance. We hypothesize that induction of tolerance in monocytes both in vitro and in vivo (LPS-trials or in sepsis patients) involves common, epigenetic circuits that can be blocked or reversed to lead to differentiation towards healthy immunologically-responsive macrophages. In order to complete this project, we will use a combination of in vitro experiments on monocytes from healthy donors and in vivo experiments on monocytes from sepsis patients and an endotoxemia model (healthy volunteers injected with LPS). The epigenomes of in vitro induced and in vivo (sepsis/clinical trial) induced tolerized monocytes and macrophages will be compared, and common molecular pathways will be targeted for reversal of tolerance. Reversal of tolerance will be performed ex vivo on in vivo-induced tolerized monocytes from sepsis patients and LPS clinical trials. All promising treatments will be interrogated further using epigenomic and transciptomic techniques to determine the mode of action at the molecular level. The findings of current proposal are expected to be of great value for both understanding the basic mechanisms of host defense and for translation to novel therapeutic approaches.

Early detection of cancer type and stage is crucial to predict disease outcome and treatment strategy. Cancer development and progression is associated with, and/or directed by extensive epigenomic changes including changes in DNA methylation. The goal of this Hotel project is to interrogate the epigenome of HPV induced cervical cancers and a precursor stage using the novel MeD-seq technology. Regions with differential methylation will be related to cancer progression and analyzed to identify reliable and robust DNA methylation markers. PCR based assays will be developed and validated as new high throughput diagnostic assays with a high sensitivity and specificity.	ZonMw	Development project	None	None

Liu	Nederlands Kanker Instituut	None	2017-09-01	2020-08-31	Impact of sequential driver mutations on epigenetic regulation during intestinal carcinogensis	Transcriptional alterations caused by sporadic mutations is one of the key forces driving colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. To date, the impact of sequential CRC driver mutations on epigenetic regulation, which is important to our understanding of intestinal carcinogenesis, remains largely unknown. Clinical tissues or cell lines represent only single mutagenic stages, which hinders direct comparison between different mutagenic stages in the same donors. Also, co-occurred passenger mutations in these models introduce confounding effects for the investigation. Fortunately, CRISPR-Cas9 and organoid culture technologies can rapidly generate isogenic models with desirable driver mutations and no/few passenger mutations. With my experience in genome editing and next-generation sequencing, I plan to profile the epigenome and transcriptome of genetically modified intestinal organoids to study epigenetic dynamics during intestinal carcinogenesis. Core hypothesis: Sequential driver mutations result in a unique epigenomic landscape at each mutagenic stage, and consequently drive CRC progression. Key steps and novelties: 1. Epigenome and transcriptome of mutagenic organoids: Somatic mutations in 4 genes (APC/KRAS/SMAD4/TP53) are considered as the major drivers for CRC. I propose to introduce these mutations into normal intestinal organoids from two different donors in two sequential orders (A-K-S-P and K-A-S-P) using CRISPR-Cas9, and subsequently apply ATAC-seq, H3K27ac ChIP-seq and RNA-seq to study stepwise epigenetic and transcriptomic changes during CRC progression and impact of the mutagenic order on the epigenetic landscape. 2. Molecular landmarks during mutagenic transformation: Profiles generated in Step 1 will be used to identify dynamic chromatin regions, potential transcription factor (TF) interactors, and gene targets. 3. Functional validation of epigenetic regulators: The top candidate regulators, e.g. regulatory regions and TF interactors, will be validated using CRISPR-Cas9 and phenotypical assays. I aim to explore how driver mutations affect epigenetic regulation and consequently disease phenotype. The resulted knowledge is important for depending novel prognostic markers and therapeutic targets.	Dutch Research Council (NWO)	Veni	250000.0	EUR

Transcription factors (TFs) bind to cis-regulatory elements and control lineage specification by combinatorial action. Understanding the complex cis-regulatory grammar that underlies cell fate choice is of great importance for stem cell research and regenerative medicine. However, due to the inherent complexity of GRNs, our understanding of how they shape complex phenotypes remains incomplete. The objective of this application is to determine conserved gene regulatory modules in early metazoan development using genome-wide GRN inference based on accurately annotated genomes. To model GRNs genome-wide in different species, accurate genomic annotation of regulatory elements is essential. First, I will integrate epigenomic and transcriptomic data for accurate annotation of gene models and regulatory elements. Second, I will develop deep learning models for genomic annotation. These will be applied to annotate new genomes using unsupervised transfer learning, incorporating the wealth of existing annotation in model species. Finally, I will use developmental time-course data from a large number of animals to compare the gene regulatory networks during early metazoan development and determine conserved regulatory modules. All computational methods that I develop will be implemented in robust and open source scientific software. In summary, I will combine state-of-the-art computational algorithms and large data sets with an evolutionary developmental biology approach. By comparing development between species, we can essentially view gene regulatory networks through an evolutionary lens. This will yield insight into the rules by which regulatory elements define cell identity and behavior. Ultimately, this knowledge can guide directed (trans)differentiation of clinically relevant cell types for disease modeling and regenerative medicine. Better models of gene regulation will help to understand the basic processes of development and differentiation and will thereby have a tangible impact on human health.

Zhou	RUN Fac Natuur Wisk en Inf	None	2018-12-01	2020-08-31	A matter of identity: master regulator p63-orchestrated transcription factor circuitry in the epithelial cell fate determination of normal development and disease	The determination of cell identity is an important process for normal development and diseases. Key transcription factors (TFs) regulating cell fate-determining genes are crucial in this process. The aim of this project is to identify key TFs and their regulatory circuitry that determine epithelial cell fates, specifically of epidermal and corneal limbal cells. The TF p63 is a key regulator of development and diseases of the epidermis and the cornea. Its proper expression and function are essential but not sufficient for the identity of these epithelial cells. We will therefore use p63 as the anchor and identify the p63-orchestrated TF circuitry and hierarchy for the epidermal and limbal cell fate determination, and their relevance to development and disease. We will use unique human cellular models from control individuals and patients carrying p63 mutations, and: I. Identify key TFs for the epidermal and limbal cell fate determination and those that are de-regulated by p63 mutations, using a combination of epigenomic and proteomic approaches. II. Predict cell fate initiating TFs, associated TFs and their hierarchy, by integrating high-throughput functional datasets using gene regulatory network approaches and predictive computational models. III. Functionally characterize key TFs and their hierarchy in trans-differentiation and 3D organotypic models. This frontier research is expected to uncover the functionally validated p63-orchestrated TF circuitry for the epithelial cell determination and its relevance to disease. The identified TF circuitry and trans-differentiation methods will also open new possibilities for understanding related diseases and developing strategies in regenerative medicine.
