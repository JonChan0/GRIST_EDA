10	Professor Murphy Chris	University of Oxford	2015-09-01	2017-08-31	Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to identify therapeutic targets of microRNAs	MicroRNAs show great therapeutic promise and clinical trials are underway to treat a variety of human diseases. However, since a single microRNA can (and does) target multiple genes, for both efficacy and safety concerns there is a clear need to identify and selectively affect only the relevant (beneficial) target sites. No current approaches can do this and we will address this unmet need through the use of state-of-the-art genome editing technologies. To this end we have developed a very potent strategy using CRISPR/Cas9 mediated homology-directed repair for the assessment of microRNA response element (MRE) activity in human cells. In the current study such an approach will be applied to human chondrocytes to enable identification of endogenously active microRNA binding sites in phenotypically important genes. We believe these MREs, rather than the microRNAs themselves, to be the most appropriate targets for future clinical trials.	Versus Arthritis	Project Grant	220825.07GBP

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 90 loci that are associated with T2D risk and most of the identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affect Î²-cell mass or function. A limitation of the above approaches is that they highlight broad regions in the genome (loci), and usually implicate multiple genes as affecting disease risk. Functional studies in model systems are ultimately required to determine which genes are chiefly responsible. The proposed project will take advantage of primary human islets and knockout mouse models and will analyse the impact on insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis respectively of the inactivation of genes close to two adjacent SNPs, rs4502156 and rs11071657, namely VPS13C, C2CD4A, C2CD4B. We have already generated mice null for the murine homologue of VPS13C selectively in Î²-cells, and will shortly receive animals deleted globally for C2cd4a and C2cd4b using CRISPR/Cas9 technologies through the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC). Subject to progress, studies will also be extended to the role of the PTPLB gene at the ADCY5 locus.

Vertebrate size is established based on total cell number generated during development. Despite the 75 million-fold difference in size between the smallest and largest mammals, the mechanisms for this remain to be determined. This proposal seeks insight into how total cell number is determined in both pathological and physiological states. Over the last decade our study of extreme growth disorders has identified 18 new human disease genes. We established these encode core components of the cell-cycle machinery, providing cellular and developmental insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of these disorders. From our starting point of human disease, this approach also revealed novel genome instability genes informing fundamental research of basic biological processes. Still, the molecular basis for over half of individuals with microcephalic dwarfism remains unknown. This proposal will break new ground through the comprehensive application of Whole Genome Sequencing to our patient cohort to achieve screen saturation via identification of coding and non-coding mutations. Forward-genetic genome-wide CRISPR screens in developmentally relevant cell and organoid systems will also be developed to define key cellular processes impacting human growth. Beyond these âdiscovery scienceâ approaches, cellular and model organism techniques will be used to define the mechanistic basis for human disease caused by mutations in core replication machinery and key epigenetic factors. To extend prior work on pathophysiological mechanisms, we aim to establish a subset of microcephalic dwarfism genes as growth regulators, and thereby further define when and how organism size is determined. These studies will link essential cellular machinery governing proliferation with human disease, identify novel genome-stability factors and may yield insights into the developmental regulation of mammalian size.

Yet, on average only 37 new drugs are launched annually before undergoing risk-benefit analysis. Those posing health risks receive âadverse drugs reaction (ADR) notificationsâ or âblack box warningsâ. When Seldane was âblack boxedâ, sales decreased by Â£200M. Withdrawal from market occurs in severe cases; 462 drugs were discontinued between 1953-2013 (=$396-650Bn), with unexpected cardio-toxicity the leading cause. Better methods and models are needed to validate potential drugs prior to animal testing, thereby minimising animal welfare, financial and patient safety issues. Our recent publications (2018) describe NC3Rsfunded work on the use of precision genetic engineering to develop stem cell models of genetic heart disease, specifically the prevalent and life-threatening condition of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Often ADRs or black box warnings arise because drugs interfere with each other or are complicated by underlying health issues. Of the top 200 drugs, 81 carry black box warnings and 82 carry ADRs for the cardiovascular system. Working with the Medicines Discovery Catapult, we will determine whether stem cell-derived heart cells can predict drug safety/toxicity, and whether this profile changes in healthy or diseased context. Successful project delivery would allow further funding to be sourced to progress the technology as a tool to assist routine cardiotoxicity profiling, ADR or black box labelling. A 10% reduction in animal use would save ~35,000 animals, money and patient lives.

Our recent publications (2018) describe NC3Rsfunded work on the use of precision genetic engineering to develop stem cell models of genetic heart disease, specifically the prevalent and life-threatening condition of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Often ADRs or black box warnings arise because drugs interfere with each other or are complicated by underlying health issues. Of the top 200 drugs, 81 carry black box warnings and 82 carry ADRs for the cardiovascular system. Working with the Medicines Discovery Catapult, we will determine whether stem cell-derived heart cells can predict drug safety/toxicity, and whether this profile changes in healthy or diseased context.

41	Dr Carroll Jason	University of Cambridge	2015-06-01	2020-05-31	Estrogen Receptor activity in breast cancer.	Background:Estrogen Receptor (ER) is the driving transcription factor in ~75% of all breast cancers. It is also the target of endocrine therapies, but drug resistance is a common clinical problem. The progesterone receptor (PR) and androgen receptor (AR) pathways are active in ER+ cells, but the putative cross-talk that exists with ER is unclear. ER is dependent on pioneer factors such as FoxA1 and GATA3 for activity and both of these factors were recently shown to be mutated in breast cancer. Aims:We will characterise the functional interplay between ER, progesterone receptor (PR) and androgen receptor (AR), with the goal of characterising how PR and AR influence ER activity and whether there is potential competition or co-operation between PR and AR pathways in modulating ER activity. We will identify post-translational modifications on FoxA1 and GATA3 and identify upstream regulatory enzymes that influence the activity of these two important factors, with the goal of identifying druggable targets (i.e. regulatory kinases) that could be exploited for targeting of FoxA1 or GATA3. As a parallel aim, we will engineer in the recently observed mutations that occur in ER, GATA3 and FoxA1, to assess the impact on ER function and the cross-talk that exists between ER, PR and AR. A novel method will be developed in order to characterise PR and AR isoforms that might be involved in ER regulation.Methods:We will assess the impact of activation of PR and/or AR pathways on ER activity by assessing transcription factor-DNA interactions (ChIP-seq), gene expression events (RNA-seq) and growth differences. This will be explored in a physiologically relevant explant system. Mutant GATA3 and FoxA1 expressing cell lines will be generated using CRISPR-Cas9 or ZFN technologies and characterised. Upstream regulators of GATA3 and FoxA1 will be discovered using CRISPR or siRNA screens. A novel chromatin pull-down approach will be developed, based on modifications of the ChIP-exonuclease mapping method.The results will define the variables that influence treatment responses from existing antiestrogen therapies. In addition, it will provide the rationale for using existing hormonal agents for the treatment of endocrine resistant cancer, in novel combinations. Furthermore, it will identify new therapeutic targets and provide the biological justification for the use of new treatment strategies in endocrine resistant patients.

This modification is removed by a single enzyme, OGlcNAc hydrolase (OGA). Both proteins are essential for mammalian embryonic and perinatal survival, respectively. Recently, mutations in OGT have been identified as causal in intellectual disability (ID), however, the exact mechanism leading to this disorder are unknown. This studentship will endeavour to identify how two hypothesised mechanisms contribute to OGT-ID: altered O-GlcNAcylation and altered OGT:protein interactions. To achieve this the student will use Drosophila melanogaster as a model system. OGT is highly conserved from humans to Drosophila, along with many of its interactors, such as the mitochondrial motility protein Milton and periodicity proteins involved in the circadian rhythm. The student will dissect the molecular mechanisms leading to ID through achieving 4 aims. (1) The student will generate fly lines carrying OGT mutations equivalent to those found in patients using a CRISPR/Cas9 system. We have already demonstrated the viability of this approach successfully generating a fly line carrying a patient mutation. (2) These fly lines will then be assayed for a number of neuronal phenotypes, both morphological and behavioural. The former will be achieved using a combination of genetic and antibody labelling to visualize gross brain morphology, mushroom body morphology (the associative memory region of the fly brain, and an excellent model to study axonal morphology), and dendritic morphology using class IV dendritic arborisation sensory neurons. To assay neuronal function through behaviour, a light-off habituation test will be employed. This leverages the natural escape response of Drosophila to a sudden reduction in light, in nature signalling the presence of a predator, and measures their neuronal adaptation to the repetition of this stimulus without the ordinarily associated consequence. In preliminary experiments, we have found a decrease in habituation in OGT mutant flies. (3) The specific mechanisms driving the observed phenotypes will be dissected through proteomic and transcriptomic approaches. Quantitative O-GlcNAc proteomics will be conducted through enrichment of O-GlcNAcylated proteins with a catalytically inactive OGA we have used for this purpose in the past. The role of individual proteins or modified sites will be probed through genetic approaches, ablating induvial proteins to assess genetic interactions or individual modified sites by mutating modified residues to alanine. An additional approach which can be employed is the mutation of identified sites to cysteine. We have found this results in a SGlcNAc modification which is not hydrolysable by OGA, elevating the stoichiometry of the modification on a single residue. This is a technique which has never before been employed in vivo, and we would assay in the context of rescuing (some of) the phenotypes seen in OGT mutant flies. (4) The student will also attempt to rescue observed phenotypes by globally manipulating O-GlcNAc levels, genetically by knocking out OGA (which unlike in mammals is tolerated in the fly) and pharmacologically through the use of OGA inhibitors or glucosamine supplementation. All aforementioned approaches have been shown to result in elevated OGlcNAcylation. Their efficacy at rescuing phenotypes will be assayed through administration at various developmental stages providing insight into the reversibility of the ID in adult organisms. Together, this studentship will answer many fundamental questions about the role of OGT mutations in the development of ID, establish Drosophila as a model for the functional analysis of single site O-GlcNAc modifications, and guide future research we will conduct on a mammalian system.

46	Dr Pollard Steven	University of Edinburgh	2014-08-01	2015-07-31	Equipment supplement: The role of SOX and FOX genes in orchestrating transcriptional and epigenetic programs in glioblastoma	Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most devastating human cancers. There are few treatment options and median survival is only around one year. Sequence-specific transcription factors required for normal neural stem cell self-renewal are likely to play critical roles in driving unconstrained self-renewal in GBM. Particularly interesting are members of the forkhead box (FOX) and SRY-related (SOX) families, which orchestrate lineage choice, differentiation and proliferation/survival pathways in the developing nervous system. For example, there is clear evidence that FOXG1 and SOX2 cooperate to establish and sustain the neural stem cell state. Although each of these factors has been previously implicated in human GBM, we have poor mechanistic understanding of their specific functions and key downstream effectors. Aims: We will define the specific function, molecular partners and transcriptional targets of FOXG1 and SOX2 in normal human neural stem (NS) cells and GBM-derived neural stem (GNS) cells. Our hypothesis is that in GBM the increased level and/or activity of these factors restricts differentiation, locking cells into a continuous cycle of self-renewal. There are three complementary aims: 1) Test the role of SOX and FOX in establishing and sustaining GBM. 2) Determine the molecular basis of SOX2 and FOXG1 activity by defining their molecular partners and key transcriptional targets. 3) Exploit our expertise in genome editing to explore FOX and SOX gene function and create live cell reporters for drug screening. Methods: We will use primary human GBM-derived cell lines as a tractable and disease-relevant model. We have routine access to fresh tumours and a set of well-characterized GNS cell lines. Intracranial transplantation will be used to assess the malignancy of cells following perturbation of FOXG1 and SOX2. Tumour initiation will be tested by delivery of lentiviral overexpression vectors into the mouse forebrain. ChIP-seq, and immunoprecipitation mass spectometry (IP-MS) will be used to determine targets and partners, respectively. Genome editing methods (TALENs and/or CRISPR/Cas system) will be exploited to generate conditional alleles and knock-in reporters. How the results will be used: SOX2 and FOXG1 proteins are important therapeutic targets, yet we need to define their precise molecular activities to identify âdruggableâ effectors. These might be direct protein partners within the transcriptional/chromatin regulatory complex, or downstream transcriptional targets. The SOX2 and FOXG1 reporter cell lines developed in this project will be of immense value for cell based screening for new drug discovery.	Cancer Research UK	TCDB - Personal Award	3226648.0GBP

Aims: We will define the specific function, molecular partners and transcriptional targets of FOXG1 and SOX2 in normal human neural stem (NS) cells and GBM-derived neural stem (GNS) cells. Our hypothesis is that in GBM the increased level and/or activity of these factors restricts differentiation, locking cells into a continuous cycle of self-renewal. There are three complementary aims: 1) Test the role of SOX and FOX in establishing and sustaining GBM. 2) Determine the molecular basis of SOX2 and FOXG1 activity by defining their molecular partners and key transcriptional targets. 3) Exploit our expertise in genome editing to explore FOX and SOX gene function and create live cell reporters for drug screening. Methods: We will use primary human GBM-derived cell lines as a tractable and disease-relevant model. We have routine access to fresh tumours and a set of well-characterized GNS cell lines. Intracranial transplantation will be used to assess the malignancy of cells following perturbation of FOXG1 and SOX2. Tumour initiation will be tested by delivery of lentiviral overexpression vectors into the mouse forebrain. ChIP-seq, and immunoprecipitation mass spectometry (IP-MS) will be used to determine targets and partners, respectively. Genome editing methods (TALENs and/or CRISPR/Cas system) will be exploited to generate conditional alleles and knock-in reporters. How the results will be used: SOX2 and FOXG1 proteins are important therapeutic targets, yet we need to define their precise molecular activities to identify âdruggableâ effectors. These might be direct protein partners within the transcriptional/chromatin regulatory complex, or downstream transcriptional targets. The SOX2 and FOXG1 reporter cell lines developed in this project will be of immense value for cell based screening for new drug discovery.	Medical Research Council	Unit	1439000.0GBP

58	Prof Miska Eric	University of Cambridge	2015-04-01	2018-03-31	Non-coding RNA and cancer: new mechanisms and therapeutic opportunities	The human genome is massively transcribed (70%), mostly into non-coding RNA. Specific classes of non-coding RNA have emerged as key regulators of gene expression. For example, microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of human disease gene that is key to cancer. Specifically, some miRNAs regulate cancer therapeutic targets acting as tumour suppressors or oncogenes. Some miRNAs are prognostic and diagnostic markers of cancer. Recently, a number of additional classes of non-coding RNA have emerged, e.g. Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Using our expertise in RNA molecular biology and genomics we will continue to determine how non-coding RNAs interface with cancer biology. In addition, we will develop new strategies for anti-cancer therapies. We will continue to use the powerful molecular genetic tools available in the laboratory model organism C. elegans. However, over the next five years we will take full advantage of recent advances in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS) and organoid culture technology alongside Cas9/CRISPR genome editing to translate our work to humans. We know that âsimpleâ Mendelian disorders can be caused by a wide variety of genetic variants, from single nucleotide mutations to short insertions and deletions to larger structural variants. A number of such genetic variants are caused by the mobilization of genomic elements such as retrotransposons in the germline. However most research into complex disease such as cancer has focused on using genetic association methods on single nucleotide polymorphisms in conserved single copy regions of the genome. This overlooks fast evolving parts of the human genome, representing perhaps 50% of the total sequence. Our focus will be to investigate how piRNAs contribute to the epigenetic control of mobile elements, which in turn regulates their mobility. Epigenetic deregulation of mobile elements in the soma might also contribute to human disease including cancer. Over the last twenty years RNA interference (RNAi) has been explored as a novel drug platform, e.g. in cancer, but RNA delivery remains a hard problem. We will investigate recent advances in our understanding of naturally mobile (extracellular) non-coding RNA with respect to cancer therapy. We will characterize RNA-modifying enzymes for drug discovery. There are 65 distinct modifications of RNA known in eukaryotes. We will characterize RNA-modifying enzymes that are known to regulate cancer-related miRNAs and lncRNAs. Small molecule inhibitors of such enzymes might allow us to target non-coding RNA pathways using classical chemistry as a novel anti-cancer therapy.

Moreover, we have discovered that this pathway affects the Chk1 inhibitor sensitivity of cancer cells undergoing replication stress, providing insights into patient stratification and potential resistance mechanisms for their clinical use. This programme of research will define NF-kappaBâs role in oncogene induced DNA replication stress. This will generate new insights and hypotheses that will be tested in vivo using mouse models and integrated with the work of drug discovery teams and clinicians. Specific Aims: we will determine: (1) The role of RelA T505 phosphorylation in mouse models of oncogene driven cancer. We will define the shared mechanisms and generality of the pathways controlled by Chk1 mediated phosphorylation of the RelA NF-kappaB subunit at T505 in the context of oncogene-driven tumorigenesis. (2) The importance of the NF-kappaB target gene Claspin as a regulator of tumorigenesis. We will exploit tumour associated Claspin mutations to determine its role as a regulator of Chk1 inhibitor resistance and tumour development in vivo. We will analyse mutations in Claspin and other genes associated with the Chk1 pathway that arise during the Phase 1 clinical trial of the CCT245737 Chk1 inhibitor. (3) How DNA replication stress regulates NF-kappaB activity in vivo. We will define how the NF-kappaB subunits RelA and c-Rel are regulated by the ATR/Chk1 kinases during oncogene induced replication stress. (4) NF-kappaB regulation of the cellular response to oncogene induced DNA replication stress. We will determine the roles of RelA and c-Rel in MYC-induced B-cell lymphoma, leading to new hypotheses that will be tested in mouse models and human cell lines. Methods: We will take a unique approach that combines existing and new mouse models, together with RNASeq, ChIP-Seq and proteomics to determine for the first time the pathways regulating NF-kappaB function during oncogene induced DNA replication stress in vivo.

A infection initiates with the dissemination of the fast-replicating tachyzoites. At the onset of the immune response tachyzoites convert into slow-growing bradyzoites that form cysts in the central nervous system and in striated and heart muscles. Encystation ensures life-long persistence and poses a significant threat of reactivation during immunosuppression and can lead to encephalitis and severe clinical manifestations. Despite the importance of encystation for pathogenesis and transmission, our insight into how T. gondii defies the immune responses to take up permanent residence in the immunocompetent hosts is rudimentary. We propose to determine the molecular mechanisms governing cyst wall formation and parasite adaption to encystation. We will capitalize on the increased sensitivity of -omics approaches, the power of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, the high-resolution microscopy, and on the ex-vivo tissue examination by MALDI imaging mass spectrometry and NanoSIMS technologies.The specific objectives are to: 1. Identify the components of the Cyst Wall (CW), Parasitophorous Vacuole (PV) and PMV Membrane (PVM) of the cyst 2. Determine the parasite factors responsible for CW formation and maturation via targeted and unbiased approaches 3. Define the metabolic network of parasite that is able to initiate encystation and ensure persistence 4. Measure subversion of host metabolic functions by parasite effectors during encystation and persistence We anticipate fundamental discoveries on i) the regulatory and trafficking circuits that govern CW formation as a biological barrier during encystation ii) metabolic adaptation and subversion of host cellular functions during encystation. Ultimately, understanding parasite strategies and versatilities that ensures its parasitism in immunocompetent hosts and bottlenecks as new targets for intervention.

Despite the global impact of helminthiasis, lack of access to tractable experimental systems is severely hampering research progress. FUGI will advance this agenda by developing reverse genetics, genome-editing tools and immortal cell lines built around the thorough characterisation and understanding of parasitic flatworm stem cell systems. Application of CRISPR/Cas9 methods for facilitating flatworm genome-editing will grant unprecedented control over individual gene-level investigations. Use o f this technology to derive lines of knockout/knock-in flatworms will be assisted by our experience in harnessing retroviruses as germ-line, gene-transduction agents. Creation of immortalised flatworm cell lines, based on the proliferative potential of stem cell systems, will allow lifecycle-free, NC3R compliant, helminthology to proceed at pace. By applying tools of human stem cell science to parasitic flatworms, we will produce self-renewable resources for obtaining biological material, for o ptimising genome-editing tools and for generating homologous proteins suitable for functional investigations. FUGI will produce enabling resources (stored in community-accessible repositories) that will provide our field, for the first time, with the means to characterise the gene products responsible for parasite pathogenesis and persistence. These functional genomics tools will allow the helminth community to ask fundamental questions necessary to accelerate the development of novel anthelmint hic drugs and vaccines.

One of the key cellular mechanisms of regulating the activity of many proteins on a posttranslational timescale is through protein degradation using the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Specificity of proteolysis for any particular substrate is determined by its association with a specific E3-receptor subunit. F-box proteins are the substrate-recognition components of the E3- ubiquitin ligases. The human and mouse genome comprises 70-75 F-box proteins that are incompletely studied. The analysis of gene function in vivo is not always possible due to the lethality of knockout mouse. The experimental plan will use previously developed in vitro 3D organoid cultures to study the functions of E3s. Lentiviral gene overexpression and CRISPR/Cas genome editing will be used to modify genes in organoids. We aim; 1) to develop a new fluorescent/luminescent-based screening for knockout organoids in combination with the CRISPR/Cas system. We will apply this method to analyse loss-of-function phenotype of FBXW7-E3 enriched in intestinal stem cells. 2) We will establish large scale CRISPR/Cas-mediated mutagenesis in organoid cultures by a gRNA-expressing organoid library targeting F-box-type E3-ligases. Site-specific mutagenesis in organoids will be generated by inducible Cas9 recombinase. For an example, we will these organoids to screen E3s essential for growth, proliferation and differentiation. gRNAs in mutant clones will be sequenced and the gene responsible for the phenotype will be identified. The main objectives are: i) to establish CRISPR/Cas and fluorescent/luminescent screening system for functional genetic tools in organoid cultures ii) to understand the role of F-box-type E3-ligases. This study will provide useful genetic tools for organoid cultures and will demonstrate the efficacy of in vitro system to study gene functions. Mouse geneticists will be encouraged to use organoid cultures as the replacement for in vivo studies.

69	Univ.Prof. Dr. Busslinger Meinrad Josef	Research Insitute of Molecular Pathology	2018-01-01	2020-12-31	Multifunctional Role of the PAX5-JAK2 Oncoprotein in B Cell Leukemia	B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is the most common malignancy in children and also occurs in adolescents and adults. Despite good prognosis in pediatric patient outcome, at least 15% of patients will suffer from relapse. Hence, a deep understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of this disease is needed to improve current therapeutic approaches. For instance, genome-wide analyses of genetic alterations in B cell leukemia identified the transcription factor PAX5 as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor in one third of all B-ALL cases. Less is known about the role of PAX5 translocations and rearrangements, which generate novel chimeric PAX5 transcription factors in a smaller subset of B-ALL. The PAX5-JAK2 rearrangement creates a fusion protein that consists of the N- terminal DNA-binding paired domain of PAX5 linked to the C-terminal kinase domain of JAK2. The PAX5-JAK2 rearrangement is likely a dual-hit mutation as it inactivates one PAX5 allele and leads to the expression of a constitutively active JAK2 kinase that could activate the JAK- STAT signaling pathway. Moreover, JAK2 can act as an epigenetic regulator by phosphorylating tyrosine 41 on histone H3 (H3Y41ph), which functions as an active histone mark to stimulate gene expression. To investigate the role of PAX5-JAK2 in leukemia development, we have generated a mouse model expressing the PAX5-JAK2 protein from the endogenous Pax5 locus. Pax5JAK2/+ mice rapidly develop an aggressive B-ALL tumor without the need of an additional cooperating mutation, which thus confirms the dual-hit hypothesis. Having established a mouse tumor model for PAX5-JAK2, we will investigate to what degree PAX5-JAK2 contributes to B- ALL development through activation of canonical JAK-STAT signaling and/or the non-canonical epigenetic pathway. We will identify and characterize PAX5-JAK2-regulated target genes by genome-wide transcriptome, PAX5-JAK2 binding and chromatin profiling analyses of Pax5JAK2/+ B-ALL tumors. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutagenesis will then be used to define the functional relevance of the top-ranked target genes for leukemia development. By analyzing the expression profile of human PAX5-JAK2+ B-ALLs, we will determine the degree to which the critical PAX5-JAK2 target genes identified in mouse Pax5JAK2/+ B-ALL tumors are also deregulated in the human disease. Collectively, these data will provide novel important insight into the molecular mechanisms, by which the oncoprotein PAX5-JAK2 induces B cell leukemia, and may suggest improved therapeutic approaches for the treatment of this B-ALL subtype.

Background:Estrogen Receptor (ER) is the driving transcription factor in ~75% of all breast cancers. It is also the target of endocrine therapies, but drug resistance is a common clinical problem. The progesterone receptor (PR) and androgen receptor (AR) pathways are active in ER+ cells, but the putative cross-talk that exists with ER is unclear. ER is dependent on pioneer factors such as FoxA1 and GATA3 for activity and both of these factors were recently shown to be mutated in breast cancer. Aims:We will characterise the functional interplay between ER, progesterone receptor (PR) and androgen receptor (AR), with the goal of characterising how PR and AR influence ER activity and whether there is potential competition or co-operation between PR and AR pathways in modulating ER activity. We will identify post-translational modifications on FoxA1 and GATA3 and identify upstream regulatory enzymes that influence the activity of these two important factors, with the goal of identifying druggable targets (i.e. regulatory kinases) that could be exploited for targeting of FoxA1 or GATA3. As a parallel aim, we will engineer in the recently observed mutations that occur in ER, GATA3 and FoxA1, to assess the impact on ER function and the cross-talk that exists between ER, PR and AR. A novel method will be developed in order to characterise PR and AR isoforms that might be involved in ER regulation.Methods:We will assess the impact of activation of PR and/or AR pathways on ER activity by assessing transcription factor-DNA interactions (ChIP-seq), gene expression events (RNA-seq) and growth differences. This will be explored in a physiologically relevant explant system. Mutant GATA3 and FoxA1 expressing cell lines will be generated using CRISPR-Cas9 or ZFN technologies and characterised. Upstream regulators of GATA3 and FoxA1 will be discovered using CRISPR or siRNA screens. A novel chromatin pull-down approach will be developed, based on modifications of the ChIP-exonuclease mapping method.The results will define the variables that influence treatment responses from existing antiestrogen therapies. In addition, it will provide the rationale for using existing hormonal agents for the treatment of endocrine resistant cancer, in novel combinations. Furthermore, it will identify new therapeutic targets and provide the biological justification for the use of new treatment strategies in endocrine resistant patients.

Chronic inflammation has been shown, both experimentally and epidemiologically, to be a predisposition to, and also an inseparable aspect of clinically prevalent cancer entities. Therefore, a detailed understanding of both tumour and immune cell functions in cancer progression is a prerequisite for more successful therapeutic startegies. My team was the first to reveal the lymphocyte-intrinsic PKC/NR2F6 axis as an essential signalling node at the crossroads between inflammation and cancer. It is the mission of this project to identify molecular signatures that influence the risk of developing tumours employing established research tools and state-of-the-art genetic, biochemical, proteomic and transcriptomic as well as large scale CRISPR/Cas9 perturbation screening-based functional genomic technologies. Defining this as yet poorly elucidated effector pathway with its profoundly relevant role would enable development of preventive and immune-therapeutic strategies against NSCLC lung cancer and potentially also against other entities. Our three-pronged approach to achieve this goal is to: (i) delineate biological and clinical properties of the immunological PKC/NR2F6 network, (ii) validate NR2F6 as an immune-oncology combination target needed to overcome limitations to "first generation anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors" rendering T cells capable of rejecting tumours and their metastases at distal organs and (iii) exploit human combinatorial T cell therapy concepts for prevention of immune-related adverse events as well as of tumour recurrence by reducing opportunities for the tumour to develop resistance in the clinic. Insight into the functions of NR2F6 pathway and involved mechanisms is a prerequisite for understanding how the microenvironment at the tumour site either supports tumour growth and spread or prevents tumour initiation and progression, the latter by host-protective cancer immunity.

72	Professor Buss Folma	University of Cambridge	2016-03-01	2019-02-28	Investigating the role of Myosin VI in quality control of mitochondria linked to Parkinson's disease pathology	Because of its biological complexity, cancer is still poorly understood. Chronic inflammation has been shown, both experimentally and epidemiologically, to be a predisposition to, and also an inseparable aspect of clinically prevalent cancer entities. Therefore, a detailed understanding of both tumour and immune cell functions in cancer progression is a prerequisite for more successful therapeutic startegies. My team was the first to reveal the lymphocyte-intrinsic PKC/NR2F6 axis as an essential signalling node at the crossroads between inflammation and cancer. It is the mission of this project to identify molecular signatures that influence the risk of developing tumours employing established research tools and state-of-the-art genetic, biochemical, proteomic and transcriptomic as well as large scale CRISPR/Cas9 perturbation screening-based functional genomic technologies. Defining this as yet poorly elucidated effector pathway with its profoundly relevant role would enable development of preventive and immune-therapeutic strategies against NSCLC lung cancer and potentially also against other entities. Our three-pronged approach to achieve this goal is to: (i) delineate biological and clinical properties of the immunological PKC/NR2F6 network, (ii) validate NR2F6 as an immune-oncology combination target needed to overcome limitations to "first generation anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors" rendering T cells capable of rejecting tumours and their metastases at distal organs and (iii) exploit human combinatorial T cell therapy concepts for prevention of immune-related adverse events as well as of tumour recurrence by reducing opportunities for the tumour to develop resistance in the clinic.

To cope with this, life has evolved multiple DNA repair and associated processes, collectively termed the DNA-damage response (DDR). While considerable progress has been made in identifying DDR proteins and their regulators, much remains to be learned about how they operate and are controlled. Building on our successful proof-of-concept studies, we will carry out genome-wide and focused genetic screens via state-of-the-art CRISPR-Cas9 approaches and haploid-cell based chemical mutagenesis. Together with ensuing validation and mechanistic studies, the proposed research has the following interconnected goals: â¢ To identify novel genetic and functional relationships between DDR genes/proteins, and between these and other cellular components, thereby providing fundamental insights into how mammalian cells respond to DNA damage and defining how such responses are controlled and coordinated. â¢ To establish how defects and deregulation of certain DDR processes affect cellular sensitivity and resistance to established and emerging cancer therapies, and to explore the potential clinical relevance of these affects. â¢ To expand our knowledge of how DDR processes are affected by protein post-translational modifications, particularly ubiquitylation and phosphorylation.

In sharp contrast to the known role of mRNA 5â- caps and 3â-end poly (A) tails, the biochemistry and biology of terminal, RNA 2â,3â-cyclic phosphates remain largely unexplored. RNA molecules bearing 2â,3â-cyclic phosphates are generated by endonucleases, exonucleases or de novo synthesis, but their fate as intermediate substrates or final products of RNA processing reactions is obscure. Here, we report the identification and re-definition of the first RNA 2â,3â cyclic phosphatase in eukaryotic cells; ANGEL2, a member of the CCR4-NOT family of poly(A) ribonucleases with no previously demonstrated activity. ANGEL2 converts RNA terminal 2â,3â-cyclic phosphates into 2â,3â-OH nucleotides, likely through a 2â-phosphate intermediate with implied consecutive 2â,3â-cyclic phosphodiesterase and 2â-phosphatase activities. We have introduced mutations in the predicted active site of ANGEL2 and abrogated its enzymatic activity. We have also generated knockout and knockdown cells by CRISPR and shRNAs, respectively, where ANGEL2âs activity was eliminated. Expressing wild type ANGEL2, but not a catalytic mutant, recovered the activity. The way is paved for a thorough biochemical and in vivo investigation of the unique biology of ANGEL2, which we predict has a large impact on RNA stability and turnover, degradation and cellular processes involving RNA ligation reactions. Within the next four years, we will: a) study the biological function of ANGEL2 by acting on 2â,3â-cyclic phosphate-ended RNAs; b) dissect the reaction mechanism and structure of ANGEL2; c) identify associated proteins by mass spectrometry and RNA-targets in vitro via RNA-protein cross-linking and RNA sequencing; d) characterize animal knockout models at the phenotypic and molecular level; e) identify patients harboring mutations in ANGEL2 and explore defects in RNA pathways; and f) take advantage of the unique enzymatic activity of ANGEL2 to modify current protocols to clone 3â-phosphate ended RNAs and preserve the 5â-terminal chemistry of both 3â-phosphate and 2â,3â-cyclic phosphate ended RNAs.

One of the key cellular mechanisms of regulating the activity of many proteins on a posttranslational timescale is through protein degradation using the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Specificity of proteolysis for any particular substrate is determined by its association with a specific E3-receptor subunit. F-box proteins are the substrate-recognition components of the E3- ubiquitin ligases. The human and mouse genome comprises 70-75 F-box proteins that are incompletely studied. The analysis of gene function in vivo is not always possible due to the lethality of knockout mouse. The experimental plan will use previously developed in vitro 3D organoid cultures to study the functions of E3s. Lentiviral gene overexpression and CRISPR/Cas genome editing will be used to modify genes in organoids. We aim; 1) to develop a new fluorescent/luminescent-based screening for knockout organoids in combination with the CRISPR/Cas system. We will apply this method to analyse loss-of-function phenotype of FBXW7-E3 enriched in intestinal stem cells. 2) We will establish large scale CRISPR/Cas-mediated mutagenesis in organoid cultures by a gRNA-expressing organoid library targeting F-box-type E3-ligases. Site-specific mutagenesis in organoids will be generated by inducible Cas9 recombinase. For an example, we will these organoids to screen E3s essential for growth, proliferation and differentiation. gRNAs in mutant clones will be sequenced and the gene responsible for the phenotype will be identified. The main objectives are: i) to establish CRISPR/Cas and fluorescent/luminescent screening system for functional genetic tools in organoid cultures ii) to understand the role of F-box-type E3-ligases. This study will provide useful genetic tools for organoid cultures and will demonstrate the efficacy of in vitro system to study gene functions.

They are the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in the young through ventricular arrhythmias and also contribute substantially to heart failure, putting a major burden on health care systems. To develop specific therapies, it is necessary to understand the consequences of the genetic mutations at the molecular level. Model systems, such as cells, organoids and whole organisms are used to elucidate disease pathways. The animal models among them have a high ethical burden, therefore there is a need to replace them by cellular models. Induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM) have emerged as a novel model system to study inherited heart conditions and thereby provide an opportunity to replace animal models, especially mice, to study these genetic diseases. The advantage of the iPSC-CM system is their human physiology (e.g. beating rates and ion channel setups) and that genetic mutations can be introduced via CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome-editing. However, immaturity of iPSCCM proves a major obstacle in their utilisation, but novel 3D culturing methods such as engineered heart tissue (EHT) have been shown to result in more mature characteristics of iPSC-CM. Titin truncation variants (TTNtv) are found in up to 25 % of patients suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy, one of the major inherited cardiac conditions. There is an increased burden of ventricular arrhythmias in these patients as well as a link of TTNtv and atrial fibrillation (a form of atrial arrhythmia), indicating that TTNtv can predispose to arrhythmias in both settings. The main scientific objective of the project is to develop iPSC-CM derived cellular model systems (both 2D and 3D) to study the predisposition to atrial and ventricular arrhythmias caused by mutations in cardiac genes. This will provide an alternative to in vivo mouse models commonly used, which can be highly invasive. TTNtv, linked to ventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation in humans, will be used as example mutations.	British Heart Foundation	Research Grant	90000.0GBP

85	Dr Bergen Dylan	University of Bristol	2019-04-01	2022-03-21	Determining new osteo-anabolic targets using zebrafish models of human genomic study discoveries	Over 3-million people in the UK have osteoporosis and suffer bone fragility due to an altered balance of bone-building osteoblast and bone-resorbing osteoclast activity. Most available therapies are anti-resorptive, targeting osteoclasts which halt bone loss, rather than building new bone. Osteo-anabolic treatments are few; new compounds are needed as our population ages and fracture numbers rise. I will exploit the rich genetic learning from two unique studies to identify novel bone regulatory pathways, amenable to therapeutic manipulation for treating osteoporosis. The evolutionarily conserved zebrafish model allows quick screening of osteo-anabolic target genes by combining efficient CRISPR-Cas9 genome-engineering, rapid skeletal development and translucency; enabling skeletal imaging with fluorescent transgenic lines. I will use the latest data from (1) UK-Biobank genome wide association study of bone mineral density (BMD) and (2) whole-exome sequencing analysis of 22 pedigrees with unexplained monogenic high bone-mass (HBM), two unique datasets which together have identified hundreds of potential novel osteo-anabolic genes. I will deploy my newly developed in-silico prioritisation pipeline to objectively select genes for functional investigation in zebrafish. Preliminary in-silico prioritisation identified DOT1L histone-H3 methyltransferase as a novel BMD factor and proof-of-concept data demonstrated a HBM phenotype in dot1l mutant zebrafish. The efficient CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing protocol will in addition generate loss-of-function mutants of several prioritised genes. These mutants will be imaged for osteoblast number, skeletal development and morphology. I will learn and deploy state-of-the-art methods to ex-vivo culture of adult zebrafish scales, containing dermal bone decorated with osteoblasts and osteoclasts. This new approach will allow investigation of responses to compounds hypothesised to affect prioritised osteo-anabolic targets and enable compound screening in a gene-specific setting. This exciting high-impact collaborative research will launch my independent scientific career, focussing on osteoblast biology in-vivo, compounds for osteo-anabolic pharmacotherapies, aiming to generate cutting-edge pre-clinical data to inform future drug trials.

Prof.Dr. MIKULITS Wolfgang	Medical University of Vienna	2019-06-03	2022-12-02	Role of Axl Receptor Shedding in Liver Cancer	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents the major subtype of liver cancer showing the second highest cancer-related mortality worldwide. A prominent feature of HCC is the development from chronic liver diseases (CLDs) such as virally-induced hepatitis or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/steatohepatitis that occurs predominantly in the setting of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. Signalling of the receptor tyrosine kinase Axl by binding of its ligand Gas6 to the ectodomain is essentially involved in the progression of fibrosis and the development of HCC. Notably, shedding of the Axl ectodomain, resulting in soluble Axl (sAxl), provides a highly accurate biomarker for the diagnosis of advanced liver fibrosis/cirrhosis, and early to late HCC in the absence and presence of cirrhosis. These observations raise the question whether the cleavage of sAxl either (i) leads to Gas6-independing Axl signalling, or (ii) does not affect Axl signalling by abundant expression of wild type Axl together with available free Gas6, or (iii) dampens an anti-oncogenic Axl signal. In this project, we will address the role of Axl receptor shedding as a driver of liver fibrosis and HCC development by using human CRISPR/Cas9 liver models, Axl-deficient mouse models and CLD/HCC patient samples. Gas6-dependent and Gas6-independent Axl targets will be identified by RNA-Seq analysis and further examined by gain- and loss-of-functions studies in vitro and in vivo for their mechanistic impact on liver fibrosis and HCC. Moreover, a chemical compound screening will be employed to identify novel Axl treatment targets that can be exploited for the reversion of liver fibrosis and ablation of HCC. Altogether, this project will yield novel insights into Axl receptor shedding that could be used for innovative strategies to efficiently combat liver fibrosis and HCC .

87	Professor Bingle Colin	University of Sheffield	2017-01-01	2017-12-31	Gene editing in the middle ear: Gene deletion at will for the study of Otitis Media.	The middle ear is an air-filled cavity, containing the three smallest bones in the body (the ossicles), which are crucial for hearing. The cavity is lined with a layer of cells, called an epithelium, which contains multiple types of cells that provide protection for the cavity. The epithelium surrounding the middle ear is the target of pathogens, such as bacteria, that cause middle ear infections (known collectively as otitis media). This is one of the most common infections of childhood â by the age of 3, over four out of every five children will have had a middle ear infection â and there are over 700 million cases each year across the world. It is the most common reason for prescribing antibiotics, and one of the leading causes of childhood surgery. Although in most cases, the infection is temporary and clears up relatively straightforwardly, if the infection becomes chronic (called chronic otitis media with effusion, or COME), it can cause permanent damage to the ear, and permanent hearing loss â over 100 million people worldwide are thought to have hearing loss caused by otitis media. COME is thought to be caused by an out-of-control inflammatory response to a trigger such as a pathogen, and this response causes changes to the epithelium itself â including an increase in the number of mucus-producing cells, which contribute to the effusion from the ear. The processes underlying these changes are not well understood â it is difficult to obtain samples of affected tissue to study. Professor Bingle and his team have recently developed a âmodelâ of the middle ear epithelium, grown in the lab from middle ear cells taken from the mouse, which will help us to better understand otitis media. The cells in this model grow at the interface between the liquid culture medium (which provides the cells with the nutrients they need to grow and develop and communicate with each other), and air â this is very similar to the way in which they grow in the middle ear, and makes this model highly relevant, as the cells develop and grow much like they do in the middle ear. One of the advantages of this model is that it will allow researchers studying otitis media to investigate the role of particular genes in the processes that lead to it. Using a new genetic engineering technology called CRISPR/Cas9, the researchers will edit one of the genes in the cells, called Foxj1, which is known to control the development of the mucus-producing cells that are implicated in otitis media (COME). This will not only demonstrate the ability to use gene editing to alter these cells to study the role of particular genes, but will also provide insight into how disrupting Foxj1 impacts on the middle ear epithelium as a whole, and the development of otitis media. This project could lead to the development of a new tool to study otitis media, and a system which can be used to test potential drugs for their ability to treat this condition, making it of great value to the research community.

However, this requires development of new technology. Advancing state-of-the-art: We propose a paradigm shift in gene therapy for chronic ischemia by activating endogenous VEGF-A,-B and -C genes and angiogenic transcription programs from the native promoters instead of gene transfer of exogenous cDNA to target tissues. We will develop a new platform technology (endogenetherapy) based on our novel concept of the release of promoter pausing and new promoter-targeted upregulating short hairpinRNAs, tissue-specific superenhancerRNAs activating specific transcription centers involving gene clusters in different chromosomal regions, small circularRNAs formed from self-splicing exons-introns that can be regulated with oligonucleotides and small molecules such as metabolites, nuclear RNAi vectors and specific CRISPR/gRNAmutatedCas9-VP16 technology with an ability to target integration into genomic safe harbor sites. After preclinical studies in mice and in a newly developed chronic cardiac ischemia model in pigs with special emphasis on the analysis of clinically relevant blood flow, metabolic and functional outcomes based on MRI, ultrasound, photoacoustic and PET imaging, the best construct will be taken to a phase I clinical study in patients with severe myocardial ischemia. Since endogenetherapy also involves epigenetic changes, which are reversible and long-lasting, we expect to efficiently activate natural angiogenic programs. Significance: If successful, this approach will begin a new era in gene therapy. Since there is a clear lack of technology capable of targeted upregulation of endogenous genes, the novel endogenetherapy approach may become widely applicable beyond cardiovascular diseases also in other areas of medicine and biomedical research.

89	Professor Bingle Colin	VIB	2018-07-01	2023-06-30	Harnessing tumor metabolism to overcome immunosupression	Anti-cancer immunotherapy has provided patients with a promising treatment. Yet, it has also unveiled that the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) hampers the efficiency of this therapeutic option and limits its success. The concept that metabolism is able to shape the immune response has gained general acceptance. Nonetheless, little is known on how the metabolic crosstalk between different tumor compartments contributes to the harsh TME and ultimately impairs T cell fitness within the tumor. This proposal aims to decipher which metabolic changes in the TME impede proper anti-tumor immunity. Starting from the meta-analysis of public human datasets, corroborated by metabolomics and transcriptomics data from several mouse tumors, we ranked clinically relevant and altered metabolic pathways that correlate with resistance to immunotherapy. Using a CRISPR/Cas9 platform for their functional in vivo selection, we want to identify cancer cell intrinsic metabolic mediators and, indirectly, distinguish those belonging specifically to the stroma. By means of genetic tools and small molecules, we will modify promising metabolic pathways in cancer cells and stromal cells (particularly in tumor-associated macrophages) to harness tumor immunosuppression. In a mirroring approach, we will apply a similar screening tool on cytotoxic T cells to identify metabolic targets that enhance their fitness under adverse growth conditions.

By analyzing the metabolic network and crosstalk within the tumor, this project will shed light on how metabolism contributes to the immunosuppressive TME and T cell maladaptation. The overall goal is to identify druggable metabolic targets that i) reinforce the intrinsic anti-tumor immune response by breaking immunosuppression and ii) promote T cell function in immunotherapeutic settings by rewiring either the TME or the T cell itself.

Yet, it has also unveiled that the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) hampers the efficiency of this therapeutic option and limits its success. The concept that metabolism is able to shape the immune response has gained general acceptance. Nonetheless, little is known on how the metabolic crosstalk between different tumor compartments contributes to the harsh TME and ultimately impairs T cell fitness within the tumor. This proposal aims to decipher which metabolic changes in the TME impede proper anti-tumor immunity. Starting from the meta-analysis of public human datasets, corroborated by metabolomics and transcriptomics data from several mouse tumors, we ranked clinically relevant and altered metabolic pathways that correlate with resistance to immunotherapy. Using a CRISPR/Cas9 platform for their functional in vivo selection, we want to identify cancer cell intrinsic metabolic mediators and, indirectly, distinguish those belonging specifically to the stroma. By means of genetic tools and small molecules, we will modify promising metabolic pathways in cancer cells and stromal cells (particularly in tumor-associated macrophages) to harness tumor immunosuppression. In a mirroring approach, we will apply a similar screening tool on cytotoxic T cells to identify metabolic targets that enhance their fitness under adverse growth conditions. This will allow us to manipulate T cells ex vivo and to therapeutically intervene via adoptive T cell transfer.

Chronic inflammation has been shown, both experimentally and epidemiologically, to be a predisposition to, and also an inseparable aspect of clinically prevalent cancer entities. Therefore, a detailed understanding of both tumour and immune cell functions in cancer progression is a prerequisite for more successful therapeutic startegies. My team was the first to reveal the lymphocyte-intrinsic PKC/NR2F6 axis as an essential signalling node at the crossroads between inflammation and cancer. It is the mission of this project to identify molecular signatures that influence the risk of developing tumours employing established research tools and state-of-the-art genetic, biochemical, proteomic and transcriptomic as well as large scale CRISPR/Cas9 perturbation screening-based functional genomic technologies. Defining this as yet poorly elucidated effector pathway with its profoundly relevant role would enable development of preventive and immune-therapeutic strategies against NSCLC lung cancer and potentially also against other entities. Our three-pronged approach to achieve this goal is to: (i) delineate biological and clinical properties of the immunological PKC/NR2F6 network, (ii) validate NR2F6 as an immune-oncology combination target needed to overcome limitations to "first generation anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors" rendering T cells capable of rejecting tumours and their metastases at distal organs and (iii) exploit human combinatorial T cell therapy concepts for prevention of immune-related adverse events as well as of tumour recurrence by reducing opportunities for the tumour to develop resistance in the clinic. Insight into the functions of NR2F6 pathway and involved mechanisms is a prerequisite for understanding how the microenvironment at the tumour site either supports tumour growth and spread or prevents tumour initiation and progression, the latter by host-protective cancer immunity.

Only a few regulators (Blimp1, IRF4, XBP1, Aiolos, Ikaros and E-proteins) have been implicated in the transcriptional control of antibody-secreting cells, and their target genes, with the exception of Blimp1 and E-proteins, are still unknown. This proposal aims to systematically identify key players in the development and function of antibody-secreting cells by using the CRISPR/Cas9 and Cre/loxP methods. For this, we improved existing protocols to extend the duration of in vitro plasmablast differentiation and showed that Rosa26(Cas9/+) B cells infected with Blimp1 or Xbp1 sgRNA-expressing retroviruses recapitulated the Blimp1 and Xbp1 mutant phenotypes in this proof-of-principle experiment. Moreover, Cre retrovirus-mediated deletion of Irf4, Ikaros and Aiolos strongly impaired plasmablast differentiation in this optimized system. To discover new regulators of plasma cell differentiation, CRISPR/Cas9-based screens will be performed with pooled sgRNA libraries targeting all known upregulated genes in plasmablasts and plasma cells, followed by individual validation of the best hits. Selected top-ranked genes will be analyzed in vivo by conditional mutagenesis with newly generated, plasma cell-specific Cre lines. Regulated target genes of IRF4, Ikaros, Aiolos, XBP1 and the XBP1-regulated transcription factor Bhlha15 will be identified in plasmablasts by ChIP- and RNA-seq analyses. Target genes with potentially interesting functions will be further characterized by CRISPR/Cas9- or Cre/loxP-mediated mutagenesis. These experiments will provide fundamentally new insight into the molecular mechanisms controlling the development and function of antibody-secreting cells, which are the essential effector cells of humoral immunity.

The study will offer important insights into the function of SLCs, most of which are poorly characterized, and is expected to shed light into the intertwining of metabolism and signaling and, potentially, open up possibilities to stop viruses by starving them of key building blocks. Both research areas, viral-host interactions and solute carrier proteins, are increasingly becoming the object of significant research efforts from the scientific community. At the same time, it would be inappropriate to consider them mainstream yet. Research on solute carrier proteins has traditionally been focused on individual proteins and individual transport phenomena and it is only through relatively recent efforts of pioneering individuals and initiatives that over-arching themes and connections are becoming apparent. We aim to characterize the role of host SLCs in the viral life cycle as well as confirm their function as a new regulatory group of proteins in the antiviral immune response. Upon integration of the multiple large-scale datasets from recent genome-wide screens, a group of 20 SLC proteins has been identified to have a function linked to viral replication or immune response. We will systematically inactivate the genes encoding these SLCs using CRISPR/Cas9 technology in the haploid human cell line HAP1 and screen for the effect of these mutations on the susceptibility of the cells to virus infection. Moreover, we will study the protein-protein interactions of the most interesting candidates and will try to deduce, through metabolomics and bioinformatics approaches, the natural cargo that may be critical during the viral life-cycle. Together, this âviral transportomeâ will offer new insights into possible strategies to pharmacologically interfere with viral infections. We are seeking support for one postdoctoral fellow and a 50% time commitment from a technical assistant in order to complete this proposal. They will complement the efforts currently made by PhD student Anna Moskovskich, who generated the SLC KO lines and is already involved in setting up the primary and secondary screens with several viruses. We will work closely with Keiryn Bennett, the group leader of the CeMM Proteomics facility and a world-renowned mass spectometrist, who will help and assist with the proteomics and metabolomics aims of the project. Moreover, this proposal will also benefit from collaborations with Douglas Kell (University of Manchester, UK) and Matthias Hediger (University of Bern, CH) and from the virology expertise of Gijs Versteeg (MFPL, AT) and Franz Heinz (MUW, AT).

Tight control of alternative splicing is very important as evidenced by linkage of abnormal alternative splicing with numerous human diseases including cancer. Exon skipping/inclusion is the major alternative splicing event in human, therefore genome-wide studies of cancer-associated alternative splicing have been well focused on detection and characterization of this type of event. Recently, we have discovered unusual alternative splicing that we termed exitron (exonic intron) splicing. Exitrons are internal regions of protein-coding exons and have features of both exons and introns. Exitron splicing results in protein isoforms with altered sequences and often affects protein domains and various post-translational modification sites. Strikingly, at least 3.7% of human protein-coding genes contain exitrons as evidenced by analyses of seven tissue and one breast cancer transcriptomes. Here we propose a project based on our findings that 1) exitron splicing involves genes with reported functions in cancer; 2) exitron splicing broadly affects features of proteins encoded by cancer-related genes; 3) mutations affect exitron splicing in cancer-associated genes; and 4) ~9% of exitron splicing events are misregulated in breast cancer involving genes with implicated functions in cancer. We aim to elucidate a link between exitron splicing and cancer so far never explored in different cancer types. To this end, we will identify misregulated exitron splicing events in various solid tumours by using publicly available RNA-seq datasets. We will use RT-PCR and Lariat-seq, extensive sequencing of splicing-derived lariat RNAs, to validate exitron splicing. We will examine functional relevance of misregulated exitrons regarding their effects on protein isoform features. We will test impact of misregulated exitron-retained/spliced isoforms using siRNA/CRISPR-mediated knockdown/outs together with various functional assays. We are interested to elucidate basis of exitron splicing regulation. The unique feature of exitrons as intra-exonic sequences implies specific recognition mechanism and requirements for regulating their splicing. Hence, we will investigate splicing regulatory elements and splicing factors implicated in exitron splicing. We assume that exitron splicing takes place on mature spliced mRNA via mRNA re-splicing, and we will examine this hypothesis. Taken together, this project will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of alternative splicing. Identified set of exitron splicing events will complement the repertoire of the known alternative splicing events misregulated in cancer and may lead to the development of novel cancer markers and/or therapeutic targets.

Here we propose a project based on our findings that 1) exitron splicing involves genes with reported functions in cancer; 2) exitron splicing broadly affects features of proteins encoded by cancer-related genes; 3) mutations affect exitron splicing in cancer-associated genes; and 4) ~9% of exitron splicing events are misregulated in breast cancer involving genes with implicated functions in cancer. We aim to elucidate a link between exitron splicing and cancer so far never explored in different cancer types. To this end, we will identify misregulated exitron splicing events in various solid tumours by using publicly available RNA-seq datasets. We will use RT-PCR and Lariat-seq, extensive sequencing of splicing-derived lariat RNAs, to validate exitron splicing. We will examine functional relevance of misregulated exitrons regarding their effects on protein isoform features. We will test impact of misregulated exitron-retained/spliced isoforms using siRNA/CRISPR-mediated knockdown/outs together with various functional assays. We are interested to elucidate basis of exitron splicing regulation. The unique feature of exitrons as intra-exonic sequences implies specific recognition mechanism and requirements for regulating their splicing. Hence, we will investigate splicing regulatory elements and splicing factors implicated in exitron splicing. We assume that exitron splicing takes place on mature spliced mRNA via mRNA re-splicing, and we will examine this hypothesis. Taken together, this project will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of alternative splicing. Identified set of exitron splicing events will complement the repertoire of the known alternative splicing events misregulated in cancer and may lead to the development of novel cancer markers and/or therapeutic targets.

They are the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in the young through ventricular arrhythmias and also contribute substantially to heart failure, putting a major burden on health care systems. To develop specific therapies, it is necessary to understand the consequences of the genetic mutations at the molecular level. Model systems, such as cells, organoids and whole organisms are used to elucidate disease pathways. The animal models among them have a high ethical burden, therefore there is a need to replace them by cellular models. Induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM) have emerged as a novel model system to study inherited heart conditions and thereby provide an opportunity to replace animal models, especially mice, to study these genetic diseases. The advantage of the iPSC-CM system is their human physiology (e.g. beating rates and ion channel setups) and that genetic mutations can be introduced via CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome-editing. However, immaturity of iPSC-CM proves a major obstacle in their utilisation, but novel 3D culturing methods such as engineered heart tissue (EHT) have been shown to result in more mature characteristics of iPSC-CM. Titin truncation variants (TTNtv) are found in up to 25 % of patients suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy, one of the major inherited cardiac conditions. There is an increased burden of ventricular arrhythmias in these patients as well as a link of TTNtv and atrial fibrillation (a form of atrial arrhythmia), indicating that TTNtv can predispose to arrhythmias in both settings. The main scientific objective of the project is to develop iPSC-CM derived cellular model systems (both 2D and 3D) to study the predisposition to atrial and ventricular arrhythmias caused by mutations in cardiac genes. This will provide an alternative to in vivo mouse models commonly used, which can be highly invasive. TTNtv, linked to ventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation in humans, will be used as example mutations. Specific aims of the project are: 1.) Introduction of two pathogenic TTNtv into iPSC, done in collaboration with Prof C Denning (University of Nottingham), using optimised genome-editing protocols. 2.) Development of protocols to differentiate Kolf2 iPSC into ventricular and atrial iPSC-CM While differentiation into ventricular iPSC-CM is established in the lab, differentiation protocols for atrial iPSC-CM using retinoic acid will be established. 3.) Generation of EHT from atrial and ventricular iPSC-CM Generation of ventricular EHT is established in the lab, however atrial EHT is a novel approach to be established. Enhanced maturity of both ventricular and atrial EHT will be documented by comparison to 2D cultures of the same iPSC-CM (atrial/ventricular). 4.) Characterisation of electric disturbances in iPSC-CM in the presence of TTNtv 2D cultures of atrial and ventricular iPSC-CM with and without TTNtv will be assessed using optical mapping, multi-electrode arrays and measurements of calcium transients. Spontaneous electric activity of atrial and ventricular EHTs will be assessed by optical mapping. Challenge experiments will apply arrhythmia-inducing drugs to provoke or enhance arrhythmic behaviour. The work of aims 2 to 4 will be carried out at the University of Birmingham (UoB), guided by Dr. K Gehmlich and Prof P Kirchhof. 5.) Modelling of electric disturbances Under guidance by Prof B Rodriguez (University of Oxford), computational modelling will provide insight into underlying molecular changes responsible for arrhythmic behaviour. Identified targets will be validated by biochemical and electrophysiological methods. By the end of the project the student will have a thorough understanding which arrhythmic aspects of TTNtv can be modelled in iPSC-CM derived cellular systems and how computational modelling can aide the experimental work.

There is currently no cure for osteoarthritis and a paucity of pharmaceutical options. Osteoarthritis has a complex etiology with a strong genetic component and associations with obesity and the immune system in addition to wear and tear of the joint. Understanding how genes identified from association studies function at a cellular level and how they interact with the functional joint environment (e.g. with loading and the immune system) offer the best prospect for prioritising targets for drug development. My group have pioneered the use of zebrafish to study skeletal disease. We have developed transgenic lines and optimised imaging techniques that allow dynamic visualisation of the cells of the skeleton in the intact fish. We have generated and characterised 18 stable lines carrying mutations in genes associated with human osteoarthritis, which show skeletal phenotypes that resemble human skeletal conditions. In this fellowship I will expand the pipeline we have developed to test the functional effects of genes on the skeleton; using CRISPR/cas9 mutagenesis to rapidly generate mutations in genes of interest that can be screened in 5 day old larvae for joint shape and function, skeletal cell activity and immune response. We will test genes associated with osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and high bone mass. We will build on our preliminary data showing increased macrophage recruitment to joints of mutant fish, to test how the innate immune system influences osteoarthritis development and test the role of obesity in pathogenesis. We will optimise in vivo screening assays using zebrafish and perform proof of concept screens with known compounds to test for skeletal effects. Together this work will expand our functional knowledge of how genes confer risk and use this knowledge to develop new treatments.	Versus Arthritis	Senior Research Fellowship	937090.0GBP

Such cells can be obtained by in vitro direct reprogramming of somatic cells into embryonic stem (ES)-like cells, termed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). This approach also opens possibilities for modelling human diseases in vitro. However, major hurdles remain that restrain fulfilling conventional human iPSC/ESC potential, as they reside in an advanced primed pluripotent state. Such hurdles include limited differentiation capacity and functional variability. Further, in vitro iPSC based research platforms are simplistic and iPSC based âhumanizedâ chimeric mouse models may be of great benefit. The recent isolation of distinct and new âmouse-likeâ naive pluripotent states in humans that correspond to earlier embryonic developmental state(s), constitutes a paradigm shift and may alleviate limitations of conventional primed iPSCs/ESCs. Thus, our proposal aims at dissecting the human naÃ¯ve pluripotent state(s) and to unveil pathways that facilitate their unique identity and flexible programming. Specific goals: 1) Transcriptional and Epigenetic Design Principles of Human NaÃ¯ve Pluripotency 2) Signalling Principles Governing Human NaÃ¯ve Pluripotency Maintenance and Differentiation 3) Defining Functional Competence and Safety of Human NaÃ¯ve Pluripotent Stem Cells in vitro 4) Novel human naÃ¯ve iPSC based cross-species chimeric mice for studying human differentiation and disease modelling in vivo. These aims will be conducted by utilizing engineered human iPSC/ESC models, CRISPR/Cas9 genome-wide screening, advanced microscopy and ex-vivo whole embryo culture methods. Our goals will synergistically lead to the design of strategies that will accelerate the safe medical application of human naive pluripotent stem cells and their use in disease specific modelling and applied stem cell research.

The leading hypothesis for such coevolution is based on time-lagged negative frequency dependent selection (NFDS), also known as Red Queen coevolution. Evidence from population genetics (e.g. high genetic diversity and balancing selection at disease loci) is consistent with the idea that NFDS drives coevolution in host-parasite systems, but other models of coevolution (e.g., selective sweeps) cannot be easily excluded. Here I propose to test the predictions of the Red Queen coevolution hypothesis by analysis of hosts and parasite dynamics in one well-characterized population. In this Daphnia magna population we observe yearly strong epidemics of the bacterial parasite Pasteuria ramosa. I propose to test the hypothesis that coevolution in this system is driven by NFDS. Subproject A aims to identify the host genes that prevent parasite attachment in one particular population (âThe Swisspondâ), which has yearly strong epidemics of Pasteuria ramosa. We plan to compare different host-genotypes by sequencing from each resistotype multiple genomes and conduct genome-wide association mapping. In a next step we aim to pinpoint the exact genes responsible for the resistance polymorphism by employing molecular tools (CRISPR/Cas9) to knock down candidate genes in the regions of interest. The cloned offspring of the knock down genotypes will be tested for phenotypic effects in response to multiple parasite clones.Subproject B continues our efforts to find the infectivity genes in the bacterial pathogen Pasteuria. This parasite has now been fully sequenced and genomes from different isolates with known infection characteristics will be compared. As a further step we plan to do a proteomics approach, to identify the proteins which are expressed on the spore surface and which are responsible for the attachment of the parasite to the host. Subproject C aims to uncover the genetic interaction matrix between host and parasite genotypes. Host and parasite isolates from the field will be cloned in the laboratory and the mode of inheritance of resistance will be worked out by conducting genetic crosses among hosts. At the same time, infected hosts will be collected across the course of an epidemic in the field and will be genotypes for candidate genes at host resistance loci and parasite infectivity loci. This âco-genotypingâ will allow estimating the strength of genetic host-parasite interactions during natural epidemics and enable us to estimate the strength of selection acting on different genotypes. Expected value of the research: This research aims to provide a convincing case study on the validity and predictions of the Red Queen coevolution hypothesis, offering urgently needed genetic data for theoretical and empirical research in evolution, epidemiology and disease biology. It has implications for our understanding of how coevolution shapes genetic diversity and genomes.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div. I-III)	834000.0CHF
109	Dr. HANNA Yaqub	University of Berne	2015-10-01	2018-09-30	Quality control of gene expression: towards understanding mechanism and physiological role of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD)	The term âNonsense-Mediated mRNA Decayâ (NMD) was originally coined to describe a translation-dependent process that degrades mRNAs with truncated open reading frames (ORFs). By recognizing and degrading mRNAs with premature termination codons (PTCs), many of which arise by alternative splicing, NMD serves as a quality control of gene expression and protects the cell from accumulating C-terminally truncated proteins with potentially toxic functions. However, a more general role of NMD in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression emerged from transcriptome-wide mRNA profilings that identified many physiological (i.e. PTC-free) mRNAs as NMD targets, overall affecting the mRNA levels of 3 - 10% of all genes in yeast, Drosophila, and human cells. NMD is essential in vertebrates and an important modulator of genetic disease phenotypes in humans, since 30% of all known disease-causing mutations are predicted to trigger NMD.Over the past 10 years, our lab has contributed both to the dissection of the molecular mechanism of NMD as well as to a better understanding of the biological function of NMD in mammalian cells. With the projects proposed here, we aim at continuing our research along these two lines by using a combination of biochemical, molecular biology, cell biology and reverse genetics methods. We plan to generate several inducible pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines with mutations in various NMD factors and assess their effect on the transcriptome and the capability of the cells to differentiate. The mutations will be introduced using recently developed genome-editing techniques (CRISPR/Cas). Compared to traditional knockdown-rescue experiments, the genome editing approach has the advantage that the effect of the mutant proteins can be assessed in the absence of any remaining low levels of WT protein possibly confounding the phenotype. On the biochemical side, one of our main goals is to establish a protocol to purify specific messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) populations that have been arrested at different stages along the NMD pathway and characterizing their composition by mass spectrometry. This will give us important insight into mRNP remodeling events during NMD. A third line of research concerns a follow-up of our recent finding that NMD appears to play a role in defending cells from RNA virus replication. We want to find out what makes the Semliki Forest Virus genomic RNA an NMD substrate and test other viruses for their sensitivity to NMD.Collectively, our research aims at understanding the molecular mechanism of NMD and its physiological role in human cells. This is the basis for the future development of highly specific approaches to manipulate in a controlled way NMD activity in different disease contexts.

110	Ao. Prof. Dr. MARTENS Sascha	University of Vienna	2015-06-01	2018-05-31	On the role of the Atg11 homology domain during selective autophagy	Autophagy is an intracellular process that mediates the bulk degradation of cellular material. During autophagy double membrane-bound vesicles called autophagosomes are formed de novo. Autophagosomes initially appear as small membrane structures called isolation membranes that gradually expand and thereby sequester cellular material. After their formation autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes (in complex eukaryotes) or the vacuole (in yeast) wherein the cargo is degraded. Autophagy thereby protects cells and thus the organism from various stresses including periods of starvation, protein aggregates, intracellular pathogens and damaged organelles. Consequently autophagy has been linked to various human diseases. It is becoming increasingly clear that autophagy can be highly selective with regard to the cargo that is captures within autophagosomes. Cargo receptor proteins specifically bind the cargo link it to the autophagic machinery via their interaction with scaffold proteins. In this proposal we will focus on the conserved Atg11-homology domain in the S. cerevisiae scaffold protein Atg11 and the human FIP200 protein. S. cerevisiae Atg11 interacts with the Atg19 cargo receptor and our preliminary results show that human FIP200 interacts with the p62 cargo receptor. Both interactions are mediated by the C-terminal Atg11 homology domain in the Atg11 and FIP200 scaffold proteins, respectively. Using biochemistry we will fine map these interactions and determine the structure of the Atg11-homology domain by X-ray crystallography. The biochemical and structural results will be tested in reconstitution systems employing cell lysates from CRISPR/Cas9 genome edited human cells and in assays for selective autophagy in S. cerevisiae and human cells lines. The experiments proposed here will yield fascinating insights into the coupling of selective autophagy cargo to the autophagic machinery. The cargo receptors and autophagic scaffold proteins are playing key roles and our experiments will help to unravel the mechanisms underlying this important process.

In particular, mirroring their unparalleled morphological and cellular complexity, vertebrate brains show the highest levels of regulated AS known in nature. However, the functions of most of these alternative transcripts, and the evolutionary impact that the increased transcriptional complexity has had on the evolution of the vertebrate brain are still widely unexplored. In this project, we will investigate the functions and evolutionary impact of neural AS in vertebrates. We will focus on neural-specific alternative exons that are highly conserved across vertebrate groups (suggesting functional importance), but that are not conserved in invertebrates, and are thus vertebrate-specific genomic novelties. We will term these exons Vertebrate- and Neural-specific Alternatively Spliced (VN-AS) exons. Through a combination of bioinformatics, experimental manipulation in models species, and systems-level network analysis, we aim to: (i) Comprehensively identify VN-AS exons, and study their regulation during vertebrate neurogenesis and nervous system development, using RNA-seq and comparative genomics; (ii) Probe the phenotypic impact of VN-AS exons on vertebrate nervous systems, using the CRISPR-Cas technology for genome editing; and (iii) Investigate how VN-AS exons rewire protein-protein interaction networks in vertebrate neurons - an emergent molecular function for AS -, and whether this rewiring underlies novel functions of VN-AS exons in the vertebrate brains. This project will thus deliver fundamental insight into two major unanswered questions: (i) what are the functions of transcriptomic diversification, and (ii) how does transcriptomic diversification impact organismal evolution. Our results will fill a large gap of knowledge in our current understanding of brain evolution and development, providing a complementary angle to traditional gene expression studies.

Moreover, 2 â 3 years of chemotherapy are associated with significant morbidity and rare but potentially life-changing long-term toxicity, necessitating the need for more effective and less toxic therapies. Aims: The vision for this programme is to develop rationally designed, small molecule-based combination therapies for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: combinations that are highly active, non-toxic and prevent the emergence of resistant subclones. Methods: These combinations will be based on: â¢ Targeted therapies that we are currently taking into early phase clinical trials in children with relapsed ALL (e.g. MEK and BCL2 inhibition) â¢ Hypotheses-driven approaches (e.g. reactivation of p53, a key mediator of negative selection in normal B cell development) â¢ Functional CRISPR screens in patient-derived cells to identify synthetic vulnerabilities in the context of exposure to targeted therapies â¢ The identification of therapeutic targets through genome-wide CRISPR screens and the analysis of leukaemia-specific gene splicing Genome-wide CRISPR screening in the context of targeted therapies offers a step change in our ability to interrogate pathway dependencies and to select the most suitable inhibitors for effective combination therapies. Unbiased CRISPR screening in patient-derived cells and the analysis of plant homeodomain finger protein 5A (PHF5A)-mediated RNA splicing will determine the key drivers of the malignant phenotype in ALL. Our screens will identify opportunities for repurposing drugs already in clinical development and provide new targets for drug discovery. Most importantly, they will inform the translational/preclinical component of our programme in which we will test novel combination therapies using patient-derived cells in clinically relevant ex vivo and in vivo models. How the results of this research will be used: Our programme will generate robust preclinical data for novel combination therapies, based on mechanistic hypotheses and unbiased screening approaches, as the basis for innovative early phase clinical trials.

General aim To interrogate the role of V(D)J recombination defects in Common Variable Immunodeficiency Disorders Background The Common Variable Immunodeficiency disorders (CVIDs) comprise a group of heterogeneous primary antibody deficiencies and form the most clinically significant antibody failure in adults and children. For the majority of CVID patients the condition is sporadic, heterogeneous and polygenic. We have applied whole genome sequencing techniques to a small cohort of spor adic CVID patients in order to develop analysis pipelines for studying this cohort. Our preliminary findings reveal multiple variants in the DNA repair pathway, in particular the V(D)J recombination associated genes. Specific aims 1 To use next generation sequencing techniques to identify V(D)J recombination defects on CVID patients. 2 To establish a causative link by mimicking identified defects in fibroblast cell lines using the CRISPR-Cas9 system and studying the functional effect, by analysing expression and radiosensitivity using the gH2AX assay. 3 To link the genetic and functional defects back to the clinical phenotype. Significance The expected outcome is the identification of a subgroup of CVID patients with defects in V(D)J recombination explaining their complex phenotype. This will lead to better stratification, earlier diagnosis and potential new treatments targeting the DNA repair pathway.	Wellcome Trust	Seed Award in Science	97324.0GBP

Researchers have used mice and rats to model kidney damage seen in human patients with diabetes, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, lupus and fibrosis injury. Although many useful gene and protein targets have emerged from these studies, rodent models are limited for a number of reasons. One is the ethical issues around the numbers of mice in particular that are needed to generate gene knockouts, particularly tissue-specific knockouts (usually in the 100s-1000s). A second limitation is the fact that mice and rat models do not faithfully recapitulate the disease phenotype seen in the human kidney. For example, the most commonly used genetic strain of mice, C57Bl/6, are resistant to diabetes-induced kidney damage. Many gene and proteins that have been identified in rodent models have failed to materialise as bona fide targets when tested in humans. These limitations have led to a growing frustration in academia and industry, and led to the drive to improve our models of CKD. We propose to establish a new model of kidney injury based on 3D organoids derived from human iPS cells. Our protocol of differentiation triggers the formation of both glomerular and tubular epithelial cells that form themselves into glomerular-like and tubule-like structures (Fig. 2). These organoids will form the basis of the three interrelated project aims, which will use cell biology, microscopy and single cell sequencing to interrogate the genetic profile of the kidney organoid cells (Aim 1). We will then establish a range of new models of CKD exposing organoids to high glucose and other important drivers of kidney disease to induce damage. Cutting-edge single cell sequencing using the 10 x Genomics platform (https://www.10xgenomics.com) will be applied in-house to interrogate the genetic profiles of each of the different kidney-like cells in 3D organoids in normal versus disease conditions. The sequencing data obtained from the various organoid damage models will then be compared to existing datasets from previously used rodent models of disease available on the GEO bioinformatics platform (e.g. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/GDSbrowser?acc=GDS3990). The critical role of Gremlin1 in organoid formation and response to fibrotic insult will be tested using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Successful completion of this project will achieve a number of scientific objectives. The first is the development of a next generation cell culture organoid model of kidney injury and CKD. The development of 3D organoid models is a common direction of travel in many fields, as the limitations of studying individual cells in isolation are becoming increasingly evident. A major outcome from this proposal will be reduction potential under the NC3Rs framework. Given the numbers of mice used for CKD experiments each year (estimated at approximately 68,000 in 2016, Fig. 1), and the moderate/severe grading of many of these experiments, we believe there is exciting potential to reduce these numbers in the future. Another significant deliverable will be the use of human iPS cells to generate the kidney organoids, which will represent a translationally relevant model of human kidney disease. The potential to modify the ES cells at the gene level using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing will allow researchers to interrogate the role of their gene of interest not only in kidney development, but also in kidney cell responses to disease insults in a 3D organoid. We will use our networks such as the European Renal Cell Study Group (ERSCG) in the UK, Europe and the US to promote the potential of the organoid model as an alternative to rodent models of CKD.

Many institutions are developing CDC7 inhibitors (CDC7i), which block its enzymatic activity by competing with ATP, as potential agents for refractory p53 deficient cancers. Some CDC7i have excellent antitumor activity, especially in breast cancer models, and are approaching clinical trials. On the contrary, others compounds equally able to inhibit CDC7, only have marginal effect on DNA synthesis and proliferation. Such striking differences in cellular responses to CDC7 inhibition can be due to 1) off-target effects of siRNA and drugs 2) differences between protein depletion and inhibition of its kinase activity and 3) existence of mechanisms that can compensate for loss of CDC7 activity. Aims The overarching question is âHow do breast cancer cells respond to CDC7 kinase inhibition and what are the genetic determinants that affect response?â Specific objectives are: 1) Develop genetic cellular models that will unequivocally allow characterization of cellular phenotypes associated with rapid and specific inhibition of CDC7. 2) Identify cellular factors that modulate the response to CDC7i. Techniques and Methodology 1) Exploiting the concept of the âanalogue sensitive kinaseâ, we will generate cellular models in which CDC7 activity can be rapidly and efficiently modulated, with minimal off-target effects. This will be accomplished using CRISPR/CAS9 gene editing technology. 2) Using lentivirus sgRNA pooled libraries, we will perform large-scale loss-of function screens to identify cellular factors that increase the efficacy of CDC7i. Impact on breast cancer research This work will validate the use of CDC7i in breast cancer indicating which genes are involved in determining the sensitivity to CDC7i and it will advance understanding of cell-cycle regulation.

119	Dr Mullan Paul	Queen's University Belfast	2015-05-11	2018-11-01	Exploiting the TBX2 repression of CST6 as a novel treatment strategy for poor prognosis breast cancers.	TBX2 is an oncogenic transcription factor known to drive breast cancer proliferation. We have identified Cystatin 6 (CST6) as a consistently repressed TBX2 target. CST6 is a proposed tumour suppressor gene (TSG) and expression of CST6 in TBX2-expressing breast cancer cells induced apoptosis whilst non-tumorigenic breast cells remained unaffected. Functionally, CST6 is a protease inhibitor with extremely high affinity for the cancer-associated enzyme Legumain (LGMN). We have developed a series of small compound LGMN inhibitors (LGMNi's) which selectively kill TBX2/LGMN expressing breast cancer cell lines. Aims To define the TBX2 transcriptional repression complex To characterise TBX2/KAP1/HP1 epigenetic events in breast cancers To develop genetic screens of CST6 biology and LGMNi responses Techniques and Methodology Aim 1: Cell signalling methodologies (RqPCR, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, apoptosis/senescence assays, cell cycle analyses) will investigate the cellular effects of CST6 knockdown in non-tumorigenic cells. Lentiviral generation of CST6-promoter luciferase reporter cell lines and esiRNA screens will be used to identify epigenetic events occurring at the CST6 promoter. Aim 2: ChIP-seq for TBX2 and known interactors (HP1,KAP1) and DNA Methylation array analyses will be overlapped with a TBX2 microarray differential genelist to identify markers (e.g. CST6) co-ordinately regulated by this complex and pyrosequencing will validate candidate methylated genomic regions. Aim 3: Genome-wide screening using a CRISPR (GeCKO) library to look for (i) events promoting emergence of CST6-deficient breast cancers, and (ii) genes whose loss-of-function contributes to resistance to LGMNi's. Both screens will be validated in vitro (si/shRNA) and in vivo modelling (orthotopic implantation of luciferase-labelled lines) used to evaluate efficacy of LGMNi's using IVIS. Post mortem examination of mice will test utilities of selected PD biomarkers for LGMNi's. Impact on breast cancer research This proposal highlights a novel breast cancer pathway linked to poor outcomes which we will target with new anti-cancer (LGMNi) drugs.

121	Dr Bakal Chris	Institute of Cancer Research	2016-07-01	2022-06-30	Understanding how Rho GTP Exchange Factors regulate the cell shape changes underpinning breast cancer metastasis	Background Cancer metastasis is the cause of death for the vast majority of breast cancer patients. The metastatic spread of cancer cells throughout the body is absolutely dependent on the ability of cancer cells to change their shape â such as during tissue invasion, intravasation, and extravasation. Many of the cell shape changes that drive metastasis can be promoted by signals in the tumour microenvironment, including the stiffness of the tissue, and inflammation. Rho GTP Exchange Factors (RhoGEFs) are conserved regulators of cell shape that are activated by microenvironmental factors and play critical role in metastasis. In a series of previously performed genetic screens we have identified 14 RhoGEFs that we hypothesise promote the cell shape changes that underpin breast cancer metastasis in response to tissue stiffness and/or inflammation. The identification of these RhoGEFs opens up new avenues for the development of anti-metastatic therapeutics, but their role in regulating cell shape must be further characterised before they can be considered bona fide targets for manipulation in cancer cells. In particular, it is important to understand: if these RhoGEFs regulate cell shape in 3D environments with similar stiffness and geometry as tumour cells would encounter in vivo; which are the key downstream effectors of these RhoGEFs that mediate the effects of RhoGEF activation; how these RhoGEFs act to regulate downstream signalling dynamics to control cell shape; whether inhibition of these RhoGEFs affects metastasis in vivo. Aims and Methods: 1) Determine whether the 14 RhoGEFs we have identified in previous screens regulate cell shape and migration/invasion by using quantitative analysis of single cell shape following depletion of each RhoGEF in cells cultured in 3D collagen matrices of differing stiffness. 2) Identify the signalling effectors for all 14 RhoGEFs using novel computational analysis of in-house and publicly available datasets. 3) For selected RhoGEFs determine how these RhoGEFs regulate downstream signalling dynamics in single cells using novel quantitative reporters. 4) Validate whether the activity of selected RhoGEFs contributes to metastasis in vivo using CRISPR mediated knockdown in mouse models. We will also determine how RhoGEFs regulate downstream signalling activity in vivo. How the results of this research will be used: This work will describe the biochemical pathways that activated by RhoGEFs to regulate the morphogenesis, and thus provide the basis for the development of anti-metastatic therapies.

My 2018 publications in European Heart Journal and Circulation Research showed HCM could be phenocopied by a set of 11 isogenic CRISPR/Cas9 variants of the MYH7 gene (beta myosin heavy chain) of human pluripotent stem cell-cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs). Twelve different phenotyping methods were used to interrogate the generated human cell lines, often showing contradictory results relative to animal models. Importantly, a cohort of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) potentially linked to HCM was identified by RNA sequencing. This collection of cell resources, underpinning technologies and putative lncRNA pathway controllers form the basis of this proposal. Hypothesis and plans: I hypothesise that unveiling the function of these novel lncRNAs will provide new mechanisms and drug targets for HCM. To test this hypothesis, I propose to modulate the expression of these lncRNAs in hPSC-CMs by harnessing the dead Cas9 technology. I will then assess the phenotype of up/down-regulating these lncRNAs in the context of HCM, by employing the methodologies previously developed (molecular and functional assays). This will enable determining the role of lncRNAs in HCM - either as disease-causing or cardioprotective per se, or as gene modifiers regulating the primary disease effects caused by the structural defect. Finally, prediction and validation of lncRNA-interacting proteins by coupling in silico tools with molecular biology methods will result in the identification of new pathways involved in HCM, shedding light into the development of future drug treatments. If replacement of 50% of animals for HCM research could be achieved by further validating the human model, this will equate to sparing of 2100-5000 animals (of all species) in severe procedures in the next 10 years.

Summary: The cardiac sarcomere is a multi-protein complex essential to cardiac contractile function. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) are caused by pathogenic variants (PV) in sarcomere protein genes. Variants in genes directly involved in cellular contractility MYH7 (&beta;-myosin heavy chain), MYH6 (&alpha;-myosin heavy chain), and MYBPC3 (Myosin binding protein C) are either known or hypothesised to cause disease. Previous analyses of the mechanisms by which variants cause disease have relied on rodent models and extrapolation from clinical data. The introduction of clinically defined mutations into human iPSC-CMs using CRISPR/Cas-9 would allow the interrogation of these cellular phenotypes in a human background using molecular and mechanical strategies, adding clarity to the uncertainties of variant-phenotype relationships in these genes. Key goals: i) Interrogation of the molecular and biophysical (contraction and relaxation) mechanisms by which PVs in MYH7, MYH6, and MYBPC3 cause either HCM or DCM. ii) Define the contractile mechanism of MYH6 and MYH7 PVs to establish if they mirror one another. iii) Investigate if high throughput functional analyses of iPSC-CMs can be used to test individual variants of unknown clinical significance (VUS) to discriminate between those that are disease causing versus âbenignâ.

Other typical OI features such as blue sclerae, dentinogenesis imperfecta and hearing loss are not consistently present. Homozygous mutations in TMEM38B gene encoding for a potassium channel (TRIC-B) are responsible for the disease. TRIC-B is present in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane of non excitable cells and allows the potassium ions to move from the cytosol to the ensoplasmic reticulum (ER), thus acting as positive charge exchanger required for the exit of positive calcium ions from the ER without altering the potential membrane. Calcium homeostasis is very important for cellular function. The exact molecular mechanism linking the loss of TRIC-B function to the skeletal phenotype in OI type XIV is still unknown. The aim of our research will be to develop and use in vitro and in vivo models to test the hypothesis that altered proliferation and differentiation caused by altered intracellular calcium concentration could be causing OI type XIV bone fragility. The TMEM38B gene will be knocked out by CRISPR/Cas9 genomic engineering tool in an immortalized human osteoblast line widely used as model for osteoblastogenesis investigation. Proliferation and differentiation will be evaluated in control and mutated cells. To confirm our in vitro data we plan to generate a zebrafish model for OI type XIV using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology to knock out tmem38b gene.

Traditionally HIPK2 has been considered a potential tumour suppressor, but recent studies suggest a novel oncogenic role for HIPK2. While the pathways involved in its tumour suppressor role are relatively well studied, the underlying mechanisms mediating the pro-oncogenic function(s) of HIPK2 remain unclear. We have already uncovered a link connecting HIPK2 with a mayor pathway involved in chemoresistance. Our hypothesis is that HIPK2 is a major factor controlling cancer cell fate, by inducing either cell death or cell survival, and it can promote chemoresistance by activating multiple pathways. Understanding the conditions that drive HIPK2 towards cell survival and the signalling pathways involved, could establish HIPK2 as a potential therapeutic/prognostic factor. Aims Aim 1. To identify and characterise pathways involved in HIPK2-mediated chemoresistance Aim 2. To determine what makes HIPK2 a pro-survival factor Aim 3. To define the potential clinical value of HIPK2 Methods - CRISPR/Cas9 to knock-out, knock-in mutations or tag endogenous genes. - SILAC and RNA-seq to identify pathways regulated by HIPK2. - CRISPR-based library screening to identify HIPK2-regulated pathways involved in chemoresistance. - Automated quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence analysis of HIPK2 in tumours and correlation with survival/response to treatment. How the results of this research will be used It will provide key insights into the mechanisms underlying tumour therapeutic responses, by characterising new pathways involved in chemoresistance that may reveal HIPK2 as a potential prognostic/therapeutic target.

131	Dr de la Vega Laureano	University of Berne	2015-10-01	2018-09-30	Quality control of gene expression: towards understanding mechanism and physiological role of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD)	The term âNonsense-Mediated mRNA Decayâ (NMD) was originally coined to describe a translation-dependent process that degrades mRNAs with truncated open reading frames (ORFs). By recognizing and degrading mRNAs with premature termination codons (PTCs), many of which arise by alternative splicing, NMD serves as a quality control of gene expression and protects the cell from accumulating C-terminally truncated proteins with potentially toxic functions. However, a more general role of NMD in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression emerged from transcriptome-wide mRNA profilings that identified many physiological (i.e. PTC-free) mRNAs as NMD targets, overall affecting the mRNA levels of 3 - 10% of all genes in yeast, Drosophila, and human cells. NMD is essential in vertebrates and an important modulator of genetic disease phenotypes in humans, since 30% of all known disease-causing mutations are predicted to trigger NMD.Over the past 10 years, our lab has contributed both to the dissection of the molecular mechanism of NMD as well as to a better understanding of the biological function of NMD in mammalian cells. With the projects proposed here, we aim at continuing our research along these two lines by using a combination of biochemical, molecular biology, cell biology and reverse genetics methods. We plan to generate several inducible pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines with mutations in various NMD factors and assess their effect on the transcriptome and the capability of the cells to differentiate. The mutations will be introduced using recently developed genome-editing techniques (CRISPR/Cas). Compared to traditional knockdown-rescue experiments, the genome editing approach has the advantage that the effect of the mutant proteins can be assessed in the absence of any remaining low levels of WT protein possibly confounding the phenotype. On the biochemical side, one of our main goals is to establish a protocol to purify specific messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) populations that have been arrested at different stages along the NMD pathway and characterizing their composition by mass spectrometry. This will give us important insight into mRNP remodeling events during NMD. A third line of research concerns a follow-up of our recent finding that NMD appears to play a role in defending cells from RNA virus replication. We want to find out what makes the Semliki Forest Virus genomic RNA an NMD substrate and test other viruses for their sensitivity to NMD.Collectively, our research aims at understanding the molecular mechanism of NMD and its physiological role in human cells. This is the basis for the future development of highly specific approaches to manipulate in a controlled way NMD activity in different disease contexts.

132	Ao. Prof. Dr. MARTENS Sascha	University of Vienna	2015-06-01	2018-05-31	On the role of the Atg11 homology domain during selective autophagy	Autophagy is an intracellular process that mediates the bulk degradation of cellular material. During autophagy double membrane-bound vesicles called autophagosomes are formed de novo. Autophagosomes initially appear as small membrane structures called isolation membranes that gradually expand and thereby sequester cellular material. After their formation autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes (in complex eukaryotes) or the vacuole (in yeast) wherein the cargo is degraded. Autophagy thereby protects cells and thus the organism from various stresses including periods of starvation, protein aggregates, intracellular pathogens and damaged organelles. Consequently autophagy has been linked to various human diseases. It is becoming increasingly clear that autophagy can be highly selective with regard to the cargo that is captures within autophagosomes. Cargo receptor proteins specifically bind the cargo link it to the autophagic machinery via their interaction with scaffold proteins. In this proposal we will focus on the conserved Atg11-homology domain in the S. cerevisiae scaffold protein Atg11 and the human FIP200 protein. S. cerevisiae Atg11 interacts with the Atg19 cargo receptor and our preliminary results show that human FIP200 interacts with the p62 cargo receptor. Both interactions are mediated by the C-terminal Atg11 homology domain in the Atg11 and FIP200 scaffold proteins, respectively. Using biochemistry we will fine map these interactions and determine the structure of the Atg11-homology domain by X-ray crystallography. The biochemical and structural results will be tested in reconstitution systems employing cell lysates from CRISPR/Cas9 genome edited human cells and in assays for selective autophagy in S. cerevisiae and human cells lines. The experiments proposed here will yield fascinating insights into the coupling of selective autophagy cargo to the autophagic machinery. The cargo receptors and autophagic scaffold proteins are playing key roles and our experiments will help to unravel the mechanisms underlying this important process.

Yet, it has also unveiled that the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) hampers the efficiency of this therapeutic option and limits its success. The concept that metabolism is able to shape the immune response has gained general acceptance. Nonetheless, little is known on how the metabolic crosstalk between different tumor compartments contributes to the harsh TME and ultimately impairs T cell fitness within the tumor. This proposal aims to decipher which metabolic changes in the TME impede proper anti-tumor immunity. Starting from the meta-analysis of public human datasets, corroborated by metabolomics and transcriptomics data from several mouse tumors, we ranked clinically relevant and altered metabolic pathways that correlate with resistance to immunotherapy. Using a CRISPR/Cas9 platform for their functional in vivo selection, we want to identify cancer cell intrinsic metabolic mediators and, indirectly, distinguish those belonging specifically to the stroma. By means of genetic tools and small molecules, we will modify promising metabolic pathways in cancer cells and stromal cells (particularly in tumor-associated macrophages) to harness tumor immunosuppression. In a mirroring approach, we will apply a similar screening tool on cytotoxic T cells to identify metabolic targets that enhance their fitness under adverse growth conditions. This will allow us to manipulate T cells ex vivo and to therapeutically intervene via adoptive T cell transfer. By analyzing the metabolic network and crosstalk within the tumor, this project will shed light on how metabolism contributes to the immunosuppressive TME and T cell maladaptation. The overall goal is to identify druggable metabolic targets that i) reinforce the intrinsic anti-tumor immune response by breaking immunosuppression and ii) promote T cell function in immunotherapeutic settings by rewiring either the TME or the T cell itself.

Lengthening or shortening of the cell cycle is a fundamental disease mechanism in development, ageing and cancer. It is likely that many developmental diseases are caused at least in large part by early defects of cell proliferation and many studies are now using mouse models of these conditions to explore this hypothesis in numerous systems. Mouse cell cycle kinetics are often investigated using thymidine analogues such as BrdU - incorporated into DNA during S-phase. These techniques rely on multiple injections or the surgical implantation of mini osmotic pumps to deliver the analogue. Recently, genetically encoded cell cycle probes have been developed and these are key to refining proliferation assays because they can be combined with live-imaging efficiently generating large datasets from fewer animals. Of these, the best existing model is the R26Fucci2aR (developed by RLM) reporter model because of the 1:1 stoichiometry of probe expression and the ability to control expression spatio-temporally with Cre-recombinase. However a number of shortcomings still exist: 1) It does not discriminate S-phase from G2/M-phases; 2) It does not discriminate G1 from quiescent cells in G0. 3) The probes are technically difficult to detect with antibodies limiting them to live studies. In order to address these shortcomings we will develop a next generation Quiescence and Cell Cycle Indicator (QuCCI) and Rosa26 QuCCi knock-in reporter mouse. QuCCi incorporates the the tried and tested probes p27K-,hCdt1(Cy-) and hGem(1/110) fused to mCerulean, mCherry and mVenus respectively including unique epitope tags. QuCCi can discriminate between cells in G1, S, G2/M and G0. The PhD student will join an existing team across Lancaster University (UK), Edinburgh University (UK) and McGill University (Canada) who have already committed time and resources to the development of the model. The team that we have assembled to support the studentship is perfectly placed to facilitate the project because we have extensive experience and proven track records in developing multicistronic constructs and cell lines (Dr. Mort, Dr. Ford), generating transgenic mice using CRISPR/Cas9 technology including the insertion of large constructs using injection into two-cell embryos (Dr. Yamanaka, Dr. Cowan) and in performing image analysis and quantitative imaging techniques (Dr. Mort, Prof. OâShea).

Advances in targeted hormonal therapy (second generation anti-androgens) have led to more effective management of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Despite these highly potent drugs, disease recurs with new genomic and epigenetic alterations. In this ERC proposal, I will leverage my expertise in cancer genomics and a new computational methodology to unravel the landscape of lethal PCA, with a focus on determining the Achilles' heel of these aggressive tumours. In Aim 1, I will take advantage of DNA sequencing data from over 1000 patient-derived tumour samples and use highly innovative mathematical algorithms to create a detailed evolution chart for each tumour and identify driver events leading to CRPC. After nominating candidate drivers, we propose testing 10 using in vitro gain- and loss-of-function validations experiments (i. e. , CRISPR/Cas9, shRNA, and Tet-On assays) in PCA cell lines using migration, invasion, and cell cycle as readouts. In Aim 2, I will focus on genomic events that occur in recalcitrant CRPC, positing that genetic alterations occurring prior or secondary to treatment harbour clues into resistance. In vitro validations will be performed on the top 10 biomarkers. In Aim 3, I will nominate synthetic lethality combinations by mining CRPC genomic data taken from Stand Up 2 Cancer CRPC clinical trials. I will prioritize mutually exclusive genomic alterations in genes for which approved drugs exist. The top 5-10 candidates will be validated in a prostate lineage-specific manner. In summary, this ERC proposal will leverage my many years of expertise in PCA genomics and emerging public and private CRPC datasets to uncover driver mutations that will enhance our understanding of recalcitrant CRPC. Successful completion of this study should lead to novel treatment approaches for CRPC and to a computational model that may transform our approach to evaluating other cancers.

140	Dr. Westra Edze	University of Exeter	2017-01-01	2021-12-31	The evolutionary ecology of bacterial immune mechanisms	Bacteria have a range of immune mechanisms, but it is unclear why this diverse armamentarium evolved. The most important immune mechanisms are (1) Surface Modification (SM) (2) Abortive infection (Abi) (3) Restriction Modification (R-M) (4) CRISPR-Cas and (5) prokaryotic Argonaute (pAgo), all of which can occur as stand-alone mechanisms or in combination. The individual mechanisms differ in key aspects, such as their fitness costs (constitutive versus inducible), specificity (indiscriminate versus specific), the recipient of the benefits (individual versus group), the speed of de novo resistance evolution (rapid versus slow), and heritability of immunity. Here I will take a combined in vitro and in vivo approach to tease apart the variables that drive the evolution of these diverse stand-alone and integrated bacterial immune strategies in nature, and examine their associated co-evolutionary dynamics. I focus on three ecological variables that are consistently important in host-symbiont co-evolution: (1) force of infection (2) spatial structure (3) presence of mutualists (plasmids). First, I will perform in vitro manipulations using Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 variants that carry either single or multiple immune mechanisms. Next, I will sequence metagenomes, transcriptomes and viromes of microbial communities from environments that differ in ecological variables that are important in vitro, to examine their importance in vivo. Key ecological mechanisms identified in the first two parts of the project will be used to guide mesocosm experiments to experimentally confirm that these mechanisms are the drivers of the observed patterns of resistance and co-evolution in nature. Finally, I will share my data with mathematical biologists to generate theoretical models to predict and manipulate the evolution of bacterial immune mechanisms, which will facilitate tailored species protection in agriculture and industry.

This proposal is based on a new in vivo system that I have established to study axonal transport of organelles in wing sensory neurons of Drosophila melanogaster. This system allows, for the first time, organelle transport to be studied in intact adult neurons of living Drosophila over time. Longitudinal studies in this system have revealed a remarkable age-dependent decline in mitochondrial transport. My previous data suggest that experimental upregulation of mitochondrial motility delays age-associated protein aggregation and increases neuronal healthspan. I also found compelling evidence that an evolutionarily conserved signalling pathway can regulate mitochondrial transport in axons of ageing neurons. I propose to exploit this innovative imaging assay to understand the molecular mechanisms linking this specific signalling cascade to mitochondria transport and neuronal ageing. Initially, I will undertake a biochemical characterisation of this signalling pathway in Drosophila, including the identification of downstream targets that regulate transport. By using CRISPR genome engineering and tissue specific RNAi,I will attempt to identify the key regulatory nodes of the pathway. This will be followed by phenotypic analysis of neuronal function. After the Drosophila work, I will test the relevance of our findings in mammalian neurons. These experiments will be performed in cultured mouse motor neurons derived from embryonic stem cells in which mitochondria will be fluorescently labeled with a commercial dye. Finally, I will explore whether chemical activation of the pathway is sufficient to increase mitochondrial trafficking in single neurons of mouse sciatic nerve in vivo. To achieve this, I will use an available transgenic mouse strain, known as MitoMouse, which expresses a fluorescent marker of mitochondria in neurons. In these experiments,mitochondrial transport in young and old mice will be compared before and after challenging the neurons with pathway agonists.

My proposed research aims to advance our understanding of the mechanisms of cell competition and how it impacts on adult tissue biology, to advance our fundamental understanding of this biomedically-relevant process and learn how to harness it for therapeutics. Building on my groupâs recent discoveries and methodological advances, I will use an integrated strategy combining in vitro and in vivo approaches to: 1) Elucidate how the oxidative stress response, which we found marks cells as âlosersâ for competitive elimination, triggers cell competition in Drosophila. 2) Elucidate another link we discovered between aberrant autophagy in âloserâ cells and cell competition, in Drosophila. 3) Characterize the molecular mechanisms behind our discovery of p53-induced cell competition, using a CRISPR-based genomic screen in mammalian cultured cells. 4) Investigate the impact of cell competition on human adult tissue biology, using human primary keratinocytes and p53 competition-inducing mutations. 5) Carry out targeted proof-of-principle experiments to investigate for the first time whether cell competition can be exploited to improve tissue engraftment and repopulation in vivo, using the mouse airway.

144	Professor Vormoor Josef	Newcastle University	2017-01-01	2021-12-31	Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia - targeting novel mechanisms of clonal survival and expansion	Background: Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy in children and adolescents and, despite its high cure rate, remains one of the major causes of cancer-related and overall childhood deaths. Moreover, 2 â 3 years of chemotherapy are associated with significant morbidity and rare but potentially life-changing long-term toxicity, necessitating the need for more effective and less toxic therapies. Aims: The vision for this programme is to develop rationally designed, small molecule-based combination therapies for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: combinations that are highly active, non-toxic and prevent the emergence of resistant subclones. Methods: These combinations will be based on: â¢ Targeted therapies that we are currently taking into early phase clinical trials in children with relapsed ALL (e.g. MEK and BCL2 inhibition) â¢ Hypotheses-driven approaches (e.g. reactivation of p53, a key mediator of negative selection in normal B cell development) â¢ Functional CRISPR screens in patient-derived cells to identify synthetic vulnerabilities in the context of exposure to targeted therapies â¢ The identification of therapeutic targets through genome-wide CRISPR screens and the analysis of leukaemia-specific gene splicing Genome-wide CRISPR screening in the context of targeted therapies offers a step change in our ability to interrogate pathway dependencies and to select the most suitable inhibitors for effective combination therapies. Unbiased CRISPR screening in patient-derived cells and the analysis of plant homeodomain finger protein 5A (PHF5A)-mediated RNA splicing will determine the key drivers of the malignant phenotype in ALL. Our screens will identify opportunities for repurposing drugs already in clinical development and provide new targets for drug discovery. Most importantly, they will inform the translational/preclinical component of our programme in which we will test novel combination therapies using patient-derived cells in clinically relevant ex vivo and in vivo models. How the results of this research will be used: Our programme will generate robust preclinical data for novel combination therapies, based on mechanistic hypotheses and unbiased screening approaches, as the basis for innovative early phase clinical trials.

Researchers have used mice and rats to model kidney damage seen in human patients with diabetes, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, lupus and fibrosis injury. Although many useful gene and protein targets have emerged from these studies, rodent models are limited for a number of reasons. One is the ethical issues around the numbers of mice in particular that are needed to generate gene knockouts, particularly tissue-specific knockouts (usually in the 100s-1000s). A second limitation is the fact that mice and rat models do not faithfully recapitulate the disease phenotype seen in the human kidney. For example, the most commonly used genetic strain of mice, C57Bl/6, are resistant to diabetes-induced kidney damage. Many gene and proteins that have been identified in rodent models have failed to materialise as bona fide targets when tested in humans. These limitations have led to a growing frustration in academia and industry, and led to the drive to improve our models of CKD. We propose to establish a new model of kidney injury based on 3D organoids derived from human iPS cells. Our protocol of differentiation triggers the formation of both glomerular and tubular epithelial cells that form themselves into glomerular-like and tubule-like structures (Fig. 2). These organoids will form the basis of the three interrelated project aims, which will use cell biology, microscopy and single cell sequencing to interrogate the genetic profile of the kidney organoid cells (Aim 1). We will then establish a range of new models of CKD exposing organoids to high glucose and other important drivers of kidney disease to induce damage. Cutting-edge single cell sequencing using the 10 x Genomics platform (https://www.10xgenomics.com) will be applied in-house to interrogate the genetic profiles of each of the different kidney-like cells in 3D organoids in normal versus disease conditions. The sequencing data obtained from the various organoid damage models will then be compared to existing datasets from previously used rodent models of disease available on the GEO bioinformatics platform (e.g. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/GDSbrowser?acc=GDS3990). The critical role of Gremlin1 in organoid formation and response to fibrotic insult will be tested using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Successful completion of this project will achieve a number of scientific objectives. The first is the development of a next generation cell culture organoid model of kidney injury and CKD. The development of 3D organoid models is a common direction of travel in many fields, as the limitations of studying individual cells in isolation are becoming increasingly evident. A major outcome from this proposal will be reduction potential under the NC3Rs framework. Given the numbers of mice used for CKD experiments each year (estimated at approximately 68,000 in 2016, Fig. 1), and the moderate/severe grading of many of these experiments, we believe there is exciting potential to reduce these numbers in the future. Another significant deliverable will be the use of human iPS cells to generate the kidney organoids, which will represent a translationally relevant model of human kidney disease. The potential to modify the ES cells at the gene level using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing will allow researchers to interrogate the role of their gene of interest not only in kidney development, but also in kidney cell responses to disease insults in a 3D organoid. We will use our networks such as the European Renal Cell Study Group (ERSCG) in the UK, Europe and the US to promote the potential of the organoid model as an alternative to rodent models of CKD. Dissemination of our results at national meetings such as the UK Kidney Week and the American Society of Nephrology will maximise the potential of widespread uptake and create exciting added value for the project.

In particular, mirroring their unparalleled morphological and cellular complexity, vertebrate brains show the highest levels of regulated AS known in nature. However, the functions of most of these alternative transcripts, and the evolutionary impact that the increased transcriptional complexity has had on the evolution of the vertebrate brain are still widely unexplored. In this project, we will investigate the functions and evolutionary impact of neural AS in vertebrates. We will focus on neural-specific alternative exons that are highly conserved across vertebrate groups (suggesting functional importance), but that are not conserved in invertebrates, and are thus vertebrate-specific genomic novelties. We will term these exons Vertebrate- and Neural-specific Alternatively Spliced (VN-AS) exons. Through a combination of bioinformatics, experimental manipulation in models species, and systems-level network analysis, we aim to: (i) Comprehensively identify VN-AS exons, and study their regulation during vertebrate neurogenesis and nervous system development, using RNA-seq and comparative genomics; (ii) Probe the phenotypic impact of VN-AS exons on vertebrate nervous systems, using the CRISPR-Cas technology for genome editing; and (iii) Investigate how VN-AS exons rewire protein-protein interaction networks in vertebrate neurons - an emergent molecular function for AS -, and whether this rewiring underlies novel functions of VN-AS exons in the vertebrate brains. This project will thus deliver fundamental insight into two major unanswered questions: (i) what are the functions of transcriptomic diversification, and (ii) how does transcriptomic diversification impact organismal evolution. Our results will fill a large gap of knowledge in our current understanding of brain evolution and development, providing a complementary angle to traditional gene expression studies.

147	Professor Santocanale Corrado	National University Of Ireland, Galway	2016-02-01	2019-01-31	Cellular responses to ATP competitive CDC7 kinase inhibitors	CDC7 kinase is considered a key switch for DNA replication and its depletion by siRNA causes cancer cells to stop DNA synthesis and to die in a p53 independent manner. Many institutions are developing CDC7 inhibitors (CDC7i), which block its enzymatic activity by competing with ATP, as potential agents for refractory p53 deficient cancers. Some CDC7i have excellent antitumor activity, especially in breast cancer models, and are approaching clinical trials. On the contrary, others compounds equally able to inhibit CDC7, only have marginal effect on DNA synthesis and proliferation. Such striking differences in cellular responses to CDC7 inhibition can be due to 1) off-target effects of siRNA and drugs 2) differences between protein depletion and inhibition of its kinase activity and 3) existence of mechanisms that can compensate for loss of CDC7 activity. Aims The overarching question is âHow do breast cancer cells respond to CDC7 kinase inhibition and what are the genetic determinants that affect response?â Specific objectives are: 1) Develop genetic cellular models that will unequivocally allow characterization of cellular phenotypes associated with rapid and specific inhibition of CDC7. 2) Identify cellular factors that modulate the response to CDC7i. Techniques and Methodology 1) Exploiting the concept of the âanalogue sensitive kinaseâ, we will generate cellular models in which CDC7 activity can be rapidly and efficiently modulated, with minimal off-target effects. This will be accomplished using CRISPR/CAS9 gene editing technology. 2) Using lentivirus sgRNA pooled libraries, we will perform large-scale loss-of function screens to identify cellular factors that increase the efficacy of CDC7i. Impact on breast cancer research This work will validate the use of CDC7i in breast cancer indicating which genes are involved in determining the sensitivity to CDC7i and it will advance understanding of cell-cycle regulation.

TBX2 is an oncogenic transcription factor known to drive breast cancer proliferation. We have identified Cystatin 6 (CST6) as a consistently repressed TBX2 target. CST6 is a proposed tumour suppressor gene (TSG) and expression of CST6 in TBX2-expressing breast cancer cells induced apoptosis whilst non-tumorigenic breast cells remained unaffected. Functionally, CST6 is a protease inhibitor with extremely high affinity for the cancer-associated enzyme Legumain (LGMN). We have developed a series of small compound LGMN inhibitors (LGMNi's) which selectively kill TBX2/LGMN expressing breast cancer cell lines. Aims To define the TBX2 transcriptional repression complex To characterise TBX2/KAP1/HP1 epigenetic events in breast cancers To develop genetic screens of CST6 biology and LGMNi responses Techniques and Methodology Aim 1: Cell signalling methodologies (RqPCR, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, apoptosis/senescence assays, cell cycle analyses) will investigate the cellular effects of CST6 knockdown in non-tumorigenic cells. Lentiviral generation of CST6-promoter luciferase reporter cell lines and esiRNA screens will be used to identify epigenetic events occurring at the CST6 promoter. Aim 2: ChIP-seq for TBX2 and known interactors (HP1,KAP1) and DNA Methylation array analyses will be overlapped with a TBX2 microarray differential genelist to identify markers (e.g. CST6) co-ordinately regulated by this complex and pyrosequencing will validate candidate methylated genomic regions. Aim 3: Genome-wide screening using a CRISPR (GeCKO) library to look for (i) events promoting emergence of CST6-deficient breast cancers, and (ii) genes whose loss-of-function contributes to resistance to LGMNi's. Both screens will be validated in vitro (si/shRNA) and in vivo modelling (orthotopic implantation of luciferase-labelled lines) used to evaluate efficacy of LGMNi's using IVIS. Post mortem examination of mice will test utilities of selected PD biomarkers for LGMNi's.

151	Dr Coutts Amanda	Nottingham Trent University	2017-05-19	2019-05-19	The role of autophagy in cancer cell motility	This project will investigate the role of autophagy in cell motility taking advantage of novel prostate cancer cell lines that mimic stages of disease progression (including EMT and metastasis) available through my collaborators at NTU. In particular it will address the role of the actin nucleator JMY, a p53 co-factor that impacts of autophagosome formation, cell motility and survival in autophagy-mediated effects on cell survival and the role of actin nucleation. Specific goals during the duration of the funding: -assess autophagy levels (both basal and induced) in cancer cells lines and correlate with cell motility and invasion (also assessing cell survival and adhesion/motility events, using impedance measurements, to distinguish between effects on proliferation vs motility). -Assess impact of JMY on autophagy-mediated motility (using specific mutants to distinguish autophagosome targeted vs not, and Arp2/3-independent vs dependent actin nucleation. -Assess impact of modulating autophagy levels on cell motility (i.e., through siRNA/CRISPR-Cas9 targetting of JMY and autophagy initiator proteins and small molecule inhibitors of various stages in autophagosome formation).

In skin and lung cancers, they often result from exposure to environmental mutagens such as cigarette smoke or UV light; however, in other cancers, their causes remain unexplained. Restoration of DNA-repair in mice with BRCA1-deficiency prevents tumour formation revealing that defective DNA-repair contributes to cancer. The Alternative-Non-Homologous-End-Joining (A-EJ) pathway has recently been discovered and shown to promote genome instability and therapy resistance in BRCA1-deficient cancers but only few components of A-EJ pathway are known. In addition the causes of their activation remain elusive. Inhibition of A-EJ could be an effective therapy for cancers associated with DNA repair deficiency. In pump-priming experiments that will establish proof of concept for my new laboratory in the UK, I will develop novel quantitative laboratory assay for A-EJ employing cutting-edge CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, high-throughput sequencing and machine learning algorithm. My long-term goal is to elucidate A-EJ regulation, to identify new members of the A-EJ pathway and to define its mutational footprints that will serve as a biomarker of DNA repair deficiency. The outcomes of this seed funding will enable me to secure long-term funding to study A-EJ in cancer and its potential in cancer stratification and personalized therapy.

The disease is marked by the presence of extracellular plaques - composed of aggregated amyloid-Ã peptide (AÃ) - and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) - consisting of aggregates of abnormally hyperphosphorylated Tau protein. Recent studies showed that AÃ and abnormal Tau protein may interact and have synergistic toxic effects, leading to neuronal death in AD, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Although Tau was primarily described as an axonal protein stabilizing microtubule function and assembly, new findings obtained in the laboratory of Professor JÃ¼rgen GÃ¶tz at the University of Queensland (Australia) identified a dendritic function of this protein that seems to be crucial in mediating AÃ toxicity at the postsynaptic compartment. Indeed, Tau is required for the targeting of FYN, a Src kinase widely expressed in the hippocampus, to dendritic spines. FYN phosphorylates the GluN2B subunit of the NMDA receptor, which is essential for recruiting the postsynaptic density (95kD) protein (PSD95). This enhances the stability of the receptor complex at the synaptic membrane, which boosts the excitotoxic signaling induced by the presence of AÃ. Interestingly, in absence of Tau, the targeting/clustering of FYN is massively reduced in the dendritic spines and, vice versa, when tau is pseudo-phosphorylated at distinct phosphorylation sites (AT180 - 12E8 - PHF1 - S396/S404), targeting of Tau and FYN to spines is markedly increased. Together, this identifies a cross-talk between the two molecules which we intend to further dissect in the present proposal.HYPOTHESIS: Thus, based on the previous and preliminary data obtained in the laboratory of Prof. GÃ¶tz, the overarching hypothesis of the project is that the subcellular localization, trafficking and clustering of FYN and Tau are tightly regulated in a physiological and pathological context (AD).AIMS: The specific aims of the present study are to prove our hypothesis and to enhance our understanding of the endogenous regulation of Tau and FYN trafficking to the dendritic spine. For this approach, a combination of technics (biochemical, pharmacological as well as super-resolution microscopy) established in the GÃ¶tz laboratory, will be used to identify the mechanisms underlying the targeting of Tau and FYN at the spine, under physiological and pathological (AD) conditions. Especially, we will use novel gene-edited mouse strains created in the GÃ¶tz laboratory with the TALEN / CRISPR technology, introducing a photo-convertible mEOS2 tag in-frame into the carboxy-terminus of either the Tau-encoding gene or the FYN-encoding gene. The fluorescence emitted by Tau-mEOS2 and FYN-mEOS2 will be analyzed using super resolution microscopy technics, including the single particle tracking photo-activated localization microscopy (sptPALM).Using these tools, we would like to pursue two main objectives as part of this program:Specific Aim 1: To determine the mobility of FYN and Tau in the somato-dendritic domain and spines: i) under physiological conditions; ii) after neuronal activation and; iii) in the presence of AÃ.Specific Aim 2: To determine whether Tau controls FYN clustering (i.e. the formation of nanoclusters).IMPACT: The current approach opens the opportunity to dissect a novel fundamental mechanism and identifies how the two key molecules in AD, AÃ and Tau, interact via FYN to exert their toxic effects. It uses state-of-the-art technology and has ramifications for additional neurodegenerative diseases with protein aggregation, as well as for the role Tau and FYN have in a physiological context and the identification of new therapeutic targets for the treatment of AD.

By contrast, some lower vertebrates, such as zebrafish, can perfectly reconstruct their damaged organs, such as appendages, heart, retina and spinal cord. Little is known about biological factors that permit or suppress the natural ability of organ regeneration. Our goal is to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms that generate new cells for fin and heart regeneration in zebrafish. We will focus on dedifferentiation processes that transform mature cells at the site of injury into a progenitor cell pool, called the blastema. An understanding of blastema formation and regulation both in the fin and heart will elucidate common principles of the regenerative machinery. On the other hand, we will investigate the factors stimulating cardiac cell proliferation and transient scar deposition after heart infarction. This undertaking will demand the use of existing methods, as well as developing novel research tools in adult zebrafish, such as the inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system technology. A conceptual and molecular deciphering of mechanisms of natural regeneration in lower vertebrates will help to build a foundation for regenerative medicine.

The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene is a major oncogene in NB, and ALK activating mutations or wild-type (wt) expression are associated with poor clinical outcome. The implication of ALK-wt, and the ALK activating mutations, ALK-F1174L, and ALK-R1275Q, in NC progenitor fate and neuroblastomagenesis was previously investigated using immortalized murine neural crest progenitor cells (NCPC), MONC-1 and JoMa-1. In vivo studies by orthotopic (adrenal gland) implantations reveled that MONC-1 cells could generate various tumor types, such as NB, osteo/chondrosarcoma, and undifferentiated tumors. In contrast, MONC-1 cells expressing ALK-F1174L only produced highly aggressive undifferentiated NC cell-derived tumors, similarly to JoMa1 cells overexpressing ALK-wt, or activating ALK mutants. JoMa1-ALK-derived tumors expressed high levels of various stem cells (SC) and NC stem cell (NCSC) associated markers, confirming their stem-like and phenotypes, and suggesting an ALK-mediated impairment of NCPC differentiation potential in vivo.The specific objectives of the present project are to investigate the functional role of ALK and its downstream pathways in the control of NCPC differentiation potential and fate, as well as to elucidate the involvement of activated ALK in the maturation of the sympathoadrenal lineage and in NB differentiation. Using ALK-transduced NCPC cell lines described above in combination with specific ALK and ALK signaling pathways inhibitors, we will investigate the influence of activated ALK signaling on NCPC differentiation capacity and fate in vitro. To increase our knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms and transcriptional controllers involved in ALK-mediated blockage of NCPC differentiation in vivo, we plan to investigate the global epigenetic patterns and the expression profiles associated to NB orthotopic tumors-derived from MONC1 cells as compared to undifferentiated tumors-derived from MONC-1-ALK-F cells. The role of putative ALK target genes, Myc and Twist1/2, or of newly identified key transcriptional regulators in the control of NCPC differentiation will be explored by means of specific inhibitors and/or silencing strategies through CRISPR/Cas9. In addition, a special focus will be dedicated to the involvement of ALK deregulated activation in the differentiation and maturation of normal sympathetic neurons and adrenal chromaffin cells, using ALK-mutants knock-in mice, as well as in NB cell differentiation potential using ALK overexpressing NB cell lines. Moreover, clinical NB samples will be examined to identify a possible correlation between ALK expression level and/or localization, and neublastic cell differentiation status within individual tumors.This project will be performed within an established collaborative international team of experts in NC development (Prof. L. Sommer and Dr O. Shakhova), in the molecular genetics of NB (Drs I. Janoueix-Lerosey and G. Schleiermacher), in NB orthotopic modeling (Dr J.-M. Joseph), in NB histopathology (Dr M. Peuchmaur), and in epigenetic regulation of solid tumors (Dr N. Riggi). This study should provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms responsible for dysfunctional NC cell maturation responsible for NB development, and may contribute to the identification of new therapeutic options.

156	Dr Batada Nizar	University of Zurich	2015-06-01	2018-05-31	Role of Scavenger Receptor BI and Endothelial Lipase in the Transendothelial Transport of High Density Lipoproteins	Background: High density lipoproteins (HDL) and their main protein constituent and precursor, apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), exert several atheroprotective actions within the vascular wall, notably the removal of cholesterol from macrophage foam cells for reverse transport to the liver. However, it is little understood how HDL and apoA-I pass the endothelial barriers to reach and leave the arterial intima with the lipid laden macrophages. We have previously found that aortic endothelial cells bind, internalize and resecrete apoA-I and HDL by processes that are modulated by the ATP binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1, respectively, as well as the scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI), endothelial lipase (EL), and the ectopic F0F1-ATPase/P2Y12 axis. We have not yet unravelled the mechanisms by which these proteins contribute to endothelial transcytosis of HDL. For this proposal we will focus on the role of SR-BI and EL.Working hypothesis: SR-BI and EL are HDL binding proteins that mediate the internalization of HDL either directly as an endocytic receptor (notably the SR-BII splice variant of SCARB1) or indirectly by transducing signals to an endocytic machinery (SR-BI via its PDZ or cholesterol sensing domains) or generating signaling molecules (EL by generating lysophosphatidylcholines or exposing S1P). Specific aims: In two subprojects we want to answer the following two questions: 1. How do SR-BI and EL regulate the internalization and trafficking of HDL through endothelial cells? 2. Do EL and SR-BI modulate transendothelial transport of HDL in vivo? Experimental design: For amswering the first question we will generate human aortic and lymphatic endothelial cell lines (HAEC and HLEC) with knock-outs of the SCARB1 and LIPG genes using the CRISPR/Cas system. The SCARB1 ko cell line will be knocked-in with either of the two isoforms SR-BI or SR-BII or with two SR-BI mutants which lack the signaling PDZ domain or the cholesterol sensing activity. The LIPG1 ko cells will be knocked-in with either wild type EL or an enzymatically inactive EL mutant. After confirming the endothelial phenotype the individual cell lines as well as the effective knock-outs and knock-ins, the cells will be analyzed for their function to bind, internalize and transport HDL per se and after complementation with signaling molecules (EL knock-out and knock-in cell lines). These biochemical experiments will be complemented by fluorescence microscopy studies to unravel any erroneous trafficking of HDL. The cells will also be characterized for other responses to HDL, notably in nitric oxide production, VCAM-1 expression, apoptosis, endothelial repair, and phosphorylation of signaling molecules. The second question will be approached by comparing the kinetics of radiocatively labeled HDL and control proteins in SCARB1 ko mice, LIPG ko mice and wild type mice. We will inject radioiodinated HDL, albumin or LDL into the tail vein to monitor its appearance in the arterial wall and peritoneal cave as well as into the peritoneal cave or foot pads to monitor its appearance in plasma. We will also use two photon live microscopy to study the kinetics by which fluorescence labeled HDL and control proteins injected intravenously and subcutaneously appear in the interstial space and microvessels of the skin, respectively. Expected value: Our project will answer a key question on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, namely how HDL particles enter and leave the vascular wall. This process is a pre-requisite for the mediation of anti-atherogenic functions of HDL and therefore a potential target for anti-atherosclerotic drug therapy.

One type of chronic pain, neuropathic pain, is expected to affect more than 75 million of people worldwide. Neuropathic pain (NP) as defined by the IASP is a âPain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous systemâ. This clinical syndrome may appear in the context of many different alterations of the peripheral and central nervous system; from radiculopathy induced by disk hernia, traumatic or compressive (tumors) nerve injuries, toxic, metabolic or infectious conditions (chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, AIDS-related pain, and so on) to multiple sclerosis, stroke or Parkinson disease. Neuropathic pain is associated with hyperexcitability of the central and the peripheral nervous systems, resulting in ongoing pain, allodynia (innocuous stimuli that become painful), hyperalgesia (exaggerated and prolonged pain response in response to noxious stimuli) and negative symptoms such as hypoalgesia. Increased neuronal activity can explain both spontaneous and exaggerated stimulus-evoked pain. In the nervous system, the excitability is mainly carried by voltage-gated sodium channels (Navs) that are responsible for the upstroke of action potentials. Navs are heteromeric glycosylated protein composed of a large pore-forming a-subunit and small Ã-auxiliary subunits. Nine genes encode for distinct channel isoforms (Nav1.1 to Nav1.9) and all, except Nav1.4 and Nav1.5, are expressed in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) nociceptive neurons. In these neurons, Nav1.7 has been found to be the most expressed TTX-sensitive isoform compared to Nav1.1, Nav1.2, Nav1.3 and Nav1.6, and is coexpressed with the two TTX resistant isoforms, Nav1.8 and Nav1.9.In neuropathic pain, accumulation of Nav1.7, Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 was reported in the primary afference. In addition to this acquired pain syndrome, the contribution of Nav1.7 in inherited pain disorders has been recurrently reported. Congenital insensitivity to pain due to loss-of-function of the channel were first described in 2006 and since then other mutations have been reported. On the other side of the spectrum, multiple gain-of-functions mutations were shown to be associated with two exaggerated pain sensitivity pathologies, namely inherited erythromyelagia (IEM) and paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (PEPD). More recently, studies also highlighted a role for Nav1.7 in idiopathic small-fiber neuropathy (I-SFN); nearly 30% of patients suffering from this pathology presented a gain-of function mutation in Nav1.7. Small fiber peripheral neuropathy is a type of peripheral neuropathy that occurs from damage to C-fibers and A-d fibers that are the small unmyelinated and thinly myelinated peripheral nerve fibers belonging to nociceptive neurons. Since then, similar gain-of-function mutations in Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 have also been reported. I-SFN is not only accompanied with neuronal hyperexcitability but is also associated with axonal degeneration and neuronal death. Now what is hypothesized, but remains to be demonstrated is whether the hyperexcitability is responsible for the axonal degeneration. In vitro experiments confirmed that 1) these mutations induced modification of the biophysical properties of the different Navs in cell expression system and 2) led to DRG neurons hyperexcitability. These two combined approaches however present limitations. HEK cells do not express endogenous Navs proteins and are thus widely used to characterize the effect of a mutation on a particular canal biophysical properties. However the modulation of activity of the channel might significantly vary between different cell types and HEK cells do not necessarily reflect DRG neurons. Another limitation of cell expression system is that HEK cells no not express potassium channel, consequently the effect of these mutations on the overall cellular excitability cannot be investigated under current clamp mode (recording of action potentials is not possible). To study the effect of mutation on cellular excitability, another approach using primary culture of mice nociceptive neurons transfected with human Nav1.7 containing the specific mutation is commonly used. The main limitation of this approach is that the mutated human cDNA is expressed together with the two wild-type mice alleles; thus there is an interspecies gene coexpression and a contamination of the mutated cDNA with the endogenous allele. Another approach to investigate these single mutations of Nav1.7/1.8/1.9 would be to generate knock-in mice harbouring these mutations. But generating such knock-in mice line with the traditional approach is laborious and time consuming and has consequently never been performed in the pain field. It is well-known that upon repetitive stimulation of the primary afference, the input into the central nervous system will be potentiated. The synaptic strength between primary and secondary order neuron is increased, ultimately leading to the hyperexcitability of the dorsal horn nociceptive neurons. This process is referred to as central sensitization, a mechanism first described by Clifford Woolf, and that has been extensively studied since then. Nothing is known on the effect of the gain-of-function mutations of Nav1.7 on mechanisms of central sensitization. It is likely that the increased excitability observed in the periphery will also lead to a strengthening of the spinal cord input.AIMBecause the use of human cell lines and primary nociceptive neuron cultures both show limitations (discussed above) in AIM 1 we plan to investigate the effect of Nav1.7/1.8/1.9 I-SNF mutations on human nociceptor-like neurons excitability. We will also test the hypothesis of whether the hyperexcitability is responsible for the axonal degeneration observed in I-SFN.We will use a two-step experimental approach: 1) we will transdifferentiate human fibroblasts into nociceptor-like neurons and 2) we will use the clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system to generate these mutations in the aforementioned human nociceptive neurons. We will determine whether these mutated human nociceptive neurons also present a hyperexcitable phenotype using electrophysiology (using both voltage- and current-clamp and calcium imaging) similarly to what is observed with HEK293 cells and sensory neurons primary culture. We will then compare the observed electrical pattern with the one obtained from nociceptors derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with these mutations (from Ingemar Merkies, a collaborator of Prof. Woolf). The impact of these mutations on the cellular excitability using this approach will give results that are physiologically closer to what happens in humans and also provide a proof-of-concept that this new experimental approach is relevant. To have better insight on the in vivo effect of Nav1.7/1.8/1.9 I-SNF mutations, in AIM 2 we will also take advantage of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate knock-in mice harboring these mutations and test whether these mice develop I-SNF. We will use optogenetics, a tool that allows a very precise spatiotemporal control of neuronal excitability, to investigate how these mutations modify the cellular excitability of sensory neurons upon exogenous stimulation. In AIM3 we will again take advantage of optogenetics to investigate whether stimulation of nociceptors harbouring Nav1.7/1.8/1.9 I-SNF mutations with blue light strengthen the input into the spinal cord.Finally, as I extensively investigated Nedd4-2 effect on Navs turnover, in AIM 4 I will also use the CRISPR/Cas9 system to mutate this ubiquitin ligase in nociceptors-like human neurons and in mice and test the hypothesis that this leads to an increased neuronal excitability and pain hypersensitivity.

CALR encodes for the protein calreticulin, which is a chaperone in the Endoplasmic Reticulum. We have recently shown that the CALR mutant proteins physically interact with the Thrombopoietin Receptor (MPL), thereby activating it in a ligand-independent manner. This results in the downstream activation of the JAK-STAT pathway. However, the molecular mechanisms of the oncogenic program driven by the CALR mutations is not completely understood. The elucidation of these molecular details will not only help in understanding the biology of these mutations, but will also provide a foundation for the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Towards this, we have generated a transgenic mouse model with a conditional âknock-inâ of the human CALR-del52 mutant within the mouse endogenous CALR locus. The mice develop an ET phenotype at the age of 8 weeks. We propose to characterize development of the MPN phenotype in these mice with age. This will be done by assessing the peripheral blood values, FACS analysis of the hematopoietic tissues, assessment of splenomegaly and by histology of the bone marrow (for fibrosis development). Bone marrow transplantation experiments will be performed to evaluate the stem cell cell-intrinsic requirement of the CALR mutants and engraftment capabilities. As the CALR mutant proteins induce the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, we propose to genetically (using JAK2 and STAT5 conditional knock-out mice) and pharmacologically (using JAK2 inhibitor - Ruxolitinib) interfere with this pathway, to assess the requirement of this pathway for the oncogenic function of CALR mutant proteins. To elucidate the oncogenic program of mutant CALR, we will perform a transcriptome analysis of the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) isolated from these mice. Differential expression analysis will be performed with state of the art bioinformatics tools, to identify the genes/pathways most relevant for CALR mutant driven disease. The relevance of these genes to mutant CALR oncogenicity will be tested using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. A low-complexity gRNA pool will be generated against the most significantly upregulated/downregulated genes and will be expressed (lentivirally) in the HSCs of CALR-del52;Rosa-Cas9 transgenic mice. The transduced cells will be transplanted into recipient NSG mice and the most depleted/enriched gRNAs will be identified by performing Next Generation Sequencing. The most interesting hits will be further validated in vitro (Ba/F3 cells) and in vivo using over-expression/knock-out mouse models. This study will be performed within a period of 3 years.

Researchers have used mice and rats to model kidney damage seen in human patients with diabetes, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, lupus and fibrosis injury. Although many useful gene and protein targets have emerged from these studies, rodent models are limited for a number of reasons. One is the ethical issues around the numbers of mice in particular that are needed to generate gene knockouts, particularly tissue-specific knockouts (usually in the 100s-1000s). A second limitation is the fact that mice and rat models do not faithfully recapitulate the disease phenotype seen in the human kidney. For example, the most commonly used genetic strain of mice, C57Bl/6, are resistant to diabetes-induced kidney damage. Many gene and proteins that have been identified in rodent models have failed to materialise as bona fide targets when tested in humans. These limitations have led to a growing frustration in academia and industry, and led to the drive to improve our models of CKD. We propose to establish a new model of kidney injury based on 3D organoids derived from human iPS cells. Our protocol of differentiation triggers the formation of both glomerular and tubular epithelial cells that form themselves into glomerular-like and tubule-like structures (Fig. 2). These organoids will form the basis of the three interrelated project aims, which will use cell biology, microscopy and single cell sequencing to interrogate the genetic profile of the kidney organoid cells (Aim 1). We will then establish a range of new models of CKD exposing organoids to high glucose and other important drivers of kidney disease to induce damage. Cutting-edge single cell sequencing using the 10 x Genomics platform (https://www.10xgenomics.com) will be applied in-house to interrogate the genetic profiles of each of the different kidney-like cells in 3D organoids in normal versus disease conditions. The sequencing data obtained from the various organoid damage models will then be compared to existing datasets from previously used rodent models of disease available on the GEO bioinformatics platform (e.g. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/GDSbrowser?acc=GDS3990). The critical role of Gremlin1 in organoid formation and response to fibrotic insult will be tested using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Successful completion of this project will achieve a number of scientific objectives. The first is the development of a next generation cell culture organoid model of kidney injury and CKD. The development of 3D organoid models is a common direction of travel in many fields, as the limitations of studying individual cells in isolation are becoming increasingly evident. A major outcome from this proposal will be reduction potential under the NC3Rs framework. Given the numbers of mice used for CKD experiments each year (estimated at approximately 68,000 in 2016, Fig. 1), and the moderate/severe grading of many of these experiments, we believe there is exciting potential to reduce these numbers in the future. Another significant deliverable will be the use of human iPS cells to generate the kidney organoids, which will represent a translationally relevant model of human kidney disease. The potential to modify the ES cells at the gene level using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing will allow researchers to interrogate the role of their gene of interest not only in kidney development, but also in kidney cell responses to disease insults in a 3D organoid. We will use our networks such as the European Renal Cell Study Group (ERSCG) in the UK, Europe and the US to promote the potential of the organoid model as an alternative to rodent models of CKD. Dissemination of our results at national meetings such as the UK Kidney Week and the American Society of Nephrology will maximise the potential of widespread uptake and create exciting added value for the project.

Specifically, a platform of iPSCs were generated by Dr. Johnstone in Edinburgh from family members with NDE1 duplication, resulting in different phenotypes, including ASD and Schizophrenia, and shared with our group in Weizmann.

Since our preliminary data have shown that we can grow "mini-brain" organoids, in which we can follow neuronal proliferation and initial spatial layer formation, we aim to use our refined protocols to grow such organoids of the patient-derived cells (before and after CRISPR). In parallel, cellular characterization of the different cell lines (iPSCs from patients, family members, and NDE1-mutants that were generated in the Weizmann group) will be conducted at the level of neuronal stem cells and at a later step at the level of a more differentiated culture. <br /><br />During the proposed travel period, Lihi shall investigate how the NDE1 signaling pathway is altered in the ASD and SCZ patients' cells in comparison with the other cell lines using the infrastructure in Edinburgh, with emphasis on transcriptomic and proteomic analyses. Transcriptomics is a powerful method for discovering changes to cell types and signaling pathways. Although NDE1 is not known to be involved in regulation of gene expression, our preliminary results may suggest that differences at the level of gene expression could be expected. Furthermore, Reverse Phase Protein lysate microarray analysis (RPPA) of NPCs derived from the NDE1 patient iPSC had shown differences in key transcription factors implicated in cellular proliferation (Johnstone; unpublished data). Further exploration of these pathways would also be pertinent to the proteomic/pathways studies in the organoids and may represent a potential pharmacological target for intervention that could be screened in our future downstream studies.

164	Dr Vecellio Matteo	University of Basel	2016-10-01	2019-09-30	Characterization of the interaction network of exported proteins in Plasmodium falciparum	The rational to study the interaction network of exported proteins in Plasmodium falciparum lies in the crucial importance of the export of virulence factors to the surface of infected host cells and other modifications allowing the parasiteâs survival in its host cell which are the sole cause of morbidity and mortality.P. falciparum, the deadliest form of malaria, exports during its blood cycle over 10% of its proteome into the host cell leading to major host cell modifications such as presentation of adhesins on the surface or change of membrane rigidity and permeability. Why the parasites need to export such large number of proteins is unknown and their interaction is not understood. Only for a small number of proteins a tentative function was determined and hardly any information on exported proteins in the transmission forms, the gametocytes exist.With this project, we aim to elucidate the dynamic interaction network of exported proteins in P. falciparum and their contribution to morbidity during the entire erythrocytic life cycle including gametocytes. Recent technical advances to genetically manipulate P. falciparum make this project more feasible. Using the CRISPR/CAS9 system we will generate knock out parasites of a number of selected exported proteins including a number of PHIST proteins, which were frequently found in the host cell and for which we have shown that they play an important role in anchoring the virulence factor PfEMP1 to the cytoskeleton. With this system but also the alternative selection linked transfection we will generate inducible knock down clones or introduce endogenous tags. All clones will be used for phenotypical analyses using an array of established and innovative methods (e.g. microsphiltration membrane rigidity measures, electron-microscopy for ultrastructural analyses). Protein-protein interaction will be identified using conventional immuno-precipitations but also the BioID system which introduces a promiscuous biotin ligase, which subsequently allows the identification of biotinylated proteins that were in close proximity of the protein of interest. Potential interactions will be confirmed and validated by various techniques such as NMR, fluorescent polarization experiments, fluorescence cross correlation spectroscopy, or split GFP system.We finally expect to obtain through this project an interaction network that is important for Maurerâs cleft function and transport and fixation of PfMP1 on the erythrocyte surface. In particular, we expect clarification of the function of PHIST proteins and their interaction with host cytoskeleton proteins.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div.

Uncontrolled proliferation and maturation arrest are hallmarks of leukemic blasts, the disease-defining cells. Current therapies mainly focus on the deregulated proliferation of blasts; an alternative therapeutic approach is to correct the differentiation defect of leukemia cells and drive the malignant cells into terminal maturation, as successfully exemplified in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a distinct subtype of AML. The overreaching objective of this proposal is to identify and elucidate new targets for differentiation in AML, with the ultimate goal of clinical translation.Specific aims include identification of new differentiation targets using state-of-the-art CRISPR-Cas screening in AML; validation of novel candidate proteins controlling myeloid maturation in multiple models of AML; and understanding the mechanistic role of new AML differentiation targets. This study will uncover a new group of potential therapeutic targets as prime candidates for drug development that will set the stage for future trials assessing differentiation therapies in AML.

In this proposal we strive to unravel how aberrant assembly of protein-RNA complexes may contribute to ALS neuropathology. For this purpose we will analyse the ability of TDP-43, an RNA-binding protein (RBP) commonly associated with ALS, to assemble on RNA transcripts in complex with additional RBPs. We hypothesise that the low complexity region (LCR) of TDP-43 coordinates binding to other RBPs and thereby promotes cooperative RNA interactions. The aim of our study is to elucidate how the composition of TDP-43/RBP complexes influences its affinity and specificity for different RNA binding sites, and thereby affects processing of neurologically relevant transcripts. The successful completion will address basic questions regarding the formation of RNA-protein complexes, and may also uncover new therapeutic avenues for ALS treatment. Our study will involve generation of isogenic cell lines (HEK Flp-Inâ¢ and CRISPR/Cas9-edited iPS cells) that will be used for state-of-the-art interaction studies (BioID, APEX, BLI) and development of a variant iCLIP method to elucidate how and where TDP-43 binds transcripts in disease-relevant models.

167	Dr Vecellio Matteo	University of Zurich	2014-07-01	2017-06-30	TCF and Ã-catenin independent outputs of Wingless/Wnt signaling	A small and conserved set of signaling pathways underlies and orchestrates embryonic development and, in the adult, tissue homeostasis. To execute the diverse responses that constitute these processes the biological outputs of the pathways need to be correspondingly diverse. This can be achieved in a number of ways, such as by integrating the inputs of multiple pathways. Another potential mechanism, which has received little attention so far, is the recruitment of additional transcription factors to expand the repertoire of the genetic program that is activated. By additional factors we mean transcription factors other than the archetypal ones, such as the TCF and Gli proteins in the case of Wnt and Hedgehog signaling, respectively. For the Wnt pathway, the central tenet is that its transcriptional output is mediated by the partnership of TCF and Ã-catenin; the implicit assumption being that the entire transcriptional output is mediated by TCF and Ã-catenin. This belief has never been subjected to a systematic inquisition. In the proposed project we will redress this.Our approach leverages on the fact that it is now practical to routinely measure the transcriptional status of the entire genome. Additionally, novel techniques such as STARR-seq allow us to identify on a genome-wide scale the DNA regulatory regions that are responsive to signaling pathways. Perhaps most crucial of all are avant-garde genome engineering techniques, such as the CRISPR/Cas technique, which enable us to efficiently create genetic mutations - even in multiple genes simultaneously - in cell lines and in animal models. Using a combination of these state of the art techniques we will define the extent to which the transcriptional program triggered by canonical Wnts can bypass Ã-catenin and/or TCFs in Drosophila and mammalian model systems. In addition to looking at activated target genes we will also investigate the phenomenon of ligand-dependent repression of target genes.1)We will generate cell lines mutant for TCF and Ã-catenin using the CRISPR/Cas technique.2)We will assay the transcriptional changes triggered by the binding of Wnt ligands in these cells.3)We will use techniques such as STARR-seq and ChIP-seq to unearth responsive DNA regulatory regions.The data we generate provides the foundation for mechanistic studies that will elucidate the responsible factors, how these are incorporated into the Wnt pathway and what the biological significance of those side-pathways is during development and in disease. The insights that will be generated will promote the development of more effective therapeutic interventions into diseases where Wnt signaling is deregulated.

168	Dr Vecellio Matteo	Cambridge Institute for Medical Research University of Cambridge Cambridge Biomedical Campus	2016-06-01	2018-05-31	Identification, characterization and targeting of efflux pumps in Mycobacterium abscessus	Background: The prevalence of Mycobacterium abscessus, a rapidly growing non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) is increasing in the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) population. As a result of multidrug resistance, M. abscessus causes a chronic incurable infection in most CF patients and represents a major emerging threat to their health. Several efflux pumps have been identified in M. tuberculosis, where they have been proposed to impair mycobacterial killing, to cause macrophage-induced drug tolerance and may also promote mycobacterial growth in absence of anti-mycobacterial drugs. Inhibiting efflux pumps may thus favourably improve both, mycobacterial killing and drug susceptibility. Efflux pump inhibitors in combination with anti-mycobacterial drugs could potentially increase the number of effective drugs available and reduce treatment duration (currently averaging at over 2 years). However, the role and function of efflux pumps in M. abscessus is at present unknown.Aim 1: Identification of putative efflux pumps in M. abscessusApproach: Whole genome sequencing data of more than 1900 clinical isolates of M. abscessus is available at the CIMR / WTSI. All putative efflux pumps will be identified based on sequence homology. Furthermore polymorphisms will be assessed. Estimates indicate that M. abscessus has about 30-35 potential efflux pump genes. Genetic data will be correlated with clinical metadata to determine whether specific mutations are associated with clinical outcome and treatment response.Relevance: Putative efflux pumps of M. abscessus and their polymorphisms will be identified and associated with markers of clinical outcome. Aim 2: Characterisation of putative efflux pumps in M. abscessus Approach: Identified genes of putative M. abscessus efflux pumps will be knocked out using the CRISPR/Cas9 platform. Wild type and efflux pump knockout M. abscessus mutants will be challenged with anti-mycobacterial drugs and bacterial killing assessed, in broth culture and after macrophage infection. Relevance: Major efflux pumps affecting mycobacterial killing and tolerance will be identified using established high throughput methods of genetic editing and phenotypic analysis.Aim 3: Pharmacological inhibition of efflux pumps Approach: Specific and efficacious inhibitors of major efflux pumps in M. abscessus will be identified and tested in culture and macrophage experiments. Relevance: Efflux pump inhibitor plus anti-mycobacterial drug combinations that improve M. abscessus killing will be identified.Aim 4: Characterisation of the efflux pump expression in M. abscessusApproach: Efflux pumps will be tagged with fluorescent proteins using CRISPR/Cas9. Macrophages will be infected with M. abscessus GFP knockin mutants. The temporal dynamics of efflux pump expression will be assessed using live cell confocal fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry Relevance: Efflux pump expression in M. abscessus upon macrophage infection will be assessed and, in future, potentially manipulated.

169	Dr Vecellio Matteo	Center for Cancer Research Massachusetts Institute of Technology	2015-01-01	2016-06-30	Understanding the mechanism of metastatic dissemination in small cell lung cancer	Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive and clinically intractable subtype of lung cancer. Despite intensive treatment, widespread metastases are often unavoidable and the long-term prognosis is dismal in SCLC patients. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of SCLC metastatic dissemination will be the cornerstone for developing novel and more effective treatment. To facilitate dissecting the mechanism of SCLC pathogenesis, a genetically-engineered mouse model (GEMM) of SCLC has been developed, which bears close resemblance with human SCLC both in their genetic deregulation and in their highly metastatic nature. Herein, we propose the utility of this GEMM to identify driver mutations for metastasis. We will first harvest tumors from primary sites and from metastatic lesions, then perform exome sequencing to identify subclones in primary tumors which give rise to metastasis, followed by RNA sequencing to identify gene signatures associated with these metastatic subclones. Once the candidates are obtained, we will screen with the transplant model, by inoculating the mSCLC cell lines harboring a luciferase reporter allele into immunocompromised mice after manipulating the expression of interested genes. After subcutaneous tumor transplantation, the metastasis formation will be closely followed up by luminescence signals. Finally, we will validate selected genes from the screening and perform in vivo editing of these genes in the GEMM by the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, and follow up by microCT/MRI to assess if the burden of SCLC metastasis could be altered. With this project, we aim to identify and validate mutations driving SCLC metastasis, in the hope of developing new treatment strategies against such formidable disease.

However, the majority of MM patients that respond initially to proteasome inhibitor therapy develop resistance over the course of their disease, and ultimately die from PI-refractory MM. In a multicenter national phase II clinical trial performed within the SAKK, we have identified the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir as a drug with unprecedented clinical activity in PI-refractory MM (Driessen, 2016, ASH abstract 487). The molecular target and mechanism of nelfinavir activity against PI-refractory MM are unknown. Our unpublished preclinical data identify ER-resident chaperones, transmembrane transporters and mitochondria-related proteins as nelfinavir-binding targets and pinpoint the mechanism of action of nelfinavir to interference with ER-based protein transport or folding and energy metabolism.With the current proposal, we shall identify key cellular mechanisms affecting susceptibility of MM and PI-refractory MM to nelfinavir treatment using CRISPR-Cas9 genome-wide loss-of-function screening. To validate the role of certain candidate genes in nelfinavir sensitivity/resistance, selected candidates from the primary screen will be individually knocked-out using the targeted CRISPR-Cas9 approach. Such data are required from the international scientific community to support the development of nelfinavir towards clinical availability for MM, possibly outside the commercial setting. Our group is globally in the leading position to elaborate these.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Scientific Exchanges	4500.0CHF

When provided with the proper growth factors, these stem cells grow into polarized epithelia which consist of proliferating stem cells and postmitotic differentiated cells. Importantly, stem cells in organoid cultures are genotypically and phenotypically stable, and can be genetically modified using genome editing tools. In addition, when orthotopically transplanted into mouse models they can readily integrate and generate functional epithelia, suggesting that organoids are promising for ex vivo gene therapy approaches.In a proof-of-concept work we recently corrected disease-causing CFTR alleles in intestinal organoids derived from cystic fibrosis patients using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool. However, although functionality of the repaired receptor could be demonstrated in in vitro assays, we did not proceed towards clinical application for the reason that cystic fibrosis is a multi-organ disease in which stem cells of several epithelial tissues would need to be replaced. Importantly, this hurdle does not exist for most metabolic liver diseases, in which the correction of the disease causing allele solely in hepatocytes would be sufficient to cure the specific syndrome. In addition, hepatocyte transplantations have been already successfully performed in the clinics as an alternative to whole liver transplantations.For these reasons we decided to focus on establishing an ex vivo clinical-grade gene therapy approach for inherited metabolic disorders in the liver. In particular, we will focus on Urea Cycle Disorder (UCD), which is an inborn monogenetic disease caused by the deficiency of one of the urea cycle enzymes. Our goal is to tackle UCD with an ex vivo gene therapy approach, in which liver organoids from patient biopsies will be established, repaired by CRISPR/Cas9, differentiated into hepatocytes which can be transplanted back into the patient liver to restore sufficient enzyme activity	Swiss National Science Foundation	MD-PhD fellowships (funded by SNSF)	180000.0CHF
172	Dr Vecellio Matteo	Donelly Centre for Cellular + Biomolecular Research University of Toronto	2016-01-01	2017-06-30	Identification of genetic networks required for reprogramming of cancer cells in response to metabolic stress using next-generation CRISPR-Cas9 screens	A hallmark of cancer is the reprogramming of cellular metabolism in order to fuel growth and division. However, the rapid proliferation of cancer cells leads to several environmental stress conditions such as acidosis, hypoxia or local nutrient deprivation. In order to successfully establish tumor formation and metastasis cancer cells need to adapt to these harsh conditions and are required to rapidly reprogram gene expression in order to survive. The proposed research aims to identify the sensors and regulators of environmental stress conditions such as nutrient deprivation. Towards this goal genetic screens using the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas9 technology will be performed under various growth conditions and in different genetic backgrounds. The work of our lab and others have demonstrated that CRISPR-Cas9 gene knockout screens have the potential to discover near complete genetic pathways and are therefore expected to reveal regulators of stress-induced reprogramming at unprecedented depth. Candidate genes will be functionally characterized using biochemical assays and gene expression data. The unique combination of genetic screens, gene expression profiles and focused biochemical assays is expected to provide novel insight into the molecular mechanism of the reprogramming events required for cancer cells to adapt to metabolic stress conditions. Furthermore, the proposed research may reveal novel cancer therapeutic targets by highlighting genetic vulnerabilities associated with cellular metabolism.

173	Dr Vecellio Matteo	University of Zurich	2016-10-01	2019-09-30	Regulation of nucleotide excision repair by histone methyltransferases	Our aim is to understand how histone methyltransferases regulate DNA damage recognition by the global-genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) machinery in human cells.Background: Maintenance of genome stability is essential to prevent cancer and premature aging. GG-NER is a versatile âbig enzymeâ machine that safeguards the genome by removing bulky DNA adducts induced by genotoxic agents like UV light, chemical carcinogens, chemotherapeutic drugs and oxygen radicals. To be effective, this repair machine must cope with the condensation of its chromatin substrate where DNA is tightly wrapped around histones giving rise to nucleosome arrays. Our preceding work provides strong evidence for a novel role of the histone methyltransferase KMT2H in GG-NER reactions in chromatin. Working hypothesis:- Chromatin cannot simply be considered as an accessibility barrier but contributes to the damage response by priming damaged sites for DNA repair activities.- Three main molecular factors prime chromatin for DNA repair: histone modifications, histone variants and ATP-dependent remodeling.- Histone methyltransferases are key modifiers promoting DNA damage recognition in the GG-NER process.Specific aims: This project is focused on how histone methyltransferases regulate GG-NER reactions in the packed human genome. We will analyze GG-NER activity in living cells to determine the role of (i) methyltransferases that add chromatin-relaxing methyl groups to histones (for example to H3 at position K4) (ii) methyltransferases that add chromatin-condensing methyl groups to histones (for example to H3K9), (iii) chromatin remodelers like the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) family known to be recruited or activated by histone methylation. Experimental design: We established activity assays and fluorescence-based imaging methods to monitor NER reactions in human cells. For screening, histone-modifying enzymes will be down regulated using RNA interference. For confirmatory and mechanistic studies, we will employ cells with CRISPR/cas9-induced gene deletions or mutations. The assembly of GG-NER complexes will be evidence in situ by visualizing the relocation of repair subunits to UV lesion spots. To study the assembly of GG-NER complexes in the nucleosome landscape, chromatin will be solubilized and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against histones/modified histones. Composition of immunoprecipitates will be analyzed by targeted (immunoblotting) and untargeted (mass spectrometry) methods. Supporting flow cytometry experiments, cytotoxicity tests, colony-forming and comet assays will be performed for cell cycle, viability and genome stability analyses.Expected value: Due to the very high frequency of damages that the GG-NER machine needs to process simultaneously (hundred thousand or more DNA lesions in a single genome), this reaction provides a unique model system to understand how nucleosome dynamics and DNA accessibility are regulated on a global scale in the chromatin of human cells. This project, therefore, paves the way to novel pharmacologic strategies that stimulate or inhibit nucleosome fluctuations using emerging methyltransferase or demethylase inhibitors, particularly with the intent of sensitizing cancer cells to radio- or chemotherapy.

Aggregation and abnormal functions of the mutant HTT (mHTT) cause motor, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms in patients, which lead to death in 15-20 years. Currently, there are no curative treatments for HD but experimental approaches based on drug, cell and gene therapy are under investigation. Among them, mHTT silencing using small hairpin RNA (shRNA) displays important physiopathological benefits but requires long-term and continuous treatment and is leading to a partial HTT silencing. The recently described method based on the bacterial clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system is a promising tool for gene editing in mammals and offers a unique opportunity to investigate a therapeutic strategy based on DNA modifications. In this project, we propose to use the CRISPR technology for gene editing and repair of HD mutation. Both, in vitro and in vivo experiments will be performed to validate various strategies of mHTT gene editing.

In recent years, the Hippo signaling pathway was found to play an evolutionarily conserved key role in organ size determination through regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis and stemness. More importantly, deregulation of the Hippo pathway underlies tumorigenesis of many human cancers. In response to signals such as mechanical stress, the Hippo pathway Mst1/2-Lats1/2 kinase cascade phosphorylates and inhibits YAP and TAZ transcription co-activators, therefore regulates gene expression and tissue growth. Nevertheless, the subcellular localization of Hippo signaling is largely unknown. In this project, through collaborative efforts, we will tag all endogenous Hippo pathway proteins using CRISPR-mediated homologous recombination in both mammalian cells and Drosophila. This resource will allow mechanistic and functional analysis of subcellular spatial dynamics of Hippo pathway proteins upon physiological stimulation and during development or regeneration. The proposed work will not only address an important albeit obscure area of Hippo signaling and organ size control but will also demonstrate the general value of CRISPR-mediated protein tagging technique in solving the long-standing difficulty of cell signaling spatial dynamics investigation.

178	Professor Qasim Waseem	University of Lausanne	2017-10-01	2019-09-30	Manipulating trinucleotide repeat instability	Expanded CAG/CTG repeat instability is a hallmark of 14 different neurological diseases. Longer repeat tracts in the germlines cause more severe phenotypes in the offspring of patients, whereas the bias towards repeat expansion in somatic tissues is thought to accelerate the progression of these diseases. Thus, uncovering the molecular mechanisms of CAG repeat expansion will help our understanding of the cause of expanded CAG/CTG repeat diseases. Moreover, contracting the repeat tract would remove the underlying cause of the disease and potentially provide a much needed therapeutic avenue. The goal of this grant, therefore, is to better understand CAG/CTG repeat instability such that we can eventually manipulate it. We focus on the role of local chromatin structure and folding in the instability process. We will also pursue a CRISPR-Cas9-based method that we have recently developed that specifically induces repeat contraction. We will profit from our expertise in culture cell lines, molecular genetics, and genome editing to move into disease models, in particular using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Specifically we will ask:1) Does HDAC5 induce expansions in patient-derived iPSCs and worsen the cellular phenotypes?2) Does chromatin folding at expanded CAG repeats contribute to repeat instability?3) Can the Cas9 nickase reverse cellular and behavioral phenotypes in disease models?

Transcriptional control during embryogenesis is extremely dynamic and recent evidence indicates that often several enhancers participate in driving gene expression in a tissue-specific manner. An ideal experimental model to approach these questions is the mouse embryonic limb, as the genetic mechanisms controlling its morphogenesis are well known. In particular, my PhD studies are focused on the study of the transcriptional regulation of Ptch1, which encodes the main receptor of the SHH ligand during limb development. The SHH pathway is essential for morphogenesis of diverse embryonic tissues, including the limb, and its deregulation contributes to tumorigenesis and human congenital malformations. During the period funded by the Doc.Mobility fellowship, I propose to approach two different aspects concerning Ptch1 regulation: (1) I will define the regulatory robustness of the mechanisms controlling Ptch1 expression in the mouse limb bud by using a loss-of-function strategy that takes advantage of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology; (2) I will address the mechanisms by which mouse limb bud cells are able to detect graded SHH signaling and elaborate a transcriptional response accordingly. To do so, I will use a transgenic reporter setup in which the affinity of the transcription factor motifs within a SHH-responding enhancer can be altered and the functional consequences evaluated in a straightforward manner. In summary, the research proposed here will advance our understanding on how the SHH pathway, with essential functions in development and disease, is regulated and interpreted at the transcriptional level.

As investigations of how DNA variation and mutation contributes to disease advance, demand for GA mouse models increases. Recently, this demand has been aided by the new CRISPR/Cas9 technology, an RNA guided nuclease system, which permits the production of models at unprecedented efficiencies. Already the biomedical community is applying this new technology widely for mouse model production. Meanwhile, the 3Rs impact of the technology remains unexplored. This proposal seeks to address aspects of the technology that, our experience shows, can lead to substantial increases in mouse usage and wasted production of undesirable genotypes. Following CRISPR/Cas9 microinjection into mouse zygotes, the founders generated are invariably mosaic, due to the persistence of the nuclease after the first cleavage event. Founders must be bred extensively to ensure transmission of the desired allele, increasing mouse usage. The mosaicism also precludes the phenotyping of the founder generation, which, given the high efficiencies of CRISPR/Cas9 might be feasible for certain phenotypic screens. We plan to explore whether the use of Cas9 fusions with destabilizing or cell-cycle regulatory domains can be used to confine nuclease activity to the 1-cell stage and thus eliminate mosaicism. Furthermore, the mode of Cas9 supply, protein or maternally contributed via transgenic Cas9 overexpression will be investigated for its impact on mosaicism. As a potential refinement, methods to address and limit deleterious indel mutagenesis during knock-in mice production, a class of model particularly sought after for interrogating disease-related mutation, will be investigated. Whether the mode of nuclease delivery, the use of cell cycle-regulated Cas9 and co-injection of wild-type repair templates can impact the rate of indel mutation at the non-targeted allele will be assessed.

LETM1 is associated with the Wolf-Hirschhorn Syndrome (WHS), a severe childhood disorder with congenital anomalies and intellectual disability. Seizures in WHS patients strongly correlate with LETM1 haploinsufficiency. The implication of LETM1 and thus, mitochondrial dysfunctions, in the pathogenesis of seizures; coupled to the crucial role of mitochondrial functions for the neuronal membrane excitability, led us to propose studying LETM1 in the developmental model system Danio rerio. We propose to investigate for the first time the role of letm1 and its homologue letm2 in Danio rerio, a strong model for vertebrate development. We aim to clarify when and where letm1 and letm2 are active during the early development of the zebrafish. To further determine the letm1/ letm2 knockout phenotypes, we generated TALEN and Crispr/Cas9 mediated letm1 and letm2 knockout fish lines. Aiming at a basic understanding of the biological role of letm1 and mitochondrial osmoregulation in the early development of the zebrafish with particular focus on the brain function, we will study embryonic and neuronal mitochondrial functions with regard to K+-H+ exchange and Ca2+ activity as well as locomotory behaviour, epileptogenic signals and design strategies to rescue the observed phenotypes. We will ask if letm2 plays a similar or different role as compared to letm1. The proposed study is expected to reveal if and how letm1 and potentially letm2 caused mitochondrial dysfunctions impede the early development and the nervous system activity in the zebrafish and establish a disease model for seizures in the WHS for future drug screenings.

Accordingly, up to 90% of both haematological and solid malignancies including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and malignant pleura mesothelioma (MPM) exhibit telomerase re-activation. Non-coding mutations in the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) core promoter have been discovered with high prevalence across defined cancer types strengthening the importance of telomerase hyper-activation during malignant transformation and progression. Indeed, several studies including our own have already proven an association of TERT promoter mutations with enhanced gene expression and dismal prognosis in GBM and melanoma. However, the underlying biological mechanisms causing worse outcome are widely speculative so far. Thus this project follows the hypothesis that presence of a TERT promoter mutation and consequently TERT overexpression facilitates a more aggressive type of malignant progression irrespective of the affected tissue or cell type. Accordingly, we aim to elucidate on a comparative basis, the impact of TERT promoter mutations and its interaction with a nearby single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs2853669) on cancer cell aggressiveness in GBM and further confirm promising results in MPM. Moreover, we hypothesize that these genomic TERT promoter variants have an impact on secondary DNA structures and alter the sensitivity of malignant cells towards TERT promoter targeting by quadruplex stabilising agents. To validate these hypotheses we will use the following approaches: 1) Comparison of cell biological differences (growth, migration, stem cell properties and therapy response) between TERT promoter wild-type and mutated GBM cell lines and isogenic cell models (generated by CRISPR/Cas9 technology and thus only differing with regard to the TERT promoter mutation status). 2) Investigation of TERT promoter activity using luciferase reporter constructs containing wild-type or mutated sequence with our without the rs2853669 SNP. These experiments will be performed in cell models of GBM and MPM with variable endogenous TERT promoter sequences and compared to isogenic cell lines of each entity. 3) Dissection of transcription factor (TF) recruitment to different TERT promoter variants in GBM (DNA/protein pulldown followed by shot-gun proteomics mass-spectrometry in comparison to chromatin immunoprecipitation). 4) Knock-down of the most promising TF and impact on telomerase stability, promoter activity and on non-canonical TERT functions including NF-?B and WNT pathway activation. 5) Comparison of gene expression patterns in cell models of GBM harbouring a differing TERT promoter status and extraction of altered signatures using systems biology approaches (GEO, GORILLA, GSEA). 6) Analysing the impact of the TERT promoter status on sensitivity towards experimental telomerase inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. The project will be performed by the applicant (Daniela LÃ¶tsch) in close collaboration with clinical partners (Departments of Neurosurgery and Thoracic Surgery in Vienna and Linz) and collaboration partners abroad (Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology; DKFZ-Heidelberg and Medicinal and Bioinorganic Chemistry, Cardiff, UK).

187	Professor Evans Jeffry	University of Glasgow	2015-07-01	2020-06-30	Translational Cancer Therapeutics	BackgroundPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a poor prognosis and novel pre-clinical and clinical approaches are required to develop more effective strategies to treat pre-invasive, micro-metastatic, and advanced disease. We have developed a number of novel genetically-engineered murine models (and cell lines from these tumours) that have allowed us to understand the biological function of key tumour suppressor genes and oncogenes in vivo in both normal tissues and tumours, allowed us to identify and characterise the signalling pathways that are deregulated at the early stages of pancreatic cancer, during the development and progression of the invasive and metastatic phenotype, and that are potential therapeutic targets in advanced disease. AimsThe aim of our work is to determine how potential anti-cancer agents might best be evaluated in subsequent clinical trials in PDAC. Specifically, we will (a) investigate key pathways downstream of KRAS to develop therapies in advanced disease. We will focus on the mTOR pathway, to explore which downstream targets are important for tumour cell survival and proliferation, identify in which genetic backgrounds that target inhibition will have most efficacy, and to pre-clinically test inhibitors and combinatorial approaches(b) optimize therapy in localised disease by targeting myeloid cells to suppress metastasis and to improve immunotherapy. We will investigate the key immune cell types and signals in the PDAC microenvironment and how they impinge on immune suppression, and assess how best to modulate tumour immunity in vivo, with regards to rational combinations. Initially, we will focus on inhibition of CXCR2 or CSF1R to enhance T-cell tumour infiltration and increases anti-PD1 efficacy.MethodsWe will use clinically relevant inhibitors, shRNA or CRISPR / Cas9 technology to inhibit candidate targets in cell lines from appropriate mouse models. Analysis by qPCR or immunoblotting will be performed to validate the mechanism of action of successful candidates and to identify companion biomarkers for future clinical studies. We will use our mouse models for genetic validation and to assess the efficacy of candidate therapies or combinations, using PET imaging to assess therapeutic efficacy with regard to tumour metabolism and proliferation where relevant. We will identify potential genotype-specific biomarker signatures in murine models and confirm the clinical relevance of these in human tissue microarrays, which can then be used to guide patient selection in subsequent clinical studies.We will use the results of these studies to develop clinical trials in patients with PDAC.

188	Dr Zelenay Santiago	University of Manchester	2015-08-01	2022-07-31	Manchester Immunology Group	Identification and characterisation of mediators of tumour promoting or inhibitory inflammation: The notion of immune-based control of cancer has historically been controversial but has gained great support from the remarkable clinical success of certain types of immunotherapy over the past few years. This is certainly the case of melanoma, where some patients have shown complete and durable responses upon treatment with immune checkpoint blocking antibodies. Also promising results were obtained in treatment-refractory cancers such as metastatic non-small-cell lung carcinoma, a type of cancer that until recently was considered as unresponsive to immunotherapy. Nevertheless, in all cases, only a fraction of patients responds underscoring the need for mechanistic studies to determine why this is the case. Indeed, how tumours evade natural and therapy-induced immune responses is a long-standing question in cancer biology. The concept that cancer induces inflammation and that inflammatory cells at the tumour site promote several key aspects of malignant tumours such as proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis or migration, is well established. On the other hand, some types of inflammation such as the one characterised by T cell infiltration, particularly by cytotoxic T cells, are associated with a favourable prognosis and clinical benefit. Moreover, effective anti-tumour immunity depends on inflammatory mediators that contribute to the activation of immune cells such as dendritic cells. Together, these observations indicate that cancer-associated inflammation can have both tumour-promoting and inhibitory effects. How different types of inflammation are manipulated by a growing tumour and to what extent this constitutes an opportunity for therapeutic intervention remains incompletely explored. In this context, our group investigates the mechanisms by which cancer cells trigger the immune system and simultaneously evade anti-tumour immunity. The aim of this project will be to identify and characterise factors that modulate the function of immune cells such as dendritic cells in the tumour microenvironment, distinguishing mediators promoting anti-tumour immunity from those that support tumour growth. Building on from our recent work (Zelenay et al. Cell 2015), the successful candidate will evaluate how specific genetic mutations in cancer cells impact in their ability to modulate the recruitment and function of immune cells through a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches. These will include implementing CRISPR-Cas9 technology for genome editing of cancer cells bearing defined combinations of oncogenic mutations, the use of genetically-engineered transplantable and autochthonous mouse models of cancer and the analysis of samples from cancer patients.

They are also linked to pathological conditions, such as cancer and viral infections. Filopodia consist of actin filaments that are spatially organized into bundles by actin bundling proteins. Various combinations of bundling proteins are expressed in different cell types, but their specific function and potential redundancy has remained enigmatic. Many actin-regulating proteins in filopodia and other cellular compartments have been studied on the cellular level, examining their influence on cell morphology and dynamics. Understanding filopodial proteins at an ultra-structural level in their native context is another promising approach to deciphering their role. However, for most proteins structural in situ information is unavailable, due to experimental challenges. Our proposal aims to reveal the detailed function and redundancy of actin filament bundlers in filopodia across scales, from the cellular level, down to the scale of individual proteins. We want to correlate protein structure with its role in cell morphology and filopodial morphodynamics, all within the same experimental system. We will generate CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic knockouts of Fascin1, Daam1 and Fimbrin in B16-F1 cells and characterise them on the cellular and ultrastructural level. Live imaging microscopy and sophisticated image analysis will reveal changes in morphodynamical parameters upon knocking out proteins. Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) is a powerful method to provide three-dimensional insights into complex cellular environments, and will be performed to acquire the ultrastructure of filopodia. This will reveal how the density and distribution of filopodial proteins and the actin network organization is affected upon loss of the targeted proteins. Novel image processing techniques (i.e. subtomogram averaging) will be then used to retrieve high-resolution structural information on filopodial proteins within their native environment. Acquiring high-resolution structural information on proteins in their native environment and linking this to morphodynamical parameters will be a significant breakthrough towards a holistic cellular structural biology approach. The project will significantly advance our knowledge on filopodia formation, maintenance and the functional redundancy of bundling proteins. The applicant Georgi Dimchev is an expert in studying actin-mediated cell migration using cell biology methods and imaging techniques. His expertise perfectly complements that within the research group of Florian Schur (co-applicant) at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria, where the applicant intends to address the above-mentioned questions. The Schur lab employs and develops correlative live-cell imaging, cryo-ET and subtomogram averaging methods to study the structure of the actin cytoskeleton in situ.

However, the full scope of benefits that these systems can provide, as well as their costs remain unknown. Specifically, it is unclear whether the benefits against viral infection outweigh the continual costs incurred even in the absence of parasitic elements, and whether CRISPR-Cas systems affect microbial genome diversity in nature. Since CRISPR-Cas systems can impede lateral gene transfer, it is often assumed that they reduce genetic diversity. Conversely, our recent results suggest the exact opposite: that these systems generate a high level of genomic diversity within populations. We have recently combined genomics of environmental strains and experimental genetics to show that archaea frequently acquire CRISPR immune memory, known as spacers, from chromosomes of related species in the environment. The presence of these spacers reduces gene exchange between lineages, indicating that CRISPR-Cas contributes to diversification. We have also shown that such inter-species mating events induce the acquisition of spacers against a strain's own replicons, supporting a role for CRISPR-Cas systems in generating deletions in natural plasmids and unessential genomic loci, again increasing genome diversity within populations. Here we aim to test our hypothesis that CRISPR-Cas systems increase within-population diversity, and quantify their benefits to both cells and populations, using large-scale genomics and experimental evolution. We will explore how these systems alter the patterns of recombination within and between species, and explore the potential involvement of CRISPR-associated proteins in cellular DNA repair. This work will reveal the eco-evolutionary role of CRISPR-Cas systems in shaping microbial populations, and open new research avenues regarding additional roles beyond anti-viral defense.

Recent advances in gene therapy research forecast a bright future for IRD treatment. Retina has distinct advantages for gene therapy because of its small confined space, easy accessibility by surgery, and immune privilege. The FDA in the US has recently approved the first ever gene therapy for treating an IRD (by overexpression of the normal gene). But this popular gene supplementation approach has its weaknesses, e.g. the co-existing influence of the mutant gene and therefore is not suitable for all IRDs. The newly emerged CRISPR/Cas9 technology enables highly specific in-situ gene editing, heralding a new era for developing gene therapy for IRDs. Cacna1f gene encodes a retina abundant Cav1.4 channel protein and mutations in this gene can cause the incomplete congenital stationary night blindness (iCSNB) in human. My current lab identified a spontaneous single mutation in rat Cacna1f gene responsible for iCSNB-like phenotypes in rats. We tested gene supplementation therapy in these rats by overexpressing the wild type Cacna1f gene in the retina, but detected no significant change in visual function. Therefore we will next turn to the CRISPR/Cas9 technology for Cacna1f gene correction. In this proposed project, taking advantage of the UK co-applicantâs extensive experience in mouse gene manipulation, we aim to examine the feasibility and efficacy of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Cacna1f gene correction in Cav1.4 IT mice, which feature a CACNA1F-I756T mutation and reflect very well the functional phenotype seen in human patients with a corresponding CACNA1F-I745T mutation. We will make AAV-based Cas9 and sgRNA constructs designed to cleave target DNA near the genomic site corresponding to CACNA1F-I756T and assess them in 3T3 cells to find the most efficient CRISPR/Cas9 system for DNA cleavage. We will further evaluate CRISPR/Cas9-mediated precise gene editing in 3T3 cells using a donor template of Cacna1f containing an edit. Then we will construct a donor template of wild type Cacna1f (of the same design as the one above) for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene correction in the retina of Cav1.4 IT mice. We will also use a donor template of Cacna1f containing an insertion of Tdtom cassette for easy examination of gene editing efficiency. If acquired data are promising, we will further assess the therapeutic effect of the above gene correction in Cav1.4 IT mice.

200	Dion Vincent	University of Lausanne	2017-10-01	2019-09-30	Manipulating trinucleotide repeat instability	Expanded CAG/CTG repeat instability is a hallmark of 14 different neurological diseases. Longer repeat tracts in the germlines cause more severe phenotypes in the offspring of patients, whereas the bias towards repeat expansion in somatic tissues is thought to accelerate the progression of these diseases. Thus, uncovering the molecular mechanisms of CAG repeat expansion will help our understanding of the cause of expanded CAG/CTG repeat diseases. Moreover, contracting the repeat tract would remove the underlying cause of the disease and potentially provide a much needed therapeutic avenue. The goal of this grant, therefore, is to better understand CAG/CTG repeat instability such that we can eventually manipulate it. We focus on the role of local chromatin structure and folding in the instability process. We will also pursue a CRISPR-Cas9-based method that we have recently developed that specifically induces repeat contraction. We will profit from our expertise in culture cell lines, molecular genetics, and genome editing to move into disease models, in particular using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Specifically we will ask:1) Does HDAC5 induce expansions in patient-derived iPSCs and worsen the cellular phenotypes?2) Does chromatin folding at expanded CAG repeats contribute to repeat instability?3) Can the Cas9 nickase reverse cellular and behavioral phenotypes in disease models?

Transcriptional control during embryogenesis is extremely dynamic and recent evidence indicates that often several enhancers participate in driving gene expression in a tissue-specific manner. An ideal experimental model to approach these questions is the mouse embryonic limb, as the genetic mechanisms controlling its morphogenesis are well known. In particular, my PhD studies are focused on the study of the transcriptional regulation of Ptch1, which encodes the main receptor of the SHH ligand during limb development. The SHH pathway is essential for morphogenesis of diverse embryonic tissues, including the limb, and its deregulation contributes to tumorigenesis and human congenital malformations. During the period funded by the Doc.Mobility fellowship, I propose to approach two different aspects concerning Ptch1 regulation: (1) I will define the regulatory robustness of the mechanisms controlling Ptch1 expression in the mouse limb bud by using a loss-of-function strategy that takes advantage of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology; (2) I will address the mechanisms by which mouse limb bud cells are able to detect graded SHH signaling and elaborate a transcriptional response accordingly. To do so, I will use a transgenic reporter setup in which the affinity of the transcription factor motifs within a SHH-responding enhancer can be altered and the functional consequences evaluated in a straightforward manner. In summary, the research proposed here will advance our understanding on how the SHH pathway, with essential functions in development and disease, is regulated and interpreted at the transcriptional level.

Accordingly, up to 90% of both haematological and solid malignancies including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and malignant pleura mesothelioma (MPM) exhibit telomerase re-activation. Non-coding mutations in the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) core promoter have been discovered with high prevalence across defined cancer types strengthening the importance of telomerase hyper-activation during malignant transformation and progression. Indeed, several studies including our own have already proven an association of TERT promoter mutations with enhanced gene expression and dismal prognosis in GBM and melanoma. However, the underlying biological mechanisms causing worse outcome are widely speculative so far. Thus this project follows the hypothesis that presence of a TERT promoter mutation and consequently TERT overexpression facilitates a more aggressive type of malignant progression irrespective of the affected tissue or cell type. Accordingly, we aim to elucidate on a comparative basis, the impact of TERT promoter mutations and its interaction with a nearby single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs2853669) on cancer cell aggressiveness in GBM and further confirm promising results in MPM. Moreover, we hypothesize that these genomic TERT promoter variants have an impact on secondary DNA structures and alter the sensitivity of malignant cells towards TERT promoter targeting by quadruplex stabilising agents. To validate these hypotheses we will use the following approaches: 1) Comparison of cell biological differences (growth, migration, stem cell properties and therapy response) between TERT promoter wild-type and mutated GBM cell lines and isogenic cell models (generated by CRISPR/Cas9 technology and thus only differing with regard to the TERT promoter mutation status). 2) Investigation of TERT promoter activity using luciferase reporter constructs containing wild-type or mutated sequence with our without the rs2853669 SNP. These experiments will be performed in cell models of GBM and MPM with variable endogenous TERT promoter sequences and compared to isogenic cell lines of each entity. 3) Dissection of transcription factor (TF) recruitment to different TERT promoter variants in GBM (DNA/protein pulldown followed by shot-gun proteomics mass-spectrometry in comparison to chromatin immunoprecipitation). 4) Knock-down of the most promising TF and impact on telomerase stability, promoter activity and on non-canonical TERT functions including NF-?B and WNT pathway activation. 5) Comparison of gene expression patterns in cell models of GBM harbouring a differing TERT promoter status and extraction of altered signatures using systems biology approaches (GEO, GORILLA, GSEA). 6) Analysing the impact of the TERT promoter status on sensitivity towards experimental telomerase inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. The project will be performed by the applicant (Daniela LÃ¶tsch) in close collaboration with clinical partners (Departments of Neurosurgery and Thoracic Surgery in Vienna and Linz) and collaboration partners abroad (Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology; DKFZ-Heidelberg and Medicinal and Bioinorganic Chemistry, Cardiff, UK).

208	Professor Evans Jeffry	University of Glasgow	2015-07-01	2020-06-30	Translational Cancer Therapeutics	BackgroundPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a poor prognosis and novel pre-clinical and clinical approaches are required to develop more effective strategies to treat pre-invasive, micro-metastatic, and advanced disease. We have developed a number of novel genetically-engineered murine models (and cell lines from these tumours) that have allowed us to understand the biological function of key tumour suppressor genes and oncogenes in vivo in both normal tissues and tumours, allowed us to identify and characterise the signalling pathways that are deregulated at the early stages of pancreatic cancer, during the development and progression of the invasive and metastatic phenotype, and that are potential therapeutic targets in advanced disease. AimsThe aim of our work is to determine how potential anti-cancer agents might best be evaluated in subsequent clinical trials in PDAC. Specifically, we will (a) investigate key pathways downstream of KRAS to develop therapies in advanced disease. We will focus on the mTOR pathway, to explore which downstream targets are important for tumour cell survival and proliferation, identify in which genetic backgrounds that target inhibition will have most efficacy, and to pre-clinically test inhibitors and combinatorial approaches(b) optimize therapy in localised disease by targeting myeloid cells to suppress metastasis and to improve immunotherapy. We will investigate the key immune cell types and signals in the PDAC microenvironment and how they impinge on immune suppression, and assess how best to modulate tumour immunity in vivo, with regards to rational combinations. Initially, we will focus on inhibition of CXCR2 or CSF1R to enhance T-cell tumour infiltration and increases anti-PD1 efficacy.MethodsWe will use clinically relevant inhibitors, shRNA or CRISPR / Cas9 technology to inhibit candidate targets in cell lines from appropriate mouse models. Analysis by qPCR or immunoblotting will be performed to validate the mechanism of action of successful candidates and to identify companion biomarkers for future clinical studies. We will use our mouse models for genetic validation and to assess the efficacy of candidate therapies or combinations, using PET imaging to assess therapeutic efficacy with regard to tumour metabolism and proliferation where relevant. We will identify potential genotype-specific biomarker signatures in murine models and confirm the clinical relevance of these in human tissue microarrays, which can then be used to guide patient selection in subsequent clinical studies.We will use the results of these studies to develop clinical trials in patients with PDAC.

209	Dr Zelenay Santiago	University of Manchester	2015-08-01	2022-07-31	Manchester Immunology Group	Identification and characterisation of mediators of tumour promoting or inhibitory inflammation: The notion of immune-based control of cancer has historically been controversial but has gained great support from the remarkable clinical success of certain types of immunotherapy over the past few years. This is certainly the case of melanoma, where some patients have shown complete and durable responses upon treatment with immune checkpoint blocking antibodies. Also promising results were obtained in treatment-refractory cancers such as metastatic non-small-cell lung carcinoma, a type of cancer that until recently was considered as unresponsive to immunotherapy. Nevertheless, in all cases, only a fraction of patients responds underscoring the need for mechanistic studies to determine why this is the case. Indeed, how tumours evade natural and therapy-induced immune responses is a long-standing question in cancer biology. The concept that cancer induces inflammation and that inflammatory cells at the tumour site promote several key aspects of malignant tumours such as proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis or migration, is well established. On the other hand, some types of inflammation such as the one characterised by T cell infiltration, particularly by cytotoxic T cells, are associated with a favourable prognosis and clinical benefit. Moreover, effective anti-tumour immunity depends on inflammatory mediators that contribute to the activation of immune cells such as dendritic cells. Together, these observations indicate that cancer-associated inflammation can have both tumour-promoting and inhibitory effects. How different types of inflammation are manipulated by a growing tumour and to what extent this constitutes an opportunity for therapeutic intervention remains incompletely explored. In this context, our group investigates the mechanisms by which cancer cells trigger the immune system and simultaneously evade anti-tumour immunity. The aim of this project will be to identify and characterise factors that modulate the function of immune cells such as dendritic cells in the tumour microenvironment, distinguishing mediators promoting anti-tumour immunity from those that support tumour growth. Building on from our recent work (Zelenay et al. Cell 2015), the successful candidate will evaluate how specific genetic mutations in cancer cells impact in their ability to modulate the recruitment and function of immune cells through a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches. These will include implementing CRISPR-Cas9 technology for genome editing of cancer cells bearing defined combinations of oncogenic mutations, the use of genetically-engineered transplantable and autochthonous mouse models of cancer and the analysis of samples from cancer patients.

They are also linked to pathological conditions, such as cancer and viral infections. Filopodia consist of actin filaments that are spatially organized into bundles by actin bundling proteins. Various combinations of bundling proteins are expressed in different cell types, but their specific function and potential redundancy has remained enigmatic. Many actin-regulating proteins in filopodia and other cellular compartments have been studied on the cellular level, examining their influence on cell morphology and dynamics. Understanding filopodial proteins at an ultra-structural level in their native context is another promising approach to deciphering their role. However, for most proteins structural in situ information is unavailable, due to experimental challenges. Our proposal aims to reveal the detailed function and redundancy of actin filament bundlers in filopodia across scales, from the cellular level, down to the scale of individual proteins. We want to correlate protein structure with its role in cell morphology and filopodial morphodynamics, all within the same experimental system. We will generate CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic knockouts of Fascin1, Daam1 and Fimbrin in B16-F1 cells and characterise them on the cellular and ultrastructural level. Live imaging microscopy and sophisticated image analysis will reveal changes in morphodynamical parameters upon knocking out proteins. Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) is a powerful method to provide three-dimensional insights into complex cellular environments, and will be performed to acquire the ultrastructure of filopodia. This will reveal how the density and distribution of filopodial proteins and the actin network organization is affected upon loss of the targeted proteins. Novel image processing techniques (i.e. subtomogram averaging) will be then used to retrieve high-resolution structural information on filopodial proteins within their native environment. Acquiring high-resolution structural information on proteins in their native environment and linking this to morphodynamical parameters will be a significant breakthrough towards a holistic cellular structural biology approach. The project will significantly advance our knowledge on filopodia formation, maintenance and the functional redundancy of bundling proteins. The applicant Georgi Dimchev is an expert in studying actin-mediated cell migration using cell biology methods and imaging techniques. His expertise perfectly complements that within the research group of Florian Schur (co-applicant) at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria, where the applicant intends to address the above-mentioned questions. The Schur lab employs and develops correlative live-cell imaging, cryo-ET and subtomogram averaging methods to study the structure of the actin cytoskeleton in situ.

However, the full scope of benefits that these systems can provide, as well as their costs remain unknown. Specifically, it is unclear whether the benefits against viral infection outweigh the continual costs incurred even in the absence of parasitic elements, and whether CRISPR-Cas systems affect microbial genome diversity in nature. Since CRISPR-Cas systems can impede lateral gene transfer, it is often assumed that they reduce genetic diversity. Conversely, our recent results suggest the exact opposite: that these systems generate a high level of genomic diversity within populations. We have recently combined genomics of environmental strains and experimental genetics to show that archaea frequently acquire CRISPR immune memory, known as spacers, from chromosomes of related species in the environment. The presence of these spacers reduces gene exchange between lineages, indicating that CRISPR-Cas contributes to diversification. We have also shown that such inter-species mating events induce the acquisition of spacers against a strain's own replicons, supporting a role for CRISPR-Cas systems in generating deletions in natural plasmids and unessential genomic loci, again increasing genome diversity within populations. Here we aim to test our hypothesis that CRISPR-Cas systems increase within-population diversity, and quantify their benefits to both cells and populations, using large-scale genomics and experimental evolution. We will explore how these systems alter the patterns of recombination within and between species, and explore the potential involvement of CRISPR-associated proteins in cellular DNA repair. This work will reveal the eco-evolutionary role of CRISPR-Cas systems in shaping microbial populations, and open new research avenues regarding additional roles beyond anti-viral defense.

Recent advances in gene therapy research forecast a bright future for IRD treatment. Retina has distinct advantages for gene therapy because of its small confined space, easy accessibility by surgery, and immune privilege. The FDA in the US has recently approved the first ever gene therapy for treating an IRD (by overexpression of the normal gene). But this popular gene supplementation approach has its weaknesses, e.g. the co-existing influence of the mutant gene and therefore is not suitable for all IRDs. The newly emerged CRISPR/Cas9 technology enables highly specific in-situ gene editing, heralding a new era for developing gene therapy for IRDs. Cacna1f gene encodes a retina abundant Cav1.4 channel protein and mutations in this gene can cause the incomplete congenital stationary night blindness (iCSNB) in human. My current lab identified a spontaneous single mutation in rat Cacna1f gene responsible for iCSNB-like phenotypes in rats. We tested gene supplementation therapy in these rats by overexpressing the wild type Cacna1f gene in the retina, but detected no significant change in visual function. Therefore we will next turn to the CRISPR/Cas9 technology for Cacna1f gene correction. In this proposed project, taking advantage of the UK co-applicantâs extensive experience in mouse gene manipulation, we aim to examine the feasibility and efficacy of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Cacna1f gene correction in Cav1.4 IT mice, which feature a CACNA1F-I756T mutation and reflect very well the functional phenotype seen in human patients with a corresponding CACNA1F-I745T mutation. We will make AAV-based Cas9 and sgRNA constructs designed to cleave target DNA near the genomic site corresponding to CACNA1F-I756T and assess them in 3T3 cells to find the most efficient CRISPR/Cas9 system for DNA cleavage. We will further evaluate CRISPR/Cas9-mediated precise gene editing in 3T3 cells using a donor template of Cacna1f containing an edit. Then we will construct a donor template of wild type Cacna1f (of the same design as the one above) for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene correction in the retina of Cav1.4 IT mice. We will also use a donor template of Cacna1f containing an insertion of Tdtom cassette for easy examination of gene editing efficiency. If acquired data are promising, we will further assess the therapeutic effect of the above gene correction in Cav1.4 IT mice.

The cells of the blastocyst are capable of generating all adult cell types, a phenomenon known as pluripotency. The inner cell mass (ICM) of the blastocyst can moreover be cultured in a dish as pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs). ESCs have become invaluable tools in regenerative medicine and to study development itself. With 1 in 8 couples experiencing infertility in the UK, it is ever more important to understand the factors contributing to healthy embryo development. Transposable elements (TEs) are parts of our DNA that are currently or historically mobile, -i.e. having the capacity to 'paste' themselves into new places in the genome. Many TE sequences used to be thought of as simply 'junk DNA'; however, we are beginning to understand that TEs have evolved to play new and unexpected roles in development and disease. For example, uncontrolled TE activity has been implicated in neurodegeneration and cancer. However, the expression of many TEs is also high in normal development, suggesting that they may also have beneficial roles in cells. This proposal focuses on exploring the function and regulation of a particular TE, called mouse endogenous retrovirus type L, MERVL. MERVL is the earliest expressed TE, and is transiently upregulated in mouse embryos at the 2-cell stage. This stage, conserved in human in 4-8 cell embryos, encompasses an essential process called Zygotic Genome Activation, when the embryo begins to turn on its own genes for the first time. These embryos are also considered "totipotent", meaning that they can not only generate embryonic tissues but also extra-embryonic tissues (like placenta). Interestingly, a small proportion of ESCs transiently become "2C-like" in normal culture, also possessing enhanced developmental potency. Here, we will use mouse ESCs and mouse embryos to investigate how and why MERVL regulation is important in early development. Using these tools, we will identify and characterize key factors required to activate and repress MERVL. In turn, we will investigate how these factors regulate the 2-cell stage, and affect ZGA and totipotency. To understand how MERVL and other TEs are directly regulated, we will combine genome-editing systems, called CRISPR/Cas9, with recent biochemical tools to pull out sets of proteins that bind MERVL. Lastly, we will explore the conservation of MERVL function and regulation in human cells, where a similar TE, HERVL, is known to play a conserved role. We aim to a) understand how HERVL regulates the 4-8 cell stage and human ZGA b) investigate how new HERVL regulators might contribute to specific cases of disease. These studies will significantly increase our understanding of how TEs contribute to early development, and will shed insight on how such processes are perturbed in disease.

Although most cancer immunotherapies aim at re-activating T cells, targeting natural killer (NK) cells is attracting growing attention, as NK cells are at the forefront of anti-tumor responses. However, the euphoria from recent successes stemming from the infusion of pre-activated NK cells into tumor patients is tempered by the fact that some tumor cells adapt to the constant pressure imposed by the bodyâs immune system. This concept of âimmunoeditingâ has been convincingly shown in experimental models of chemically induced tumors but whether and how it applies in other malignancies is still a matter of debate. We hypothesize that immunoediting takes place in natural tumors. There is unequivocal evidence for the importance of NK cells in the fight against leukemia and novel therapies using the adoptive transfer of cytokine-induced NK cells are highly successful. We thus choose leukemia as a model system to address whether NK cell-mediated immunoediting takes place. Our study design will allow two potential scenarios to be distinguished: (i) NK cells are able to kill highly immunogenic cell clones but spare pre-existing resistant sub-clones (clonal selection) or (ii) NK cells shape tumor immunogenicity by classical immunoediting. Our approach will also allow us to determine the molecular mechanisms of tumor evasion from NK cell-mediated eradication. This will be achieved by means of a cellular barcoding system that allows single leukemic cells to be tracked in vivo. The combination of cellular barcoding and next generation sequencing will enable us to determine the transcriptional changes in NK cell-resistant leukemic cell clones. Finally, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene modification will be used to identify driver mutations responsible for tumor evasion and to validate our findings. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor immune evasion is the first step towards utilizing the full potential of NK cells in anti-tumor therapy. Ultimately, the study will pave the way for new therapeutic approaches to treat tumors that have successfully evaded the immune system. The study will be supervised by the applicant Eva Maria KÃ¶nig and the laboratory work will be performed by a PhD student at the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, supported by the applicant. Stratification of NGS data will be supported by a part time bioinformatician.	Austrian Science Fund FWF	01 Stand-Alone Projects	341760.3EUR

I will perform functional characterization of RA risk loci with the aim of translating GWAS findings into biological disease mechanisms and suggesting therapeutic targets. My key goals are: 1. To identify the genes that cause RA. I will identify chromatin interactions between RA loci and their targets using capture Hi-C in primary CD4+ T-cells and synovial fibroblasts from RA patients. I will explore whether associated SNP genotypes are correlated with differential expression of the genes they interact with. 2. To elucidate the mechanism by which RA-associated SNPs alter their target genes. Regulatory elements containing disease-associated SNPs will be identified in primary cells from patients and their functional importance will be verified using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. 3. To translate research findings into patient benefit.

225	Dr. DORARD-CAHENZLI Coralie	University of Vienna	2018-08-01	2021-07-31	Role of RAF1 in colorectal carcinogenesis in 3D models	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer world-wide and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in developed countries. In spite of permanent improvements in surgery and chemotherapeutic treatments, cancer relapse remains frequent, and around 50% of patients die within five years following the initial diagnosis. This emphasizes the need for a better understanding of cancer biology as a prerequisite towards finding new and more effective therapies. Two major groups of CRC had been described: those displaying MicroSatellite Instability (MSI) (10-15%) and those that are microsatellite stable but chromosomally unstable (CIN) (85-90%). The MAPK pathway, a conserved signaling cascade implicated in many cellular processes connected with tumorigenesis, is frequently deregulated in CRC, often due to the presence of activating KRAS mutations (40% of CRC). Unfortunately, KRAS-driven CRC is resistant to most treatments, and a full understanding of the biological mechanisms downstream of mutated KRAS is essential for the development of new targeted therapies. Studies in RAS-driven tumors in animal models have shown essential roles of the RAS effectors RAF, which can be dependent or independent of their ability to activate the MEK/ERK module. In particular, the RAF paralog RAF1 exerts unique essential functions in the control of apoptosis, cell migration, cell-cell adhesion and differentiation. Sporadic evidence in the literature suggest potential roles of RAF1 in CRC which are dependent of its kinase activity but MEK-independent. With this background in mind, we plan to systematically investigate the role of RAF1 in KRAS-driven CRC. To this aim, we will use 3D models (spheroids and human organoids), which better reflect in vivo tumors, to define the role of RAF1 in KRAS-induced CRC with MSI or MSS (microsatellite stable) backgrounds. We will start by characterizing the biological processes impacted by RAF1 ablation (generated by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing) or inducible silencing (by Tet-inducible shRNA). To decipher the underlying mechanisms, a candidate and unbiased approaches will be deployed, and the identified targets will be validated in rescue experiments 3D models. The results obtained will identify new RAF1-related vulnerabilities in CRC which could pave the road for the design of new targeted therapies. This project will be done in the lab of Univ.-Prof. Dr. Manuela Baccarini, who has a strong expertise in cell signaling and knock-out/knock-down approaches. The project will be performed in collaboration with Dr Helmut Dolznig (Medical University of Vienna, Austria) who is experienced in 3D CRC models and with Dr Alex Duval (CdR Saint-Antoine, Paris, France), who is an expert in colorectal cancer genetics and especially MSI tumors. Dr Mathew Garnett (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK), will provide us human CRC organoids and its expertise in this field.	Austrian Science Fund FWF	None	234210.0EUR

It has similar functional requirements even in evolutionarily divergent pathogens. These include the mutually exclusive expression of antigens and the periodic, nonrandom switching in the expression of different antigens during the course of an infection. Despite decades of research the mechanisms of antigenic variation are not fully understood in any organism. The recent development of high-throughput sequencing-based assays to probe the 3D genome architecture (Hi-C) has revealed the importance of the spatial organization of DNA inside the nucleus. 3D genome architecture plays a critical role in the regulation of mutually exclusive gene expression and the frequency of translocation between different genomic loci in many eukaryotes. Thus, genome architecture may also be a key regulator of antigenic variation, yet the causal links between genome architecture and the expression of antigens have not been studied systematically. In addition, the development of CRISPR-Cas9-based approaches to perform nucleotide-specific genome editing has opened unprecedented opportunities to study the influence of DNA sequence elements on the spatial organization of DNA and how this impacts antigen expression. I have adapted both Hi-C and CRISPR-Cas9 technology to the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, one of the most important model organisms to study antigenic variation. These techniques will enable me to bridge the field of antigenic variation research with that of genome architecture. I will perform the first systematic analysis of the role of genome architecture in the mutually exclusive and hierarchical expression of antigens in any pathogen. The experiments outlined in this proposal will provide new insight, facilitating a new view of antigenic variation and may eventually help medical intervention in T. brucei and in other pathogens relying on antigenic variation for their survival.

I have recently shown a disproportionate large contribution from low-frequency genetic variants in ALS. ALS is not simply a collection of unique rare diseases with a monogenetic cause nor is it a diagnostic continuum with a complex contribution of thousands of small effect factors. ALS is in-between, which I call âsimplexâ, where in each patient a few, considerably strong genetic factors with or without environmental factors are at play. ALS mutations are characterized by reduced penetrance, variable clinical expressivity, have specific pleiotropic clinical features and interact with environmental factors. These phenomena are unexplained, but provide me with important and new opportunities in order to unravel the clinical, genetic and biological heterogeneity in ALS. I have created new research fields to go an important step beyond the state of the art: Splitting by lumping uses novel machine learning algorithms to reclassify patients using clinical pleiotropic features, environmental factors and blood epigenetic profiles to identify novel ALS mutations. Imaging genomics overlays patterns in ALS-associated brain morphology on MRI with brain gene-expression patterns to find ALS mutations. ALS risk in 3D integrates data on three-dimensional folding of DNA with genetic data to identify causal mutations and mutation-to-mutation interaction. ALS genomic modifiers in 3D identifies modifiers of C9orf72 mutations through the development of cellular reporter assays and CRISPR-Cas9 based screens. Genomic findings are translated using cellular models which can be used for targeted and unbiased drug screens. If successful, my approaches can be applied beyond the scope of this ERC and will have a clear impact on clinical trial design and genetic counselling in ALS in particular.

Recent literature suggests that microglia, which mediate synaptic pruning during brain development, can be responsible for synapse loss in neurodegeneration. Although the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, growing evidence indicates that dysfunctional microglia affect synapses number and function in pathology. Genome-wide association studies reveal that the majority of risk genes associated with neurodegenerative disorders are highly expressed in microglia. While such studies clearly implicate these cells in the pathogenesis of the disease, little is known about the causal mechanisms that link microglial risk variants to loss of synapses. We will identify the molecular mechanisms involved in microglia-mediated synapse loss. We will also generate novel in vitro and ex vivo models of ârisk microgliaâ, by introducing genetic variants associated with cognitive impairment âalone or in combination- specifically in microglia, taking advantage of CRISPR/ Cas9 genome editing techniques. These goals will be achieved by combining cutting-edge transcriptomics and proteomics with mouse models of intense synaptic remodelling, to reveal the unique molecular signature of âshaper microgliaâ. A multidisciplinary approach will allow the extensive characterisation of risk models, by combining metabolic analysis, synaptic phagocytosis and degradation assays, with super-resolution microscopy, and novel genetically encoded labelling methods. With the knowledge generated here, we aim at developing and validating in vivo novel drugs- and nanobodies-based approaches for effective targeting of pathological pruning. In summary, REMIND will focus on: 1) Identifying molecular players in microglial-mediated synapse loss 2) Generating ârisk microgliaâ models, to asses the role of genetic variants associated with neurodegeneration 3) Developing novel strategies for targeting prunining	European Research Council	Starting Grant	1499991.0EUR
230	Mr Johansen Kristoffer	University of Cambridge	2016-10-01	2020-09-30	Signaling by novel PI3K effector proteins in T cells	The proposed research project seeks to describe and characterise the roles of novel PIP3-binding proteins in T cells by knocking out PIP3-binding proteins identified during a RNAseq screen with CRISPR/Cas9 in T cell lines, primary T cells, and eventually in vivo in mouse models. By using functional assays, such as ICAM-binding assays, intracellular IFN&gamma; staining, and APC-T cell conjugation assays, the identified proteins will be characterized. Key goals of the project will be: 1) To establish techniques for knocking out the identified PIP3-binding proteins in primary Tcells. 2) To functionally analyse the knockout T cells from goal 1 and identify novel PIP-binding proteins with roles in T cell migration, adhesion, or activation. 3) To investigate a select few novel PIP3-binding proteins in vivo either by bone marrow reconstitution with KO cells, T cell transfer models, or complete conditional knockout as established with CRISPR/Cas9 at the Babraham Institute.I expect that we will help elucidate on the signalling pathways involved in T cell function, and thereby potentially gain knowledge on proteins downstream in the PI3K signalling pathway that potentially could be pharmaceutical targets in cancers, autoimmune, and infectious diseases.

232	Mr Byrne Dwayne	University of Lausanne	2016-12-01	2018-11-30	The Genomic Basis of Life History Adaptation	Life history traits are central to our understanding of adaptation because they represent direct targets of selection. However, while much progress has been made in uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying fitness-related traits, mainly by studying large-effect mutants in model organisms, little is known about naturally occurring genetic variants that affect these traits. The central aim of my current SNSF Professorship grant is to identify naturally occurring polymorphisms that underlie evolutionary changes in life history, using Drosophila melanogaster as a model. Over the last 33 months, we have used two complementary approaches to tackle this problem: to generate 'catalogs' of candidate variants we have applied whole-genome Pool-sequencing to (1) North American populations clinally differentiated for life history and (2) a >30-year-long artificial selection experiment for longevity. Both approaches are 'designed' to maximize among-population life-history differentiation and thus to increase our ability to map life-history variants via sequencing. In a second step, we have begun to perform experiments to examine the life-history effects of some of these candidate mechanisms. Based on our genomic analyses, we have prioritized three candidate mechanisms for experiments: (1) for the cline, we have identified clinal SNP polymorphisms in several genes involved in insulin signaling, a pathway known from molecular studies to regulate life-history physiology, including a clinal 2-SNP polymorphism in the transcription factor gene foxo; (2) a clinal chromosomal inversion polymorphism, In(3R)Payne, to which 79% of the most strongly clinal SNPs in the genome map; and (3), in the selection experiment, we have found strong enrichment of immunity genes among our top candidates. To date, our experiments show that (1) the foxo polymorphism has major pleiotropic on egg-to-adult survival, body size and starvation resistance, in assays based on synthetic recombinant inbred lines; (2) the In(3R)Payne polymorphism is maintained by clinal selection, independent of neutrality and admixture, and affects body size, a strongly clinal trait; and (3) the long-lived selection lines survive pathogenic infections much better than the controls. In this application for a 2-year extension of my grant, we propose to follow up on these promising leads. First, to better understand how the foxo polymorphism affects life history, we will use homologous replacement of the 2 SNPs (and their allelic combinations) into a common background via CRISPR/Cas9, in collaboration with Alistair McGregor (Oxford); we will measure additive and epistatic effects of these constructs on life history and FOXO activity. Second, to identify targets of selection within In(3R)Payne, we will phase-sequence isochromosomal lines and apply ABC-based coalescent models to the data, in collaboration with Mark Kirkpatrick (Austin). In addition, we will perform RNA-seq of standard vs. inverted lines to uncover transcriptional differences between inversion karyotypes. Finally, to begin to uncover the regulatory details of the intriguing but poorly understood connection between lifespan and immunity in the longevity selection lines, we will assay transcriptional responses to infection in selection versus control lines, both in young and old flies, and - secondly - test whether silencing immune genes via transgenic RNAi affects lifespan, as hypothesized. Together, this integrative approach - spanning population genomics, functional genetics, and physiology - will significantly advance our understanding of the molecular basis of adaptive changes in life history and aging, a fundamental but largely unresolved problem in evolutionary biology.

234	Prof. BOERJAN Wout	VIB VZW	2019-07-01	2024-06-30	Large-scale identification of secondary metabolites, metabolic pathways and their genes in the model tree poplar	Poplar is an important woody biomass crop and at the same time the model of choice for molecular research in trees. Although there is steady progress in resolving the functions of unknown genes, the identities of most secondary metabolites in poplar remain unknown. The lack of metabolite identities in experimental systems is a true gap in information content, and impedes obtaining deep insight into the complex biology of living systems. The main reason is that metabolites are difficult to purify because of their low abundance, hindering their structural characterization and the discovery of their biosynthetic pathways. In this project, we will use CSPP, an innovative method recently developed in my lab, to systematically predict the structures of metabolites along with their biosynthetic pathways in poplar wood, bark and leaves. This CSPP method is based on a combination of metabolomics and informatics. In a next step, the CSPP tool will be combined with two complementary genetic approaches based on re-sequence data from 750 poplar trees to identify the genes encoding the enzymes in the predicted pathways. Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) will be made to identify SNPs in the genes involved in the metabolic conversions. Subsequently, rare defective alleles will be identified for these genes in the sequenced population. Genes identified by both approaches will then be further studied either by crossing natural poplars that are heterozygous for the defective alleles, or by CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing in poplar. The functional studies will be further underpinned by enzyme assays. Given our scarce knowledge on the structure of most secondary metabolites and their metabolic pathways in poplar, this large-scale identification effort will lay the foundation for systems biology research in this species, and will shape opportunities to further develop poplar as an industrial wood-producing crop.

The most abundant modification known is RNA-editing by adenine to inosine deamination, found in all classes of RNAs but rRNAs. Editing is essential, as deletions of the responsible deaminases ADAR1 or ADAR2 are lethal in mice. Mutations in ADAR1 cause aberrant sensing of self-RNAs leading to the autoinflammatory Aicardi-GoutiÃ¨res syndrome. Inosines are interpreted as guanosines. Thus, editing can recode mRNAs or retarget microRNAs. For instance, the mRNAs encoding Filamin-a (FLNA) and Filamin-b (FLNB) undergo a glutamine to arginine recoding in their C-termini. FLNA editing levels vary across tissues, reaching almost 90% in the gut. Besides a link to smooth muscle cell contraction consequences of FLNA editing are largely unknown. Our preliminary data show that RNA-editing ameliorates inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colon cancer. In the gut host and microbiota constantly communicate, partially by secreted microRNAs but also by RNA modifications. Thus, RNA-modifications will regulate and affect the host-fecal microbiota crosstalk also impacting IBD. We could already demonstrate an altered microbiome in FLNA editing deficient mice. Organism-wide RNA-editing can suppress inflammation by inhibiting the RNA sensor MDA5. Potentially, also other MDA5 related helicases are involved in modification-dependent protection from hyperinflammation. Here, we aim to study the role of FLNA mRNA editing in IBD and cancer and the impact of microRNA editing and modifications on the host-microbiota crosstalk. Lastly, the role of helicases in discriminating self vs. non-self RNA will be investigated. Results will advance the field of epitranscriptomic research and potentially serve as a basis to diagnose or treat IBD and colon cancer. The questions will be addressed using a wide spectrum of methods. State-of-the-art mouse models of IBD and cancer will be combined with microbiota analysis in rescued ADAR knockout mice and mice expressing constitutively edited/unedited FLNA. Transcriptomics will identify key edited or overexpressed microRNAs, which will be further explored by generating mice with inducible, tissue-specific editing by CRISPR/Cas9, a completely novel approach. Finally, the involvement of RNA helicases in the ADAR1-MDA5 axis will be explored by an innovative CRISPR screen. The involved researchers have highly complementary expertise.

GLUT4 traffics through multiple compartments to reach specialised storage vesicles (GSV) from where it can be recruited to the plasma membrane upon insulin stimulation. Trafficking events involving sorting GLUT4 and other cargo proteins from a late endosomal compartment back into the recycling pool are essential for the formation of the GSV. Retromer and the newly discovered retriever complexes play a role in late-endosomal sorting. In this study, we propose to explore the potential role of the retriever complex in GSV formation. We have generated clonal knockout 3T3-L1 cell lines, using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, lacking Vps29 (common to both retromer and retriever complexes), Vps35 (unique to retromer) and Vps35L/C16orf62 (unique to retriever). We have confirmed the knockout status of the clones, performed some preliminary analysis and will further characterise them to determine phenotype in the absence of these proteins. Using a range of cell-biology and biochemistry techniques, we will determine for the first time whether the retriever complex affects GLUT4 sorting to GSVs and its translocation to the plasma membrane in response to insulin stimulation and facilitate glucose uptake.

240	Univ.-Prof ZOTCHEV Sergey	University of Vienna	2019-11-01	2023-10-31	Novel bacterial metabolites via synthetic biology	Wider research context: Bacterial secondary metabolites represent a treasure trove for drug discovery (e.g. antibiotics, anti-cancer and immunomodulating agents etc), and provide new insight into the natural product biosynthesis. However, many bacteria harbor secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters (BGCs) that are not expressed under laboratory conditions, and thus their products cannot be purified and characterized. Synthetic biology is a new scientific discipline that applies engineering principles to biological systems with the aim of improving them or building novel ones. Synthetic biology approaches can be used to re-engineer (refactor) silent biosynthetic genes in such a way, that they can be expressed in heterologous hosts, leading to production of previously undiscovered secondary metabolites. Research question and objectives: SynBioBac project intends to address the challenge of âwakingâ silent biosynthetic genes in bacteria by using synthetic biology principles and tools. Correspondingly, the objectives include cloning of selected BGCs, their disassembly and refactoring with new regulatory elements, development of tools for activation of gene expression and sensing of produced secondary metabolites, expression of refactored BGCs in several heterologous bacterial hosts, followed by purification and characterization of novel secondary metabolites. Methods: Construction of representative gene libraries followed by screening; assembly of complete BGCs in yeast (transformation-associated recombination); BGCs disassembly using a combination of PCR and restriction digests; refactoring in yeast with new regulatory elements with help of CRISPR/Cas system; construction of activator and biosensor devices; expression in pre-engineered bacterial hosts; identification of metabolites with high-resolution mass spectrometry; purification and structure elucidation with NMR; testing for biological activities. Level of originality: The project goes well beyond current state-of-the-art, since it develops and tests an original synthetic biology-based approach to âwakingâ silent bacterial genes for biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. It is intended to provide a roadmap for drug discovery that can be applied to virtually any bacterial species, and may in itself discover novel bioactive natural products with applied potential.

This disease is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator gene (CFTR) which produces defective ion fluxes and calcium homeostasis in the epithelia. Patients with cystic fibrosis are therefore susceptible to recurrent and lethal lung infections including those caused by the fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. Animal models play a central role in the study of cystic fibrosis. Researchers have used mice, ferrets, pigs and sheep to model the inflammatory response seen in human patients with this disease. Although such models generate useful knowledge on the pathophysiology of this disease, animal models are limited for a number of reasons. One is the ethical concerns about the numbers of mice that needed to generate gene or tissue specific knock-outs which likely die early after birth. Additionally, mice, the most common vertebrate animal used, do not completely recapitulate the disease phenotypes seen in the human lung during infection and larger vertebrate such as sheep, pigs and ferrets are often used instead. The use of larger animals intrinsically have a number of limitations including housing space, high cost of the experimentations and the need to use very high number of animals to get enough statistical significance. In vitro cell culture systems using immortalised cystic fibrosis epithelial cells from donors have been developed to overcome those problems. However, genetic variability between healthy immortalised and cystic fibrosis cell lines prevents precise and statically useful comparison of events in CF and control cells which has limited them to be widely adopted by the community. Here we propose to establish a new in vitro model of isogenic cystic fibrosis and healthy controls bronchial epithelial cell lines carrying different CF mutations in the CFTR gene using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis of 16HBE bronchial cells. Using an established methodological approach developed in our laboratory including in vitro infection, confocal microscopy, expression analysis, cytokine measurements and competitive fitness analysis the student will be able to define critical stages of the interaction between the cystic fibrosis epithelia and A. fumigatus compared to healthy cells and the fungal factors governing this process. The successful completion of this project will achieve a number of scientific objectives. Firstly, the development of an isogenic cell culture system of epithelial cell lines will be of great value for researchers focused on the study of epithelia-pathogen interactions in cystic fibrosis without using any mice. Secondly, screening of A. fumigatus null libraries on CF epithelia will increase our knowledge on the pathogen factors leading persistence in the context of disease. Additionally, the student will be enrolled in a 3Rs focused programme that will give him/her the opportunity to enrol with industrial partners in Manchester and our fungal community to promote the implementation on this resource in other laboratories at an international level. As a PhD studentship we will also provide extensive training opportunities for a student, and the wider research community, on the importance of alternatives to replace animal testing.

Muscular dystrophies are a group of debilitating inherited diseases, characterised by progressive skeletal muscle wasting, followed by accumulation of fat and connective tissue. Current standards of care do not provide effective treatment, and can only delay loss of ambulation, cardiac and respiratory problems. Some muscular dystrophies cause premature death. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common and currently incurable neuromuscular disorder. Numerous animal models have been developed for DMD, including the most commonly used mdx/dmd mice and larger animals, such as dogs and pigs. However, the mdx/dmd mice do not fully recapitulate human pathophysiology. Unfortunately, many drugs that could ameliorate phenotypes in mdx/dmd mice fail to show efficacy in clinical trials. To replace/reduce the use of mouse models in muscular dystrophy research, we propose to develop human-specific, physiology-relevant in vitro models that can be exploited for elucidating disease mechanisms and testing drug candidates for developing novel therapies. However, human primary myoblasts lose myogenicity after extensive expansion in culture and lack isogenic control cells for comparison. To overcome these challenges, we generated two iPSC lines from two patients with distinct DMD mutations. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, we precisely corrected the DMD mutations to obtain two CRISPR-corrected iPSC lines as isogenic controls. Following a transgene-free myogenic differentiation protocol, the isogenic pairs of iPSC lines were differentiated to myogenic progenitors, resembling human primary muscle precursor cells. Terminal differentiation of human iPSCs-derived myogenic progenitors formed multinucleated, striated myofibers. Full-length dystrophin expression was completely restored in the CRISPR-corrected muscle cells. As standard 3D culture does not reflect the complexity of highly aligned myofiber architecture in vivo, we propose to employ novel bioengineering technologies to bridge this gap. We will use 3D bio-printing to fabricate human iPSC-derived skeletal muscle constructs, followed by characterisation of the biophysical and biological properties of the 3D bio-printed human skeletal muscle constructs. We will establish a range of disease-relevant functional assays by assessing isogenic pairs of bio-printed human 3D models, such as contractile force generation, response to chemical and electric stimulus, oxidative stress, as well as calcium handling. Finally, as proof of concept, we will test candidate drugs in our physiology-relevant 3D in vitro models to investigating their efficacy in ameliorating pathophysiological phenotypes. In brief, human iPSC-derived myogenic progenitors in combination with 3D bio-printing technologies can provide human-specific platforms critically needed for elucidating disease mechanisms and facilitating drug discovery. Importantly, our experimental paradigms are broadly applicable to any muscle disease. This multidisciplinary project will have a significant impact on developing novel human pre-clinical models and replacing/reducing the use of mouse models in muscular dystrophy research.

249	Dr. ENGLINGER Bernhard	Medical University of Vienna	2019-04-01	2021-03-31	Single-cell RNA-sequencing of pediatric ependymoma	Scientific background and hypothesis of the project: Pediatric ependymoma constitutes a heterogeneous set of tumors affecting the neuroepithelial linings of the entire central nervous system. Especially high-grade subtypes are frequently refractory to chemotherapy and lead to poor overall outcomes for patients. Genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic profiling has revealed distinct molecular subgroups associated with high tumor aggressiveness, most frequently arising in children and adolescents. However, besides few exceptions, targetable oncogenic driver mutations and pathways still remain unidentified and molecular insights into ependymoma biology have yet resulted in only little progress in the clinical management of this disease. Thus, novel targets for systemic treatment of ependymoma urgently need to be identified. However, this endeavor is complicated by the rarity of this disease, its genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity, as well as the low abundance of recurrent genetic mutations, even in those subtypes exhibiting poor prognosis. One major shortcoming of the field is that the majority of current large-scale profiling is performed on bulk tumor tissue, obscuring its heterogenic make-up at single-cell level with regard to mutations/programs orchestrating key oncogenic proliferation, self-renewal, invasion, and chemo-resistance traits. Scientific innovation and originality of the proposed project: This project aims to interrogate the cellular architecture and the interplay between genetic mutations and transcriptional programs of ependymoma at unprecedented resolution, using single-cell transcriptomics. The leading expertise in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) in the applicantâs receiving institution will be leveraged to analyze single cells from fresh surgical specimen of the major molecular ependymoma subgroups. Matched patient-derived cell models will be used to functionally test putative targetable driver alterations identified by scRNA-seq, employing pharmacological or genome-editing technologies. Successful completion of this project will provide insight into ependymoma pathogenesis and to reveal novel oncogenic driver alterations of this disease at a resolution not achievable by conventional bulk tissue characterization. These insights are expected to catalyze the discovery of novel molecular targets for systemic ependymoma treatment to improve clinical management of this pediatric malignancy. Methods: Patient tumor specimen will be prepared and sorted as single-cell suspensions for full-length, whole-transcriptome scRNA-seq. Computational analysis tools will be used for bioinformatic work-up of intratumoral heterogeneity and to compare single-cell- with bulk tumor transcriptome/genomic- data. In vitro cultures of matched patient-derived cell models will be tested by pharmacological and CRISPR-Cas9-directed gene editing intervention. Primary responsible researchers of the project: Bernhard Englinger, PhD, the project applicant, will be the principal person conducting the proposed project. Mariella Filbin, MD, PhD, will be the project supervisor at the receiving institution (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston).

252	Dr. KEAYS David	The Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP)	2017-01-01	2019-12-31	The pathology of the Michelin tire baby syndrome	Circumferential skin creases Kunze type (CSC-KT) is a rare disease characterised by intellectual disability, circumferential skin creases, cleft palate, a reduction in brain size, and facial dysmorphism. It is colloquially known as the âMichelin tire baby syndromeâ. In collaboration with the Van Esch laboratory we have recently shown that this intriguing syndrome is caused by mutations in genes that encode for either EB2 or TUBB5. EB2 is a protein associated with the microtubule plus ends that is critical for apico-basal epithelial differentiation, whereas TUBB5 is a beta tubulin that is broadly expressed in the developing central nervous system. Our goal is to understanding how, at a molecular and cellular level, mutations in these two proteins lead to this usual human disease. It is our hypothesis that mutations that cause CSC-KT perturb the structure or function of the microtubule cytoskeleton, altering the proliferative output and/or survival of cells in the brain and skin. To explore this hypothesis we propose combining mouse genetics with state-of-the-art human cerebral organoids. We have four specific goals: (1) To define the expression pattern of TUBB5 and EB2 in the developing brain and skin using histological methods; (2) to generate a conditional Tubb5 (Y222F) and Eb2 (Q151X) knock in mouse mutants that recapitulate human disease causing mutations; (3) to characterise these new mouse mutants at a behavioural, anatomical and molecular level; and (4) to establish and characterise human TUBB5 (Q15K and Y222F) and EB2 (N68S and Q152X) cerebral organoids using embryonic stem cells/iPSC technology. To achieve these goals we will exploit the speed and efficiency of the CRISPR-Cas9 endonuclease-based gene targeting system to make our mouse models and organoids. The results of this study will provide insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms that cause CSC-KT, and shed light on a growing spectrum of disease states that are associated with the microtubule cytoskeleton.

Primary Ca2+ entry pathways into cells are Ca2+-release activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels. The two key limiting molecular players of this pathway are the stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), embedded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Orai1, the Ca2+ channel in the cell membrane. In the present project, my team and I, Mag. Dr. Irene Frischauf, functionally evaluate the role of previously unknown, disease-related mutations of STIM1 in human Ca2+-homeostasis. Besides the important physiological functions of these proteins, growing evidence suggests a key role of CRAC channels in cancer development. STIM1 mutations evaluated here either derive from large-scale, human cancer-genomics data or from patients with tubular aggregate myopathy (TAM). Systematically, we screen for gain-of-function (GOF) STIM1 mutants using a Ca2+ imaging technique as well as an NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) reporter assay. Identified pre-activated STIM1 mutants, exhibiting altered Ca2+/NFAT signalling, are further functionally characterized by the whole-cell patch-clamp technique for their impact on selectivity and gating of CRAC channels which will also identify loss-of-function (LOF) mutations. In cooperation with the University of Nove Hrady (Prof. RÃ¼diger Ettrich, Academy of the Czech Republic), we perform molecular dynamics simulations with selected STIM1 mutants to signpost subsequent experiments focusing on possible structural rearrangements that occur in constitutively active proteins. As physiological STIM1 activation is tightly controlled by Ca2+, we specify domains necessary for Ca2+-dependent oligomerization in STIM1. Via a systematic crosslinking approach, crucial residues within STIM1 are revealed that undergo conformational rearrangements upon its activation. To investigate the STIM1 disease-related mutants in their respective environment, we take advantage of CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited, endogenous STIM1 proteins in specific cancer cell lines (in cooperation with Prof. Martin Pichler, Research Unit of Non-Coding RNA and Genome Editing, Medical University of Graz) and monitor Ca2+-signalling and the pathophysiological impact on NFAT/MITF (microphthalmia associated factor)/TFEB (transcription factor EB)-regulated gene-expression. The results of this project determine key mechanistic steps in the STIM1 activation cascade, resolve functional mechanisms for Ca2+ homeostasis in human cancer cells and pave the way for the development of anticancer targets.

Heterogeneity within hematopoietic progenitor populations has considerably limited characterization and molecular understanding of lineage commitment in both health and disease. Advances in single-cell genomic technologies provide an extraordinary opportunity for unbiased and high resolution mapping of biological function and regulation. Recently we have developed an experimental and analytical method, termed massively parallel single-cell RNA-Seq (MARS-Seq), for unbiased classification of individual cells from their native context and successfully applied it for characterization of immune and hematopoietic progenitors. Here, we propose to uncover the hierarchy and regulatory mechanisms controlling hematopoiesis by combining comprehensive single-cell RNA-Seq analyses, modelling approaches, advanced functional assays, single-cell CRISPR screens, knockout models and epigenetic profiling. Exciting preliminary result show that indeed our approach is starting to uncover the complexity of hematopoietic progenitors and the regulatory circuits driving hematopoietic decisions. We will pursue the following aims: (i) Generate a refined model of hematopoiesis by comprehensive single-cell RNA-Seq profiling of hematopoietic progenitors, (ii) validate the predicted model by in vivo functional developmental assays and then (iii) test candidate transcription and chromatin factors uncovered by our model for their role in controlling progression towards various lineages using single-cell measurements combined with CRISPR screens. Together, our study is expected to generate a revised and high-resolution hematopoietic model and decipher the regulatory networks that control hematopoiesis. Our methods and models may provide a platform for future medical advancements including a large-scale European collaborative project to discover a comprehensive human hematopoietic tree.

Laboratory tests, often based on quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), require equipment, time, expertise and infrastructure, resulting in severe logistical challenges and ultimately resulting in inadequate testing. There is a critical need for diagnostics that can be rapidly deployed at the point-of-need (PON) to enable global surveillance of infectious diseases. Towards addressing this need, this project incorporates a new CRISPR-based approach called CRISPR Isothermal Amplification (CIA) that enables one-pot diagnostic amplification and detection of the SARC-CoV-2 virus at ambient temperatures. This scheme builds off innovations in cell-free synthetic biology and biosensing that enable rapid, low-cost, and PON detection of chemical contaminants and viral pathogens. The platform technology under development could serve several purposes from a quick-screen technology to inform triage and isolation strategies, to a clinical test used on the front lines. There is also the potential for the technology to eventually serve as an at-home test to help inform which subpopulations and sectors of the economy could safely return to productivity towards the end of the pandemic. In addition, the test has the flexibility to be rapidly reprogrammed to detect new emerging pathogens. This work is pursued in close collaboration with a commercial partner, Stemloop, Inc., in order to quickly transition the technology for manufacturing, deployment, and distribution.<br/><br/>This project employs a new CRISPR Isothermal Amplification (CIA) approach to enable a one-pot amplification and detection of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in an assay for the virus. CIA uses programmed Cas 13 systems to recognize SARS-CoV-2 RNA, trigger nucleic acid amplification and create a detectable output simultaneously in the same reaction where amplification occurs. Computational models of each process are developed alongside the experimental systems and used to guide optimizations to achieve attomolar sensitivity. The method is unique in that no DNA primers are required. The amplification and detection processes are designed to take less than one hour and cost less than one dollar per test to manufacture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Significance: Many childhood cancers exhibit widespread epigenetic aberrations, including changes in DNA methylation and in histone marks. This is in stark contrast to their low frequency of genetic defects, and it suggests an important functional role for epigenome deregulation in these cancers. I have recently described massive changes in histone acetylation and genome-wide enhancer reprogramming for Ewing sarcoma, a difficult-to-treat pediatric tumor. In this project, I will investigate the hypothesis that Ewing sarcoma is an enhancer disease, characterized by highly orchestrated reprogramming of genome-wide histone acetylation patterns. This work will advance our understanding of Ewing sarcoma and of the epigenomeâs role in pediatric cancers. It may also provide a molecular basis for pursuing epigenome editing and enhancer targeting and as new therapeutic strategies for Ewing sarcoma. Innovation: The proposed project focuses on a largely unexplored area of Ewing sarcoma research. Using the latest epigenome mapping technology, it will be possible to map and classify all enhancers that are driven by the oncogenic fusion protein EWS-FLI1. Furthermore, chromatin 3D mapping and bioinformatic analysis will connect the enhancers to their target genes genome-wide, and selected enhancer-gene links will be validated by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. I will also confirm the role of Ewing sarcoma specific enhancers in primary samples, using a cohort of 141 Ewing tumors for which I have already completed genome-wide DNA methylation sequencing. Approach: Aim 1. EWS-FLI1-driven enhancer landscape: Comprehensive mapping and integrative analysis of histone acetylation patterns and enhancer binding proteins in cells with tunable EWS-FLI1 expression Aim 2. Regulatory impact of EWS-FLI1-driven enhancers: Connecting Ewing sarcoma specific enhancers to their target genes via chromatin 3D structure mapping, CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, and enhancer RNA knockdown Aim 3. Enhancer activity in clinical samples: Correlating EWS-FLI1 driven enhancer activity to patient-specific gene expression profiles and clinical outcome in primary Ewing sarcoma tumors Environment: This project will be conducted in the laboratory of Prof. Heinrich Kovar at the St. Anna Childrenâs Cancer Research Institute (CCRI) in Vienna. The CCRI is Austriaâs leading center for research on pediatric cancers and affiliated with the Medical University of Vienna. I will also collaborate with leading scientists in France (Olivier Delattre, Curie Institute), Austria (Christoph Bock & Keiryn Bennett, CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine) and the UK (Stephan Beck, University College London). Alignment with Funding Strategy: The proposed project addresses all goals of the Elise Richter Program: (i) it fosters career development of a qualified female scientist in Austria; (ii) the research program will establish the candidateâs scientific independence; (iii) the candidate provides a concrete career plan for becoming a principal investigator; (iv) the candidate pursues habilitation as the formal qualification for assistant professors in Austria.

Kinases are a group of enzymes that play a pivotal role in orchestrating the DNA-damage response, yet taken as a whole, the kinase family is largely understudied. To better understand the role of the human kinome in response to DNA damage we targeted the non-essential kinome (some 350 kinases in total) using CRISPR-Cas9 and subsequently screened these deficient cells against a panel of DNA damaging agents (16 in total), many of which are commonly used chemotherapeutics. This approach led to the identification of four novel interactions between kinases, frequently misregulated in cancer, (EPHB6, GSK3B, STYK16 and STYK1) and DNA damaging agents, used as chemotherapeutics. Now we aim to further investigate these novel interactions in a panel of cell lines, including patient-derived cell lines. Next we shall elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which loss of these kinases renders cells sensitive to DNA damaging inducing chemotherapeutics. Finally, we propose to prioritise and confirm our findings in a murine xenograft model for one of the identified interactions. Work resulting from this proposal may lead to the better treatment of patients with cancer due to mutations in the kinases EPHB6, GSK3B, STYK16 and STYK1.

The equipment must be housed in a facility with electricity and freezers for storage of temperature sensitive materials and equipment operation. Lateral flow based assays are an alternative diagnostic tool that is inexpensive, temperature stable, user-friendly and has a faster turn-around-time (TAT). However, this platform takes longer to develop, with reduced specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy compared to molecular-based assays. An ideal diagnostic tool combines the adaptability and reliability of molecular assays with the TAT, cost-effectiveness, and stability of lateral flow. Clustered Regularly Interspersed Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) based diagnostics can provide these capabilities and revolutionize the field of point-of-need molecular-based diagnostics. Our goal is to develop CRISPR-based diagnostics to detect SARS-CoV-2 at the point-of-need, such as at the bedside, passenger screening, or returning travellers who may have been exposed. We recently demonstrated that CRISPR-based diagnostics is reliable, sensitive and can be used to detect Ebola virus and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and caused more than 69,000 infections and contributed to over 1600 deaths. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to quickly diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection to administer appropriate patient care and isolation. CRISPR-based diagnostics is a next-generation diagnostic tool that can provide results in a timely manner and fill this gap. Implementation of CRISPR-based diagnostics will complement our armamentarium against high-consequence pathogens and will address the need for faster, cheaper, and more robust diagnostics for emerging infectious diseases of public health concern.

263	Prof. MERKLER Doron	UNIVERSITE DE GENEVE	2020-05-01	2025-04-30	Molecular pathology of anti-viral T cell responses in the central nervous system	Immune responses against viruses in the central nervous system (CNS) can result in devastating outcomes. Even non-cytolytic CD8+ T cell interactions, which purge viruses from neurons without triggering cell death, can induce permanent damage. Yet, how this immune response irreversibly disrupts neuronal homeostasis remains unclear. Here, we will elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underlie non-cytolytic CD8+ T cell engagement with infected neurons and their consequences on neuron function in vivo. We hypothesize that inflammatory signalling in neurons, induced by non-cytolytic CD8+ T cell interactions, triggers metabolic and epigenetic changes that underpin permanent neuronal dysfunction. "PATHOCODE" will test this hypothesis by harnessing a unique animal model of T cell-driven virus encephalitis in the following objectives: 1. Discern neuronal subset-specific vulnerabilities and antigen-dependent versus bystander effects in the inflamed CNS. We will perform single nucleus RNA sequencing to examine whether T cell engagement (a) differentially affects molecularly distinct neurons, and (b) affects non-targeted, uninfected neurons. 2. Uncover the consequences of non-cytolytic T cell engagement on neuronal metabolism. We will use cell-specific mitochondrial reporter mice to investigate immune-driven metabolic adaptation of neurons in vivo. 3. Determine how non-cytolytic T cell engagement affects the neuronal epigenome. We will employ cell-specific nucleus/ribosome reporter mice to elucidate how T cell engagement affects the translatome and epigenome of infected cells. 4. Rescue T cell-mediated neuronal dysfunction by restoring metabolic pathways. We will exploit recent CRISPR/Cas9 technological advances to restore neuronal gene expression and uncover the relevance of immune-driven metabolic and epigenomic changes to disease. Our study will thus provide novel molecular concepts about immune-driven neuronal alterations in CNS inflammatory diseases.	European Research Council	Consolidator Grant	1999954.0EUR

Lateral meristems, which provide thickness to tree stems and other plant organs, include vascular cambium (produces xylem [wood] and phloem); and cork cambium (forms cork, a tough protective layer). We recently identified the molecular mechanism that specifies stem cells of vascular cambium. Unexpectedly, this same set of experiments revealed also novel aspects of the regulation of cork cambium, a meristem whose development has remained unknown. CORKtheCAMBIA aims to identify the stem cells of cork cambium and reveal how they mechanistically regulate plant organ thickening. Thus, stemming from these novel unpublished findings and my matching expertise on plant stem cells and lateral growth, the timing is perfect to discover the molecular mechanism underlying specification of stem cells of cork cambium. To identify the origin of stem cells of cork cambium, 1st-we will combine lineage tracing with a detailed molecular marker analysis. To deduce the cell dynamics of cork cambium, 2nd-we will follow regeneration of the stem cells after ablation of this meristem. To discover the molecular factors regulating the stem cell specification of cork cambium, 3rd-we will utilize molecular genetics and a novel method (inducible CRISPR/Cas9 mutant targeting) being developed in my lab. Since the lateral growth is orchestrated by two adjacent, nested meristems, cork and vascular cambia, the growth process must be tightly co-regulated. Thus, 4th-an in silico model of the intertwined growth process will be generated. By combining modelling with experimentation, we will uncover mechanistically how cork and vascular cambium coordinate lateral growth. CORKtheCAMBIA will thus provide long-awaited insight into the regulatory mechanisms specifying the stem cells of lateral meristem as whole, lay the foundation for studies on radial thickening and facilitate rational manipulation of lateral meristems of crop plants and trees.

Host immune responses can play either protective or a pathologic role during infection.Therefore, understanding of the regulatory networks and signaling pathways that determine the magnitude andquality of an individual's antiviral immune response has important implications for human health, since thesegenes/pathways could be therapeutically targeted to control viral replication, to treat aberrant immuneresponses, or they may represent targets for enhancing the safety and efficacy of vaccines against a widerange of viral pathogens.Polymorphic host genes and regulatory networks have a major impact on immune response variation in humanpopulations. However, confounding environmental factors and/or ethical concerns limit the types of studiesthat can be conducted in humans. Therefore, genetically tractable model systems that capture the range ofgenetic and phenotypic diversity seen in humans are needed to mechanistically dissect the genetics of immunevariation. To address this need, we have used the Collaborative Cross (CC), a highly diverse mouse geneticreference population, to identify and characterize polymorphic host genes that regulate baseline and IAV-induced innate and adaptive immunity. As part of this effort, we have quantified variation in virus-inducedinnate and adaptive immune responses and disease over a 45 day time-course (Days 2, 4, 7, 10, 15, 28, and45 post infection) in a panel of 110 CC RIX lines (reproducible F1 crosses between CC recombinant inbred(RI) lines that model heterozygous Human populations). This resource, when combined with othercomplementary Systems Genetics tools, such as the Diversity Outbred (DO) population and CRISPR-mediatedgenome editing, data sets comparing the host response to other pathogens that are being studied in thecontext of this U19, and the analysis of gene expression changes and genetic variations in IAV infected humanpatients, gives us the opportunity to: 1) identify polymorphic genes associated with IAV immune responsevariation, and test their impact on other aspects of the antiviral response or virus-induced disease process, 2)test how these genes impact responses to other viral pathogens, or function during allergy/auto-immunity, and3) test the impact of these genes in the context of human infections to identify targets for diagnosis, preventionand therapeutic interventions in humans.

266	Dr Ismail Heba	University of Sheffield	2018-11-01	2023-10-31	Identifying a new treatment paradigm for osteoarthritis: targeting the ubiquitination machinery regulating inflammatory responses to injury	Osteoarthritis is a disease where joint destruction arises from maladaptive responses to repetitive tissue injury. Mechanical injury to articular cartilage results in chronic inflammation, pain and predisposes to tissue damage and loss of function. There is a pressing need for disease-modifying therapies for osteoarthritis. Identifying the cellular mechanisms regulating cellular responses to injury is crucial for understanding osteoarthritis and for designing specifically-tailored therapeutic regimens. Recently, I have discovered that injury to connective tissues including articular cartilage rapidly activates the formation of Lysine 63-polyubiquitin chains that induce downstream inflammatory cascades, highlighting the critical role of ubiquitination in regulating this mechanism. Ubiquitination is a multistep reaction to add ubiquitin linkages to a protein substrate. Eukaryotic cells contain a large number of ubiquitin enzymes and the key regulators driving injury responses are currently unknown. In this fellowship, my overarching aim is to identify a new way to treat osteoarthritis by targeting the injury-induced ubiquitination machinery. My objectives are therefore: 1) to define the injury ubiquitome, 2) to identify the key ubiquitin E3 ligases driving this mechanism and 3) to investigate whether targeting the injury-induced E3 ligases in vivo can protect against development/progression of osteoarthritis. Since a large number of enzymes are involved in regulating ubiquitination, it is necessary to use a model system in which high-throughput screening is possible using readily available molecular tools. Transparent transgenic zebrafish are well suited for such studies. Using cutting edge technologies including advanced transgenesis, advanced live imaging techniques and in vivo loss-of-function screens using CRISPR/Cas9 methodologies, I will identify the key pathway regulating the injury-induced cellular responses and will determine the major E3 ligase involved as a promising therapeutic target in osteoarthritis.

Genetic association studies have revealed 113 loci affecting the risk of developing AS, most of which lack functional explanations hindering their translation to patient benefits. More than half of the genes affecting the risk of developing AS are involved in T cells functions, suggesting the important role of T cells in the pathogenesis of AS. Through integration of GWAS, eQTL and transcriptome data, combined with functional validation of gene candidates regulating T cells in AS, this proposal focuses on identification of novel T cell therapeutic targets in AS. Methods: Gene candidates regulating T cell functions in AS will be identified through the integrated analysis of AS-associated genetic variations, CD4/CD8 eQTL, transcriptome of known AS-associated T cell subsets, transcriptome of CD4/CD8 from AS patients and healthy controls and single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) of T cells from blood, joint synovial fluid/tissue from AS patients. Prioritized gene candidates will be firstly validated by gene knockdown in primary T cells from AS patients and healthy controls. The validated genes will then undergo second validation through CRISPR-knockout or gene overexpression. For 1-2 validated genes, in-depth mechanistic studies in relevant T cell subtypes will be performed. Key pathways related to validated genes will be identified through RNA-seq experiments of gene-silenced or knockout primary cells and scRNA-seq data mentioned above. Key proteins in the pathways will then be determined and validated through gene knockdown or knockout and relevant cellular assays. Potential applications: Proposed study will be the first to systematically investigate disease-associated genetic variants for the genes regulating T cell functions in AS.

270	Dr Scott William	MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences	2018-03-01	2021-03-31	Clinical Lecturer in Endocrinology	Background: Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) is a common form of inflammatory arthritis without a cure. Genetic association studies have revealed 113 loci affecting the risk of developing AS, most of which lack functional explanations hindering their translation to patient benefits. More than half of the genes affecting the risk of developing AS are involved in T cells functions, suggesting the important role of T cells in the pathogenesis of AS. Through integration of GWAS, eQTL and transcriptome data, combined with functional validation of gene candidates regulating T cells in AS, this proposal focuses on identification of novel T cell therapeutic targets in AS. Methods: Gene candidates regulating T cell functions in AS will be identified through the integrated analysis of AS-associated genetic variations, CD4/CD8 eQTL, transcriptome of known AS-associated T cell subsets, transcriptome of CD4/CD8 from AS patients and healthy controls and single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) of T cells from blood, joint synovial fluid/tissue from AS patients. Prioritized gene candidates will be firstly validated by gene knockdown in primary T cells from AS patients and healthy controls. The validated genes will then undergo second validation through CRISPR-knockout or gene overexpression. For 1-2 validated genes, in-depth mechanistic studies in relevant T cell subtypes will be performed. Key pathways related to validated genes will be identified through RNA-seq experiments of gene-silenced or knockout primary cells and scRNA-seq data mentioned above. Key proteins in the pathways will then be determined and validated through gene knockdown or knockout and relevant cellular assays. Potential applications: Proposed study will be the first to systematically investigate disease-associated genetic variants for the genes regulating T cell functions in AS. Data generated will provide functional explanations for AS-associated genetic loci, promote the understanding the AS pathogenesis, and potentially identify novel therapeutic targets for treatment of AS and other related arthritis.

In particular CRISPR/Cas9 provides a tool-set thousands of researchers worldwide now utilize with unprecedented ease to edit genes, catalysing a broad range of biomedical and industrial applications. Gene synthesis technologies producing thousands of base pairs of synthetic DNA have become affordable. Current gene editing technology is highly effective for local, small genomic DNA edits and insertions. To unlock the full potential of this revolution, however, our capacities to disrupt or rewrite small local elements of code must be complemented by equal capacities to efficiently insert very large synthetic DNA cargos with a wide range of functions into genomic sites. Large designer cargos would carry multicomponent DNA circuitry including programmable and fine-tuneable functionalities, representing the vital interface between gene editing which is the state-of-the-art at present, and genome engineering, which is the future. This challenge remained largely unaddressed to date. We aspire to resolve this bottleneck by creating ground-breaking, generally applicable, easy-to-use technology to enable docking of large DNA cargos with base pair precision and unparalleled efficiency into mammalian genomes. To achieve our ambitious goals, we will apply a whole array of sophisticated tools. We will unlock a small non-human virus to rational design, creating safe, flexible and easy-to-produce, large capacity DNA delivery nanodevices with unmatched transduction capability. We will exploit a range of techniques including Darwinian in vitro selection/evolution to accomplish unprecedented precision DNA integration efficiency into genomic sites. We will use parallelized DNA assembly methods to generate multifunctional circuits, to accelerate T cell engineering, resolving unmet needs. Once we accomplish our tasks, our technology has the potential to be exceptionally rewarding to the scientific, industrial and medical communities.

Recent evidence shows that resident macrophages can originate from embryonic progenitors and be maintained in tissues long term by local proliferation independently of monocytes. This self-renewal ability, however, appears to decline with age, with potentially major consequences for the response to infection, the resolution of inflammation and the ability for tissue regeneration. Understanding the decline of self-renewal in the aging macrophage may thus hold key elements for maintaining healthy tissue integrity. Drawing from analogies to stem cell self-renewal we want to decipher the molecular and cellular parameters of macrophage self-renewal and its decline with age. We want to understand the age-associated changes in gene expression and epigenetic identity of tissue macrophage populations with the ultimate goal to reverse age dependent decline in self-renewal and function. Results from my laboratory have identified transcription factors that control the access to a network of self-renewal genes that are also used in stem cells. Using several complementary genetic mouse models tapping into this network we want to investigate whether its activation in resident macrophage population in vivo can rejuvenate their self-renewal capacity and revert aging related changes. These approaches will be complemented by unbiased genome wide screens in vivo using latest generation CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology to identify new signaling pathways guiding macrophage self-renewal and aging. Using innovate combinations of genetics and adoptive transfer protocols we will test whether this knowledge can be employed to reverse macrophage dependent loss of immune competence and failed tissue regeneration with age. Our results will lead to new general insight and potential novel cellular therapies for degenerative diseases.	European Research Council	Advanced Grant	2499994.0EUR

275	Hehl Adrian B.	University of Zurich	2015-10-01	2018-09-30	Cyst wall formation: a persistent challenge in Toxoplasmosis	The acute phase of Toxoplasma gondii infection initiates with the rapid proliferation and dissemination of the fast-replicating form of the parasite (tachyzoite) throughout the vertebrate host. At the onset of the immune response, the tachyzoites are efficiently neutralized and the infection enters in a chronic phase with conversion to a slow-replicating developmental stage (bradyzoite) that forms tissue cysts predominantly in the central nervous system and in striated and heart muscle. This process of encystation is vital to the parasiteâs life cycle because i) it ensures survival and life-long persistence in intermediate hosts, and ii) it allows peroral transmission to the feline definitive host, initiating the sexual cycle. Tissue cysts not only prevent eradication of the parasite, but also pose a significant threat of reactivation in the context of host immunosuppression and can lead to encephalitis and other severe clinical manifestations.Despite the central importance of cyst formation for pathogenesis and transmission, our insight into how T. gondii defies the innate and adaptive immune responses to take up permanent residence in the immunocompetent hosts is rudimentary. Very little is known about the cyst wall composition and the molecular processes governing its formation. We have a very fragmented view of the temporal and spatial dissemination of cysts in the host and especially in the brain. Progress in biology is driven both by medical necessity and scientific curiosity and this project, which proposes to investigate the process of encystation, lies at the intersection of these two forces. It is the most propitious time to address the challenging question of cyst wall formation in light of the most recent breakthroughs in the sensitivity of -omics approaches, the power of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in genome editing, the revolution in high-throughput microscopy, and ex-vivo tissue examination at the highest level of resolution.This ambitious and highly synergistic project tackles key biological questions on tissue cyst formation and capitalizes heavily on cutting-edge technologies to address three specific objectives:1. A comprehensive definition of the cyst wall composition. We will generate an unprecedentedly accurate transcriptome of the bradyzoite stage and a differential proteome of bradyzoites and the surrounding cyst wall. The data will be curated via a powerful comparative genomics approach spanning cyst-forming and cyst-lacking Apicomplexa species. A complementary mutagenesis and selection strategy is designed to identify specific defects in cyst formation or maturation by large-scale genetic screens using quantitative high-throughput microscopy.2. An uncovering of molecular mechanisms governing the cyst wall formation. This aim will be accomplished by taking a targeted as well as a global functional approach. Starting from recent findings on parasitophorous vacuole formation of tachyzoites we will implement a semi-targeted gene knockout- or conditional knockout approach. Moreover, the creation of a comprehensive gene disruption collection in subproject 1 will allow identification of all non-essential tachyzoites genes that display trafficking defects during cyst formation. Key mutants will be mechanistically dissected in vitro with a subset to be investigated further in vivo. 3. A spatiotemporal cartography of cyst formation in the brain. We will harness cutting-edge imaging methods to investigate the in vivo dynamics of dissemination and cyst formation in the whole body and foremost in the brain of a mouse infection model. These findings will inform development of spatiotemporal models describing parasite dissemination and differentiation, to be correlated with data from post-mortem biopsies. By combining unbiased and targeted experimental approaches, we are poised to achieve major conceptual advances in deciphering the molecular events leading to cyst wall formation. In the long term, the data and technology created in this project will lay the foundation to decoding the molecular information exchange between host and pathogen during establishment of life-long latent infections. These studies fill a significant knowledge gap and will provide i) highly valuable web-accessible integrated gene expression data, ii) fundamental discoveries about the regulatory and trafficking circuits that govern formation of the cyst wall as a biological barrier during encystation iii) invaluable paradigms of how the parasite initiates and sustains molecular programs required for disease progression and persistence.

Over the course of evolution, eukaryotes have acquired mitochondria to perform efficient energy conversion from food and oxygen into ATP, a process called oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Mitochondrial OXPHOS and cytosolic glycolysis are the two major pathways for generating cellular ATP and cells are exquisitely tuned to dynamically match nutrient fuel sources and energy demands. Much of our understanding of mitochondrial and metabolic rewiring in response to fuel sources has been elucidated using yeast as a model system. However we currently lack a systems biology view of this process in humans. Elucidating these fundamental cellular pathways is crucial for understanding and treating mitochondrial dysfunction, which underlies human diseases ranging from neonatal lethality to type II diabetes, cancer and neurodegeneration.In exciting preliminary studies, I have harnessed the ability of human K562 cells to quickly rewire metabolism from glycolysis to mitochondrial OXPHOS when glucose is replaced by galactose in the media. Here, I propose to leverage our labâs deep expertise in genomics and systems biology to decipher mechanisms underlying the mitochondrial âactivationâ and âdeactivationâ in response to changes in sugar availability. Specifically, I will (1) identify the markers of mitochondrial activation by systematic RNA, protein and metabolite profiling during nutrient shifting, (2) identify genetic drivers of mitochondrial activation using genome-wide CRISPR and ORF screening and (3) integrate these results to decipher molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial activation. These findings are likely to help our understanding of cellular metabolism as well as mitochondrial function and pathologies.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Advanced Postdoc.Mobility	1487850.0CHF
277	Seeber Andrew	University of Basel	2017-08-01	2018-07-31	Improving CRISPR-Cas9 efficiency using small molecules to modulate chromatin structure	Gene therapy holds the possibility to revolutionize the way otherwise incurable genetic diseases are treated. In principle, it allows for the DNA within a cell to be changed. With the dawn of new gene editing technologies such as CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 9), repairing mutations within human cells has become reality. Our ability to program this bacterial defense mechanism with human target sequences has unlocked unprecedented possibilities for gene therapy and personalized medicine.While deleting a gene to impair its function within a cell is presently fairly easy, the reversion of a detrimental mutation back to its non-disease state is much more difficult. This requires exchange of one sequence by another, which is only entirely precise when mediated by a process called homologous recombination or homology directed repair (HDR). While CRISPR-Cas9 has made gene editing by homologous recombination easier, its efficiency remains poor. This is a major limitation that must be overcome if genome editing technologies are to be used in medical treatments or commercial applications in biotechnology. The majority of research that focuses on improving CRISPR-Cas9 has tried to modify the components of the bacterial Cas9 system. Our approach, however, addresses this problem from a completely different perspective. We have shown that one can greatly increase repair by homologous recombination by making the cellâs genome more accessible to the editing machinery. Simply put, reverting a mutation by gene editing is like trying to cut a metal wire with a pair of office scissors; this still works but is very inefficient. Instead, our method changes the metal wire into a piece of string, allowing the scissors to cut easily. The underlying evidence for this project stems from our research in budding yeast, where we showed that making DNA more accessible enhances the rate of genome integrations 4-fold. If true in mammalian cells, this research could become a fundamental aspect of genome editing, applicable not only to CRISPR-Cas9 but also to any gene editing technologies yet to come.With the support of the Bridge funding for a Proof of Concept, I will expand our previous work from yeast to human cells. I plan to develop compounds that can be used to transiently lower histone levels in human cell culture. My ultimate goal is to increase the accessibility of DNA in the context of gene editing to enhance CRISPR-Cas9 editing efficiencies in somatic cells. I aim to establish the data necessary to bridge from basic research to a tool that will enable the use of gene editing for biotech or medical applications.

In such cases, prognosis have not improved over the last dec-ades and outcome is still unacceptably low. Only a limited number of studies directly address this prob-lem, mainly because in vivo model systems to mimic recurrences and identify novel drug sensitivities are lacking. One additional problem specific to pediatric malignancies is the paucity of actionable mutations that can be identified both from diagnostic as well as relapse samples. Hence, existing recurrent genetic abnormalities such as translocation events gain additional weight and we can hypothesize that other mechanisms such as epigenetic transcriptional control might play a major role in disease development. To specifically address these topics, we suggest in this proposal to take advantage of our novel insights that have recently been obtained during the current funding period. We are also proud that we are now part of a very large European initiative which will allow us to substantially expand our collection of pa-tient-derived xenografts and which will be used in most of the proposed projects. To gain novel insights into development and treatment of recurrent disease, we will address the following specific aims: Aim 1: To establish a personalized drug screening platform and identify novel treatment vulnerabilities directly in patient derived primary cell cultures. We hypothesize that new sequencing efforts of recurrent samples have to be supplemented with functional drug screens to advance treatment of relapsed patients. In addition, our platform serves as discovery tool to identify novel mechanisms of drug resistances and novel biomarkers for patient selection.Aim 2: To further validate CHD4 as major drug target in pediatric malignancies and describe the epi-genetic landscape of fusion positive-RMS tumors in general. We hypothesize that CHD4, a newly iden-tified crucial co-factor of the RMS specific fusion protein PAX3-FOXO1, has a more widespread function as epigenetic reader than previously appreciated. In addition, we will use unbiased large scale screens to identify novel epigenetic vulnerabilities in RMS tumors.Aim 3: To identify novel (chemo)resistance mechanisms directly in patient derived tumor material and develop novel rational combinatorial treatment strategies. Using both unbiased in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 drop-out screens and a hypothesis driven approach investigating the contribution of hedgehog signaling, and by comparing diagnostic versus relapse samples from the same patients, we will identify resistance mechanisms that will guide combinatorial drug development, aiming at re-sensitizing tumors that are resistant to commonly applies chemotherapeutics. We expect that this follow-up proposal will provide relevant novel insights into RMS biology and pro-gression by working directly with patient material and will contribute novel pre-clinical information to guide development of targeted therapies into early phase I/II clinical protocols.

Researchers have used mice and rats to model kidney damage seen in human patients with diabetes, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, lupus and fibrosis injury. Although many useful gene and protein targets have emerged from these studies, rodent models are limited for a number of reasons. One is the ethical issues around the numbers of mice in particular that are needed to generate gene knockouts, particularly tissue-specific knockouts (usually in the 100s-1000s). A second limitation is the fact that mice and rat models do not faithfully recapitulate the disease phenotype seen in the human kidney. For example, the most commonly used genetic strain of mice, C57Bl/6, are resistant to diabetes-induced kidney damage. Many gene and proteins that have been identified in rodent models have failed to materialise as bona fide targets when tested in humans. These limitations have led to a growing frustration in academia and industry, and led to the drive to improve our models of CKD. We propose to establish a new model of kidney injury based on 3D organoids derived from human iPS cells. Our protocol of differentiation triggers the formation of both glomerular and tubular epithelial cells that form themselves into glomerular-like and tubule-like structures (Fig. 2). These organoids will form the basis of the three interrelated project aims, which will use cell biology, microscopy and single cell sequencing to interrogate the genetic profile of the kidney organoid cells (Aim 1). We will then establish a range of new models of CKD exposing organoids to high glucose and other important drivers of kidney disease to induce damage. Cutting-edge single cell sequencing using the 10 x Genomics platform (https://www.10xgenomics.com) will be applied in-house to interrogate the genetic profiles of each of the different kidney-like cells in 3D organoids in normal versus disease conditions. The sequencing data obtained from the various organoid damage models will then be compared to existing datasets from previously used rodent models of disease available on the GEO bioinformatics platform (e.g. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/GDSbrowser?acc=GDS3990). The critical role of Gremlin1 in organoid formation and response to fibrotic insult will be tested using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Successful completion of this project will achieve a number of scientific objectives. The first is the development of a next generation cell culture organoid model of kidney injury and CKD. The development of 3D organoid models is a common direction of travel in many fields, as the limitations of studying individual cells in isolation are becoming increasingly evident. A major outcome from this proposal will be reduction potential under the NC3Rs framework. Given the numbers of mice used for CKD experiments each year (estimated at approximately 68,000 in 2016, Fig. 1), and the moderate/severe grading of many of these experiments, we believe there is exciting potential to reduce these numbers in the future. Another significant deliverable will be the use of human iPS cells to generate the kidney organoids, which will represent a translationally relevant model of human kidney disease. The potential to modify the ES cells at the gene level using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing will allow researchers to interrogate the role of their gene of interest not only in kidney development, but also in kidney cell responses to disease insults in a 3D organoid. We will use our networks such as the European Renal Cell Study Group (ERSCG) in the UK, Europe and the US to promote the potential of the organoid model as an alternative to rodent models of CKD. Dissemination of our results at national meetings such as the UK Kidney Week and the American Society of Nephrology will maximise the potential of widespread uptake and create exciting added value for the project.

283	Dr. REICHMANN Florian	Medical University of Graz	2017-09-01	2020-08-31	Genetic and environmental basis of aggression in zebrafish	Aggression is characterized by the intention to harm others for offensive or defensive purposes. The aetiology of aggression is multifactorial involving both genetic and environmental factors. Several genes have been associated with human aggression, but their specific contribution to this behaviour needs further investigation. The zebrafish has emerged as an important model for aggression research because of its short generation time, ease of maintenance in the laboratory, genetic manipulability and the availability of robust behavioural tests. In the current project called: âAnalysis of the genetic and environmental basis of aggression using zebrafishâ, I plan to study the effect of deletion of genes associated with human aggression (Monoamine oxidase A and Latrophilin 3) and of selective breeding for aggression on zebrafish behaviour and neurobiology. CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing will be used to create a novel zebrafish mutant line for monoamine oxidase, the zebrafish orthologue of Monoamine oxidase A, while a latrophilin 3.1 mutant line, the zebrafish orthologue of Latrophilin 3, is already available in the proposed host lab. To assess the functional consequences of gene knockout and of selective breeding, I will investigate the aggression levels of zebrafish using mirror-induced stimulation, live-conspecific induced stimulation and video-induced stimulation. I will also quantify neurotransmitter release, neurotransmitter levels and neurotransmitter receptor expression by fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, high-performance liquid chromatography, qPCR, in situ hybridization, Western Blot and immunohistochemistry. Finally, to assess the influence of the environment upon aggression levels, mutant zebrafish, selectively-bred and wildtype zebrafish will be kept in standard, enriched or impoverished environment followed by behavioural and molecular analysis. I hypothesize that candidate gene knockout and selective breeding will both increase the aggression levels of zebrafish and induce specific neurobiological changes in the brain depending on their living environment. The project shall be performed in the lab of Dr William Norton at the University of Leicester. Dr Norton is a leading expert in genetic and behavioural analyses of zebrafish with a focus on aggression, hyperactivity and impulsivity, the core topic of this proposal. His lab and research group will provide the ideal surroundings to complete this project, because he has established a unique setup to automatically detect zebrafish aggression as well as techniques to investigate brain function including fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. This project will yield novel animal models for aggression and advance our current knowledge of aggression genetics, with the potential to help develop novel treatments for this behaviour.

The aetiology of aggression is multifactorial involving both genetic and environmental factors. Several genes have been associated with human aggression, but their specific contribution to this behaviour needs further investigation. The zebrafish has emerged as an important model for aggression research because of its short generation time, ease of maintenance in the laboratory, genetic manipulability and the availability of robust behavioural tests. In the current project called: âAnalysis of the genetic and environmental basis of aggression using zebrafishâ, I plan to study the effect of deletion of genes associated with human aggression (Monoamine oxidase A and Latrophilin 3) and of selective breeding for aggression on zebrafish behaviour and neurobiology. CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing will be used to create a novel zebrafish mutant line for monoamine oxidase, the zebrafish orthologue of Monoamine oxidase A, while a latrophilin 3.1 mutant line, the zebrafish orthologue of Latrophilin 3, is already available in the proposed host lab.

We are interested in spacer acquisition in the CRISPR-Cas system and have shown how Cas1-Cas2 captures foreign DNA. We plan to solve the structure of the complete integrase complex to understand how it binds target DNA and inserts protospacers into the CRISPR locus. Cas4 is also involved in spacer acquisition in some CRISPR types. We will identify the structural basis of acquisition in Cas4-containing systems and elucidate the roles of Cas4. In addition, we plan to identify the unknown RNase that trims crRNA from its 3â-end, and address the molecular mechanism of RNA-induced silencing in type III systems. Our previous study suggested that bacteria have a DNA interference system. We demonstrated the molecular mechanism of DNA-guided DNA interference using structural and functional studies. We will now focus on the guide DNA biogenesis pathway. Ago also has potential to be a genome editing tool due to its sequence-specific DNA cleavage activity. We will optimize the TtAgo sequence to screen for mutants which have high cleavage activity at 37Â°C.	Wellcome Trust	International Research Scholar Award	500404.17USD

Understanding the genetics of cholangiocarcinoma has been hampered by relatively small sample sizes, where whole exome sequencing (WES) has yielded a broad mutational profile that does not provide a standout mutational signature that can be targeted therapeutically. In this study, we aim to use computational tools to conduct a combined analysis of 413 cholangiocarcinoma WES datasets. We will then define driver mutations from this dataset using algorithms that predict the likelihood of a mutation being oncogenic. These computationally derived mutations will be used to conduct a forward genetic screen in bile duct organoids using Cas9/CRISPR, the expectation is that neutral mutations will be filtered out and we will to derive a list of impacting, functional oncogenic mutations. This combination of in silico and in vitro methodology will determine bona fide oncogenes from a highly-triaged list of candidate mutations. Whilst we are focused on cholangiocarcinoma, this methodology will be important in identifying oncogenes in other rare cancers or cancers which have diverse mutational spectra.

Platelets, through the interaction with lymphatic endothelial cells, lead to the separation of the blood and lymphatic vasculatures throughout embryonic development and into adulthood. However it is not understood how this interaction maintains the separation of the two vasculatures and how platelets guide lymphatic endothelial cell behaviour. Previous research has focused on the generation of mouse models which lack the versatility available from other model organisms such as Zebrafish. We have identified Zebrafish orthologues of the key molecules involved in the separation of the lymphatic and blood vasculatures and have demonstrated that they form complexes with other membrane associated proteins.We will develop a Zebrafish model to determine the mechanistic basis underlying the separation of the blood and lymphatic vasculatures. We hypothesize that membrane complexes regulate the cellular behaviour of lymphatic endothelial cells. Complex members will be identified using biological mass spectrometry and their spatial distribution quantified using two-colour dSTORM super resolution microscopy. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology will introduce gene disruptions and mutations into the Zebrafish genome allowing the mechanistic basis underlying the separation of the blood and lymphatic vasculatures in vivo to be determined.This proposal will lead to mechanistic insight underlying the separation of the lymphatic and blood vasculatures by platelets and will develop a model with the translational potential to assess the impact of therapeutic compounds on the separation of these two vasculatures in vivo.

We contribute to a new strategy by genetically modifying insect vectors, sandflies (Lutzomyia longipalpis) and triatomine bugs (Rhodnius prolixus), leading eventually to transgenic insects resistant to disease agents. We will use two different transgenic approaches, piggyBac and CRISPR-Cas9. PiggyBac is a method for semi random insertion of exogenous DNA into the genome. CRISPR-Cas9 is a new and highly targeted method to manipulate genes in a manner not previously possible. â¢ Microinjection of insect embryos with piggyBac plasmids to obtain insects expressing fluorescent markers for subsequent CRISPR-Cas9 knockout experiments facilitating easy monitoring of outcomes. â¢ Knockout of fluorescent markers (above), using CRISPR-Cas9 constructs, demonstrating that system components are functional and that we can precisely target genes of interest. â¢ Knockout of endogenous genes by CRISPR-Cas 9 that are non-essential or important in sustaining infection in insect vectors. â¢ Insertion and expression of exogenous DNA (fluoresence markers) using CRISPR-Cas9 harnessing homology directed repair facilitating inheritance to offspring at levels above mendelian inheritance (gene drive).

Established very early in human development, body weight regulation is brain-governed by the hypothalamus. Consequently, genetic variants acting by disrupting hypothalamic function lead to severe obesity. However, the manner in which these variants contribute to obesity via exerting neurodevelopmental and molecular changes has been difficult to study since human brain tissue is inaccessible. Historically, rodent models have extensively contributed to our understanding of energy homeostasis, but they carry inherent limitations due to inter-species differences in brain structure and physiology, as well as gene sequences. Therefore, development of human study systems for disease modelling is an important complementary approach to animal and patient studies aimed at investigating human obesity. We propose to use several novel methodologies: precise genome engineering with CRISPR/Cas9 in stem cells, 2D hypothalamic cultures, as well as 3D brain organoids, to: (1) generate physiologically relevant cellular and tissue models of human genetic obesity; (2) investigate neurodevelopmental aspects of the disease; (3) utilise the models to study molecular mechanisms leading to obesity.

Medical University of Vienna	2019-05-01	2022-04-30	Role of ARID1A in endometrial cancer organoid model	Endometrial cancer is the most prevalent gynaecological malignancy in developed countries and the incidence rates are steadily increasing. Endometrial cancer is associated with a number of mutations including those in components of the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway, in KRAS and in ARID1A. ARID1A is a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex and although ARID1A is the most frequent target of mutations in endometrial tumours, the mechanism by which its inactivation promotes tumorigenesis is unclear, not least due to the lack of a suitable experimental model. Recently, we and others have established 3D endometrial organoid cultures that faithfully recapitulate the architecture, expression patterns, hormonal responsiveness and secretory abilities of the in vivo endometrial epithelium. We propose to employ this system to elucidate the function of ARID1A in human endometrium and its role in initiation and progression of endometrial cancer. Using loss of function experiments, expression analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we aim to identify the set of genes directly regulated by ARID1A in human endometrial epithelium. To gain novel insights into the ARID1A mode of action we seek to determine ARID1A protein interactors using immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. We expect to identify transcription factors that recruit ARID1A (as part of the SWI/SNF complex) to specific genomic loci as well as endometrium-specific subunits of the SWI/SNF complex. In addition, we will test the hypothesis that oestrogen signalling contributes to progression of the ARID1A-deficient endometrial tumours. Moreover, we aim to generate an organoid model of endometrial cancer by introduction of mutation in ARID1A, KRAS and/or PIKCA3 genes using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. We will follow effects of these mutations on niche factor dependency, organoid growth and tumorigenicity upon transplantation into mice and in the context of high estrogen signalling. Overall, here we propose to use a unique, comprehensive approach by combing mechanistic advances with functional assays in a novel cancer model system to understand the role of ARID1A in endometrial biology and malignancy.

PD pathogenesis is driven, at least in part, by defects in proteostasis and mitochondrial function, leading to degeneration of dopaminergic axons and neuronal death. Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) such as GDNF can protect and restore dopaminergic axons. However, attempts to deploy NTFs ectopically in therapy models, or to increase proteostasis and mitochondrial function, have met with only limited success. I hypothesize that instead of ectopic application, over-expression of relevant pathways restricted to physiologically appropriate cells provides a potent therapeutic approach to treat PD. I have made significant progress toward this goal by targeting the 3âUTR in the mouse Gdnf gene, thereby increasing expression levels without affecting the geneâs spatiotemporal expression pattern. Using this approach I have shown that elevation of endogenous GDNF levels protects mice from experimentally induced PD. Unlike ectopic GDNF application, it causes no side effects. Importantly, I have established that GDNF levels can be elevated by 3âUTR targeting in adulthood, suggesting that this strategy could be applied in humans late in life. I will use 3âUTR targeting to study the therapeutic potential of overexpressing endogenous genes, using transgenics and CRISPR-Cas9âmediated 3âUTR editing in adult mice. First, I will increase the expression of NTFs in adult mice with experimentally induced PD. Next, I will upregulate genes important in mitochondrial function and proteostasis and test whether concurrently upregulating endogenous NTFs is a viable approach for treating PD. Third, I will use 3âUTR targeting to create a mouse model of PD in which alpha-synuclein is overexpressed, for better validation of my therapeutic strategy. Collectively, these experiments should establish proof of concept for a revolutionary, safe and effective treatment for PD.	European Research Council	Consolidator Grant	1999987.0EUR

Before implantation, the hatched ungulate blastocyst must undergo dramatic morphological changes characterized by cell differentiation, proliferation and migration processes leading to the development of extra-embryonic membranes, the appearance of a flat embryonic disc and gastrulation. This prolonged preimplantation development is termed conceptus elongation and deficiencies on this process constitute the most frequent cause of reproductive failures in ungulates, including the 4 most relevant mammalian livestock species in Europe. The purpose of this project is to elucidate the factors involved in conceptus elongation by gene editing and in vitro culture approaches. A first objective will be to identify key genes involved in differentiation processes by RNA-seq analysis of different embryo derivatives from bovine conceptuses at different developmental stages. Subsequently, the function of some of the genes identified as well as others known to play a crucial role in mouse development or putatively involved in embryo-maternal interactions will be assessed. For this aim, bovine embryos in which a candidate gene has been ablated (KO) will be generated by CRISPR and transferred to recipient females to assess in vivo the function of such particular gene on conceptus development. A second set of experiments pursue the development of an in vitro system for conceptus elongation that would bypass the requirement for in vivo experiments. For this aim we will perform metabolomics and proteomics analyses of bovine uterine fluid at different stages and will use these data to rationally develop a culture system able to sustain conceptus development. The knowledge generated by this project will serve to develop strategies to enhance farming profitability by reducing embryonic loss and to understand Developmental Biology questions unanswered by the mouse model.

A plethora of functions have been attributed to these proteases such as killing pathogens, inactivating toxins, inducing death of infected or cancer cells, modulating cytokine activity and remodeling extracellular matrix proteins. Much progress has been made in the last decade in understanding the functions of intracellular serpins which inhibit granule proteases of immune cells. Importantly, we have established that Serpinb1 is an essential survival factor of neutrophils (PMNs) through the inhibition of their own granule protease CatG. CatG triggers a form of programmed cell death that has features of apoptosis through activation of caspases and of regulated necrosis with rapid loss of plasma membrane integrity and release of inflammatory mediators. Although we have made significant advances, the exact molecular mechanisms leading to cell death and inflammation in the absence of intracellular serpins remain to be identified. In this project, we will use a combination of targeted (hypothesis-driven) and untargeted (degradomics and phenotype screening) methods to address the knowledge gaps in the mechanisms of CatG-mediated cell death and in the functions of Serpinb1, Serpinb6 and Serpinb9 in vivo. In particular, we have taken the high risk, high reward approach of mouse genetics and developed unique models to directly address these important questions. The proposed project will address the following two aims: Our first specific aim is to identify the mechanisms of cell death mediated by cathepsin G in myeloid cells. We will focus on the biology of myeloid cells and further explore specific cell death pathways associated with PMN and monocyte PCD in vitro. We will use a comparative proteomic approach to identify the CatG-specific degradome in PMNs associated with cell death. The identified targets will be validated by genetic targeting, including CRISPR and Cas9 designer nuclease technology. The second specific aim is to investigate the global and individual functions of the 14 functional serpins encoded in the expanded mouse SerpinB6-SerpinB9-SerpinB1 gene cluster on mouse chromosome 13, for which we generated a complete, yet viable knock-out. We will investigate specific defects of innate and adaptive immune cell development, homeostasis in steady state and inflammatory conditions. We will particularly investigate the cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous functions of invariant NKT cell subsets, which appear to be negatively regulated by SerpinB1 and, potentially, also by other intracellular serpins of this cluster. Finally, we will perform a standardized, comprehensive phenotypic screening of mice lacking all clade B serpin genes on mouse chromosome 13. This explorative analysis will be followed by a second stage testing where identified defects will be functionally investigated for individual serpin genes and their known target proteases. Overall, this multipronged project based on animal genetics will identify and functionally validate novel proteolytic targets associated with programmed cell death and will reveal important pathophysiological mechanisms mediated by granule proteases of immune cells and their inhibitors, which will likely have implications for developmental, inflammatory, infectious and proliferative diseases.

What molecular programs specify the LPM within the embryonic mesoderm and subsequently pattern it into the bilateral stripes that differentiate into its descendant cell fates remain unknown. The goals of my proposed projects is to chart previously elusive cell fates of the LPM and to uncover the molecular regulation of LPM formation using the zebrafish (Danio rerio) as principal model. Understanding LPM formation and patterning will provide a developmental framework of how key features of the vertebrate body plan evolved. Further, an improved mechanistic grasp of LPM formation will provide a concept to understand the genetic causes of congenital cardiovascular disorders.The zebrafish embryo provides a unique model to tackle LPM formation with its rapid development, optical translucency, and potent genetic toolbox. In our previous and ongoing work, we have uncovered several cis-regulatory elements that are specifically active in the emerging LPM in different vertebrate species. Our experiments allow us to track the forming LPM in unprecedented detail, have revealed an ancient, evolutionarily conserved program that drives LPM formation, and enabled us to add additional cell fates of LPM descent. We have further maximized mutagenesis with CRISPR-Cas9 to rapidly probe the developmental contribution of genes and cis-regulatory elements accompanied by state-of-the-art sequence analysis.Here, we will combine live lightsheet microscopy (SPIM) of unique LPM reporter strains, genetic lineage tracing, chromatin analysis, and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutagenesis to investigate the regulation of LPM emergence and cell migration. In Aim 1, we will address open questions concerning the LPMâs cell fate architecture. In Aim 1A, we will combine latest transgenic zebrafish techniques to investigate the controversial origins of individual endothelial lineages during body plan formation. In Aim 1B, we will pursue the identity of individual LPM stripes, which have received conflicting definitions in the past.For Aim 2, we will chart and functionally investigate the regulatory landscape of emerging LPM territory and will probe the regulation of its dynamic cell migration. In Aim 2A, we will chart the regulatory landscape of the emerging LPM with chromatin analysis and will establish the developmental contribution of individual cis-regulatory elements as basis for targeting putative enhancers in vivo using our new CRISPR-Cas9 tools. We will complement this approach in Aim 2B with somatic CRISPR-Cas9-based mutagenesis of migration- and adhesion-controlling candidate genes to elucidate how the spatio-temporal migration pattern in the LPM is coordinated. Altogether, our aims will elucidate fundamental open questions in vertebrate development, and will establish a new paradigm for discovering and functionally validating cis-regulatory elements and molecular regulators in vivo.

In eukaryotes, the cytosolic Hsp90 is essential, undoubtedly because of its central role in the proteostasis system. With the help of a large cohort of cofactors (co-chaperones), it associates with a substantial portion of all proteins, and constitutes a major hub of the proteome. Hsp90 clients include many regulatory and signaling proteins that depend on it to stabilize thermodynamically metastable states. The mitochondrial Hsp90 isoform Trap1, a simplified version of an Hsp90 machine, regulates cellular energy metabolism. Despite a recent explosion of the Hsp90/Trap1 literature, their in vivo functions in normal and cancer cells remain poorly understood. We propose to fill some of these knowledge gaps with a multi-pronged approach.Specific goals:â¢Genetic dissection of the Hsp90 machine in the mouse: Understand the global physiological and pathological functions of this molecular chaperone machine in a complex model organism. For the core components Hsp90 and Hsp90, and for the co-chaperones Aha1, Aha2, and Aarsd1, we will study the phenotypes of constitutive or conditional gene deletions at a global level and for selected tissues, and try to link phenotype with genotype mechanistically.â¢Functional interactions at the cellular level: Elucidate the essential functional interactions of this major molecular chaperone machine and proteome hub by genome-wide synthetic lethal and chemogenomic screens with mammalian cell lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. These screens for essential interacting genes will be done with cells lacking Hsp90, Hsp90, or the co-chaperone Stip1/Hop, or treated with an Hsp90 inhibitor or exposed to other proteostasis perturbations.â¢Hsp90 and cancer: Discover why cancer cells are more Hsp90-dependent and hypersensitive to Hsp90 inhibitors. A key tool for the analysis of the role of individual factors and pathways will be an isogenic pair of normal and Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells. â¢Synthetic chaperone: Strip Hsp90 down to the bare essentials by reconstructing it into a synthetic chaperone. Identify the absolutely essential core functions and the significance of Hsp90 heterodimers.â¢Live cell imaging of Hsp90 interactions: Develop luminescence resonance energy transfer with lanthanide ions as a powerful tool to do 'real-time in vivo biochemistry' of the Hsp90 machine.â¢Mitochondrial Hsp90 isoform Trap1: Understand how Trap1 regulates cellular energy metabolism and how this affects physiological cellular processes such as the regulation of cell size and cell migration, and, as a long-term goal, pathological events such as cancer and other diseases.

To carry out these supportive roles, glial cells must be properly positioned and shaped in the mature nervous system. The underlying developmental mechanisms are not well understood. Defects in glial cell morphology are associated with several neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. My preliminary results, using time-lapse confocal imaging in the embryonic zebrafish retina, show that glial cells dynamically interact with their neighbouring cellular environment during development. I will investigate how glial cells find their correct position and shape in the retina. I aim to characterise the specific glial-neuronal cell interactions and determine intrinsic molecular pathways regulating the distinct glial morphological responses. Combining confocal time-lapse imaging, cell specific transgenes and genetic ablation of specific neuron types I will investigate the nature and necessity of glial-neuronal interactions in real time in vivo. I will also use cell-labelling techniques to validate the glial specific expression of candidate genes identified in our previous transcriptomic dataset. The top three candidates will be selected for CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis. This work will provide insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating of glial patterning and morphogenesis, aimed at uncovering the molecular regulators of dynamic cellular interactions.

ALDH7A1 deficiency is a paradigm of how our limited understanding of underlying pathomechanisms leaves many patients with suboptimal clinical outcome. Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE) has been known since 1954 but only within the last decade its molecular background has been elucidated. The majority of PDE cases is caused by a block in lysine degradation due to ALDH7A1 deficiency with the accumulation of metabolic intermediates that inactivate the essential cofactor vitamin B6 (pyridoxine; pyridoxal 5â-phosphate (PLP)). It has become obvious, that irrespective of early treatment, about 75% of ALDH7A1 deficient patients suffer from intellectual disability (IQ < 70). This statistic suggests permanent neuronal damage is caused by the accumulation of metabolic intermediates associated with impaired activity of ALDH7A1. Interestingly no firm correlation has been found between genotype, accumulation of known metabolites and intellectual outcome. We hypothesize that the variation in cognitive outcome of ALDH7A1 deficiency could be caused by crucial pathomechanisms outside of the lysine catabolic pathway, which have not been identified to date.Here we propose the use of mass spectrometry-based metabolomics to investigate the comprehensive biochemical perturbations due to ALDH7A1 deficiency.Aim 1 Generation of in vitro models of ALDH7A1 deficiency enable the comparative metabolomics of ALDH7A1 deficiency under precisely controlled experimental conditions. We will develop tissue culture models in patient derived fibroblasts, in addition to using CRISPR/Cas genome editing to generate ALDH7A1 deficient astrocyte-neuronal co-cultures.Aim 2 High-resolution mass spectrometric metabolomic analysis of in vitro models and patient biofluids will be performed by a targeted metabolomic analysis of known pathways affected in ALDH7A1 deficiency; isotopic tracers in model systems will reveal the fate of essential metabolites e.g. PLP and its products. Untargeted metabolomic analysis will reveal hitherto unrecognized pathomechanisms that may be crucial to our understanding of the variability in outcome. Metabolic profiles from the in vitro models will be compared to those of biofluids in ALDH7A1 deficient patients with normal cognitive outcome versus those with cognitive deficits as well as healthy controls.A better understanding of all crucial pathomechanisms in ALDH7A1 deficiency has the potential to improve therapeutic options and ultimately improve the long-term outcome of affected children.

Animal models of familial ALS have demonstrated that intrinsic events within MNs are crucial for initiation of degeneration. From these models, we also know that the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) are primary affected before the onset of central MN loss. Thus it is likely that communication between muscle and MNs is altered with disease. Signals from MN to muscle (anterograde) and from muscle to MN (retrograde) are key regulators of development, maturation and stability of the NMJ. However, the contributions of MNs and muscle to these processes remain unclear, in particular the roles for retrograde signalling. It is quite well established that local RNA translation in the synapse is important for temporal control of protein synthesis and synaptic plasticity. The synthesis of many synaptic proteins is regulated by mRNA binding proteins including TDP43 and FUS, which are mutated in ALS and have modified subcellular localization. Thus, it seems that distinct changes take place in the axonal and somatodendritic MN compartments with disease. In this collaborative project we aim to unveil those changes by studying a compartmentalized in vitro model of the human NMJ. Using stem cell biotechnology and microfluidics we will develop this in vitro system where MNs and muscle are differentiated from healthy human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) or hiPSCs harbouring ALS-causing mutations in the SOD-1, TDP-43, and FUS genes, respectively. Using the microfluidics devices, MNs and muscle are restricted to different cell compartments and only connect through the motor axons recruited to the muscle side. Transcriptomic and proteomic signatures with this compartmentalized cellular resolution would reveal normal and altered events at the MN soma, axon and muscle levels. However, this approach strongly depends on isogenic hiPSC lines. Patient derived iPSCs and age matched controls cannot be used as different genetic background and unequal differentiation potentials introduce too much variance in the transcriptome and proteome to filter out disease specific alterations.While the Hedlund group has isogenic hiPSC lines for ALS-linked SOD-1 and the Ruepp group recently created isogenic hiPSC lines for ALS-linked FUS there are no isogenic hiPS cells with ALS-linked TDP-43 mutations available. Therefore, we plan during the international short visit to generate hiPS cell lines with ALS-linked TDP-43 mutations using CRISPR/Cas9. The Ruepp group has already established genome editing of hiPS cells and will teach Dr. Aguila Benitez (Hedlund lab) the required techniques. At the same time Dr. Aguila Benitez will help the Ruepp group to set up microfluidics for proteomic profiling from pure axonal preparations of MNs. The aim of this international short visit is to mutually transfer knowledge and materials required to create isogenic healthy and ALS-linked NMJs to address the pathogenic mechanism(s) involved in selective MN degeneration in ALS, and to initiate a long-term collaboration between the partner labs.

In host-parasite systems, one intriguing candidate for a molecular driver of co-evolution is the rather recently discovered âadaptive immune systemâ of bacterial pathogens, encoded in clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (cas) genes. This project will investigate the dynamics of host-parasite evolution in the natural epizootic caused by the bacterium Mycoplasma gallisepticum in the North American house finch population (Haemorhous mexicanus). Genomic characterization of house finch M. gallisepticum strains revealed patterns of CRISPR evolution that suggest altered phage parasite pressure on the bacteria after the switch from poultry to songbird host in 1994. At the same time, the observed degradation of CRISPR in M. gallisepticum also suggests that CRISPR maintenance might be costly to the evolution of virulence during adaptation to the new bird host, offering an alternative explanation for the apparent loss of CRISPR function. To understand the evolutionary dynamics between house finches and M. gallisepticum we need to establish which of these two evolutionary processes, if any, are the major drivers of the observed changes in the CRISPR-system in Mycoplasma. Thus, the two main goals of this project are to investigate (i) the drivers of CRISPR evolution (i.e. phages) and (ii) the consequences of CRISPR change for functional properties of the Mycobacterium genome that are important for virulence evolution.Currently, the biggest obstacle to addressing these goals is the lack of knowledge concerning the phages involved in the Mycobacterium-finch system. In a first step, I will map the geographic and temporal diversity of phages and bacteria throughout the epizootic in house finches. Then, cross-infection experiments with historical and newly sampled bacterial and phage isolates will provide functional tests of CRISPR variants and reveal co-evolutionary patterns between the phages and the bacteria. In a second step, I will explore the consequences of CRISPR degradation for the Mycoplasma genome by checking for genomic signals of increased virulence known to be associated with âpathogenicity islandsâ. By connecting the effects of phage diversity on CRISPR evolution in the bacterium with the effects of CRISPR variation to genomic virulence signatures, I will be able to link a specific molecular mechanism to the co-evolutionary dynamics within a natural system. Such a mechanistic understanding of virulence evolution will fill an important knowledge gap in our understanding of host-parasite co-evolution in nature and in particular for emerging infectious diseases, where ongoing evolution may complicate prevention or control measures.

This dramatic neuronal increase is accommodated in a small volume due to the evolution of gyrencephaly (cortical folding). Gyrencephaly is presumably driven by the selective enlargement of a secondary, basally located progenitor region, the outer subventricular zone (OSVZ). In this project I will test if TRNP1 and Ã-catenin, regulating progenitor abundance in mouse neocortex, affect progenitor growth in human OSVZ and respectively, cortical folding. I will also investigate how genes identified in gyrencephalic disorders contribute to cortical malformation. For this purpose, I will use novel human in vitro cerebral models, which can be derived from reprogrammed somatic cells. The expression of the target proteins will be modulated by combining the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing tool with established gene manipulation techniques. Apart from standard immunochemical methods, the dynamics of neuronal migration and abundance of distinct progenitors will be investigated by up-to-date in vivo imaging. Finally, the functional implication of downstream candidates identified by RNA-seq will be tested by overexpression/knockdown in the human cerebral model. Taken together, the project links innovative tools with proven methods to understand the most complex feature of the human brain, cortical folding.

303	Aregger Michael	Terrence Donnelly Center for Cellular & Biomolecular Research University of Toronto	2014-07-01	2015-12-31	Systemic analysis of the gene expression reprogramming induced by environmental stress in cancer cells	Cancer cells express an altered metabolism that is characterized by high uptake of nutrients and aerobic glycolysis, a process called âWarburg effectâ. While glucose is metabolised into lactate and thus diverted from the TCA cycle, glutamine is used to fuel the TCA cycle and to meet the high demand of nitrogen and carbon in rapidly dividing cells. As tumours grow, the continuous secretion of lactate lowers the pH in the tumour environment and the high consumption of glucose and glutamine may locally lead to nutrient deprivation. Therefore, I hypothesize that cancer cells that drive malignancy must possess an adaptable metabolic state allowing them to survive stress conditions. My studies aim to identify and characterize the reprogramming events that enable adaptation to environmental stress, such as glutamine deprivation or acidosis. There are two parts to my proposal. First, I will generate antibodies targeting human cell surface states specific to defined environmental conditions using a phage-displayed synthetic antibody library. The recognised cell surface proteins will be identified by mass spectrometry and the affinity reagents will be validated across a panel of cancer cell lines. Second, I will use the CRISPR-Cas9 system to perform genome-wide gene knockout screens for genes essential for adaptation to altered environmental conditions, as well as for genes that are required for the expression of stress-specific cell surface markers. Identified gene candidates will be further characterized using biochemical approaches and the therapeutical use of the identified sensitizers and regulators of stress will be explored.Together, these approaches will foster the development of new affinity reagents that can be used to mark cell surface features that are linked to environmental stress conditions, identify proteins that are functionally associated with specific stress conditions, and provide a detailed understanding of the genetic factors required for expression of stress-specific cell surface proteins. Furthermore, the proposed research will identify novel sensitizers and regulators of environmental stress and is expected to reveal novel drug targets and tools for cancer therapeutics.

Louis Pasteur HÃ´pitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg	2017-03-01	2018-08-31	Mechanisms of Staphylococcus aureus leukotoxins inducing ETosis	ETosis is a form of cell death where extracellular traps (ETs) are released by neutrophils and macrophages, contributing to the innate immune response. ETs are formed in response to bi-component leukotoxins (LukS-PV/LukF-PV for PVL and HlgC/HlgB for Hlg) of the Gram + bacterium Staphylococcus (S.) aureus, in order to trap and kill the invading pathogen. ETosis may thus, be beneficial for pathogenic infections, but may also present negative effects such as tissue damage due to inflammation or bacterial clearing of the ETs. Thus, as their precise role remains scarce, it is essential to understand the signaling mechanisms of ETosis and identify potentially different signaling pathways in response to the different leukotoxins. My objectives will be to identify differences in the intracellular signaling pathways during ETosis triggered by S. aureus leukotoxins (LukS-PV/LukF-PV and HlgC/HlgB), as well as by their cross combinations (HlgC/LukF-PV and LukS-PV/HlgB) to determine their specific roles. Transcriptomics will be applied for the analysis of these differences, followed by the Clustered Regularly-Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system for gene knockout in order to confirm the implication of specific genes in ETosis. This would shed light on whether only one or both proteins of these leukotoxins are responsible for the activation of different signaling pathways in ETosis. Finally, inhibitor identifications of this induced ETosis by targeting identified signals is essential for the prevention of severe tissue damage in response to S. aureus infections, as this bacterium is known for its DNase production, favoring replication through the released DNA from ETs. This study favors the discovery of specific signaling pathways during ETosis in response to bacterial toxins and the detection of well adapted inhibitors for ETosis. The study of host and pathogen factors involved in cell death resulting in extensive tissue damage may thus be facilitated, as well as the establishment of a therapy resulting in the bacterial clearance in some severe human infections.

305	Kruithof-de Julio Marianna	University of Berne	2016-12-01	2019-11-30	Phenotypic and genomic characterization of stem-like cancer cells surviving castration in human prostate cancer	Approximately a quarter of aggressive prostate cancers progress to a lethal disease due to the emergence of resistance to chemical or surgical androgen deprivation therapy. The cancer stem cell hypothesis proposes that a rare subpopulation of cells within a tumor possesses the key features of stem cells, namely self-renewal and multi-potency, and that these stem-like cancer cells arise from oncogenic transformation of normal stem cells or closely related multi-potent progenitors. Patient-derived xenografts of prostate cancer represent excellent models to explore the biological and molecular implications of the cancer stem cell hypothesis in the progression to castration resistant prostate cancer, and to identify key features of putative stem/progenitor-like PCa cells that are likely to be at its origin. Based on our previous work and on ongoing studies on normal prostate epithelial stem/progenitor cells, we plan to investigate the two following aims:1. To identify/characterize pre-existing stem/progenitor-like PCa cells based on differential resistance to castration for survival and/or growth2. To investigate the molecular phenotype and/or genetic switch that confers androgen independent growth in a pre-existing stem/progenitor-like PCa cellsThe phenotype, genomic aberrations and the functional role of stem/progenitor-like prostate cancer cells as tumor-initiating/re-initiating cells in castration resistant prostate cancer will be studied in two pairs of patient-derived xenografts. Each pair of patient-derived xenografts represents models either of androgen independent prostate cancer for survival, but not growth (BM18 and PC-82 models) or of prostate cancer independent for both, survival and growth (LAPC-4/-9). According to the selection model, castration/regeneration strategy will facilitate the identification/selection of pre-existing in vivo tumor re-initiating, stem/progenitor-like prostate cancer cells under androgen deprivation. A parallel castration/regeneration strategy for in vitro organoid-initiating cell(s) from cell subpopulation(s) surviving castration in the four patient derived xenograft models will further certify their stem/progenitor-like properties (self-renewal, expansion and differentiation) and characterize their phenotype. An unique set of markers (ALDH, CD44, CRIPTO and MCAM) will be employed for their identification/selection. A comparative, genomic and transcriptomic analysis of tumor re-initiating and organoid-initiating stem/progenitor-like prostate cancer cell populations from the two sets of patient derived xenografts will be then performed. Putative, castration resistant prostate cancer-âdrivingâ mutations found in LAPC-4/-9 will be assessed for functionality by genome editing (CRISPR-Cas9) in BM18 and PC-82.Our goal is to expand our understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling intrinsic resistance to androgen deprivation therapy. Such information will be important for understanding why prostate cancer relapse as castration resistant prostate cancer is invariably fatal and for developing better treatments for castration resistant prostate cancer. Additionally, these studies could lead to the identification of novel mechanisms of castration resistance that could be translated into biomarkers able to distinguish indolent from aggressive prostate cancer and provide surrogate end-point markers for monitoring prostate cancer treatments. The uniqueness of this proposal lies in: a) the assessment of the value of a novel stem/progenitor-like prostate cancer cell signature; b) the comparative phenotypic and genomic analysis of preclinical models, in vitro and in vivo, that differ in their capacity for growth progression under androgen deprivation; c) the reverse genetic approach on stem/progenitor-like prostate cancer cell; d) the evaluation of the prognostic value of the stem/progenitor-like prostate cancer cell signature(s) on tissue micro arrays.The proposed study may provide an invaluable translational tool for stratifying early-stage prostate cancer patients at risk of castration resistant prostate cancer progression. It may also propose novel therapeutic targets for a curative intent.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div. I-III)	429000.0CHF
306	Dettwiler Martina Andrea	Jonkers Laboratory Molecular Pathology Netherlands Cancer Institute	2015-09-01	2015-11-30	Genome-wide loss-of-function screens to identify platinum drug resistance mechanisms	Resistance to anti-cancer therapy is a major handicap in clinical oncology. Despite the benefit of chemotherapy, patients with disseminated solid cancers are usually not cured and eventually develop resistance to all drugs available. The precise mechanisms underlying resistance are often unclear, however. A good example are platinum-based drugs, such as cisplatin and carboplatin. They are particularly effective to treat patients with BRCA1/2-mutated breast or ovarian carcinomas. Due to the BRCA1/2 deficiency the tumor cells are unable to repair chemotherapy-induced DNA damage by homology-directed DNA repair and many tumor cells undergo cell death. However, most of the patients with tumor metastasis develop secondary resistance eventually. Moreover, many patients hardly respond upfront and only suffer from the severe side effects of the chemotherapy. Since the underlying mechanisms of drug resistance are not fully understood, the therapy response of the BRCA1/2-deficient cancers is difficult to predict. Several cases of resistance may be explained by secondary mutations that restore BRCA1/2 function, but these do not explain all cases of resistance.The goal of this project is to identify novel mechanisms that explain the poor drug response of BRCA1/2-deficient tumors. For this purpose genome-wide loss-of-function screens will be applied as an unbiased and versatile tool to search for new resistance mechanisms. The use of the new generation CRISPR-Cas9 screening technology allows permanent gene knockouts in diploid cells. By testing about 130,000 single guide RNAs that result in the mutagenesis of about 20,600 genes, the functional relevance of these genes on drug resistance can be tested. In this project, the genome-wide screen will be conducted on mouse cells derived from BRCA1/2-deficient mammary tumors using platinum drug selection. The advantage of these cells is that mechanisms of resistance can also be validated in vivo. This project will hopefully unravel new mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance, providing new targets for anti-cancer therapy. The broader understanding of therapy resistance will allow more tailored therapy possibilities increasing the patientâs benefit in terms of a better prognosis and less therapy side effects.

Currently, treatment options are very limited, and early educational intervention is the cornerstone for the management of cognitive impairment in most ND, indicating the positive effect of early actions during brain development. Among ND, Down syndrome (DS) is caused by the presence of an extra chromosome 21, and it represents the leading cause of genetically-defined intellectual disability. Different pharmacological treatments targeting one of the many pathways downstream of the triplicated genes have been shown to rescue cognitive impairment in DS animal models. Nevertheless, most of these preclinical studies have been performed postnatally and often in adults, possibly because of concerns of unwanted drug side effects that may have long-lasting noxious sequelae on a developing brain at embryonic stages. On the other hand, viral (but also non-viral) gene therapy approaches in animal models of ND have been mostly neglected because of technical and ethical issues, when considered in the light of future translational applications. Yet, DS is mostly diagnosed prenatally, when many of its brain developmental abnormalities originate. Here, we will investigate whether in utero manipulation of specific and possibly converging gene networks in neuronal progenitors of DS mice by CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology, may recover brain development and cognitive deficits later in life. Specifically targeting neuronal progenitors will allow us to act at early stages of brain development, while avoiding the involvement of genetic editing of germline cells and all related ethical issues. In parallel, we will also develop safer (viral-free) technological approaches for genetic manipulations in utero to minimize technical issues in the view of potential future translational applications.

Conventional transcriptional and functional profiling enabled by cell surface marker sorting has revealed a great deal about how specific cell types operate en masse, yet important transcriptional heterogeneity that exists within cell populations remains unexplored. High-throughput single cell RNA-seq can overcome this limitation by profiling entire transcriptomes of thousands of individual cells, revealing cell-to-cell variation by decoding patterns within populations masked in bulk transcriptomes. We will exploit this to dissect the mouse CD4+ T cell compartment, a heterogeneous white blood cell population that initiates adaptive immune responses. In AIM 1, we will chart the dynamics of in vivo CD4+ cell states in mouse before, during and after immune response challenges. By sequencing thousands of single cell transcriptomes, we will map the landscape of CD4+ T cell states in an unbiased, quantitative and comprehensive way. In AIM 2, we will predict key transcription factors, cell surface markers, and signalling molecules, including cytokines/chemokines in each cell state through novel computational approaches. Furthermore, our analyses will establish regulatory modules and networks of gene-gene interactions active in immune responses. In AIM 3, we will (a) confirm the in vivo impact of new cell states by performing adoptive cell transfer assays; and (b) validate our predictions of regulatory molecules and interactions using a massively parallel CRISPR/Cas knockout screen in vitro. This powerful integrated approach combines single cell RNA-sequencing, bioinformatics and genetic engineering to dissect CD4+ T cell states, a central compartment of mammalian adaptive immunity, and reveal basic principles of gene regulation.

In particular the goal of the Follow-up proposal for my AdvancedPostdoctoral Mobility (APM) fellowship is to finish and improve the work on the proposed aims,complete an exciting new collaboration that may lead to the identification of a novel diseasemechanism using the in vitro modeling technology and start the application process for runningmy own laboratory.The neurodegenerative/neurodevelopmental disease Familial Dysautonomia (FD) is being used to establish the principle of disease modeling in a dish as valid alternative/addition to animal models. The use of patient specific stem cells enables the study of human disease pathogenesis, primary chemical compound screens and the validation of existing drugs.In a set of elegant studies, the Studer lab has previously established FD-patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiated them into neural crest (NC) cells, precursors ofthe peripheral nervous system, specifically affected in FD. Characteristics of the disease detected in patients were reproduced in vitro establishing the first disease specific, iPSC-based in vitromodel of a genetic disease[1]. Furthermore, the partial rescue of disease phenotypes was achieved using kinetin, a plant hormone. Remarkably, kinetin has now moved forward into actual clinical trials for treating children with FD. Finally, the FD-iPSC model also enabled the first primary high-throughput drug screen in human patient-specific cells, a screen which yielded new drugcandidates with distinct therapeutic action and potentially higher potency than kinetin (Lee andZeltner et al, Nature Biotechnology 2012)[2].For my APM fellowship I proposed 4 aims and have completed 3 of them. Namely: Idemonstrated that the stem cell-based disease modeling system in FD is capable of modeling the differences in symptom presentation (severe, mild or absent) among FD patients. Fibroblasts ofthese FD patient groups were reprogrammed to iPSCs (Aim 1), differentiated in vitro and used to investigate three next steps to establish the hESC/iPSC-based disease modeling technologyfurther: 1. The sensitivity of the system to detect differences in patient's phenotypes in vitro.After establishing a more defined and faster differentiation protocol for the derivation of NC cells(Zeltner et al., JoVE in press), I show that the FD in vitro model can recapitulate varying disease severity reported in the different patient groups (Aim 2). 2. The potential of the technology forthe study of disease mechanisms and drug discovery. I show that patients with mild FDpresentation are able to generate the critical cell types, i.e. NC, peripheral sensory neurons(pSNs) and autonomic neurons (ANs) similar to those in healthy controls. However, I also foundthat the reason those patients suffer from FD is due to a neurodegenerative phenotype in thosecells based on cell survival studies in pSNs (Aim 3). For the extension of my APM fellowship, Ipropose to optimize the established differentiation protocol for generating ANs (Follow-up Aim 1) and to assess survival similarly for FD-derived ANs (Follow-up Aim 2). 3. The specificity ofhES/iPSC-based disease modeling in FD (Aim 4). Originally, I proposed to use the AAV-mediated gene targeting technology to genetically modify FD-iPSCs. After failed attempts to modify the cells, I generated one potentially targeted clone. However, this clone showed abnormal growthbehavior likely unrelated to any gene correction event. Accordingly, I refrained from using it anyfurther. Thus, for the APM follow-up, I propose to generate gene-edited, isogenic FD-iPSCs pairsvia an alternative and highly efficient technology based on the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. I have already built the necessary tools for use in FD-iPSCs. The resulting isogenic gene-corrected clones should provide the final proof that the FD in vitro model is faithfully and specificallyrepresenting FD (Follow-up Aim 3). Furthermore, establishing this state-of-the-art gene targeting technique will also be a valuable tool for my future independent career. In Follow-up Aim 4, Ipropose to finish a recently established, multi-institutional collaboration on the molecularmechanisms of why severe and mild FD patients present with distinct disease severity despite their identical genotype. This work goes beyond the goals initially proposed in my APM fellowshipand has the potential to offer unprecedented insights into the molecular mechanisms of FD, andtherefore should result in an additional key independent publication.*references can be found in the main proposal	Swiss National Science Foundation	Advanced Postdoc.Mobility	1980685.0EUR
310	Dr. TEICHMANN Sarah	ETH Zurich	2017-04-01	2019-03-31	Towards Therapeutic CRISPR/Cas9 Genome Editing	Targeted nucleases are widely used to modify the genetic information of organisms. Recently, the CRISPR/Cas9 bacterial immune defense system has been employed for genome editing, and has since largely revolutionized the field. The tremendous success of this system lies not only in its high efficiency, but also in in the simplicity of design. It uses short guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to specifically target the Cas9 nuclease to the desired DNA locus, where it generates double-strand breaks (DSBs). DBSs trigger repair by either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which is an error-prone process, or homology-directed repair (HDR), which enables the introduction of any desired base-pair changes.Numerous studies have already successfully used CRISPR/Cas9-meadiated gene editing to repair disease-causing genes in cell lines and model organisms, thereby raising hope for bringing therapeutic genome editing into the clinics. Unfortunately, however, these studies also revealed the limitation of this technology for in vivo gene editing approaches: in the majority of cases, CRISPR/Cas9-induced DSBs generate indels by NHEJ rather than precisely edited alleles by HDR. Because NHEJ is in particular prominent in quiescent cells, which do not express all the enzymes needed for HDR, novel systems that reduce NHEJ and induce HDR need to be developed to also apply CRISPR/Cas9 to in vivo gene editing in organs with slow cellular turnover rates.In the proposed project, we aim to develop a novel approach that enhances HDR repair of CRISPR/Cas9 induced DSBs in order to correct disease-causing mutations in the adult mouse liver, a tissue that is mainly quiescent. Considering that HDR is only active during the S/G2 phase of the cell cycle, we have recently engineered a Cas9:Geminin system which limits the generation of DSBs to phases when HDR takes place. We have already tested this approach in immortalized cell lines carrying a fluorescent reporter for NHEJ and HDR, and found that the ratio between HDR and NHEJ is indeed shifted towards HDR. In a next step, we would like to test this improved CRISPR/Cas9 system in vivo in the liver of mice that carry a similar fluorescent reporter for HDR and NHEJ. In addition to the blocking of DSB formation in quiescent hepatocytes, we will try to additionally boost HDR rates by treating mice with partial hepatectomy (PHx) after CRISPR/Cas9 component delivery, which ectopically induces hepatocyte proliferation. Finally, as a proof-of-concept study for therapeutic CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing, we will perforem long-term efficacy studies with these newly developed approaches to correct mouse models of the monogenic liver diseases phenylketonuria and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency.

Two important components of the HR pathway, BRCA1 and BRCA2, are frequently impaired in breast cancers. To specifically target the HR pathway, a novel therapeutic approach has been investigated: inhibition of the PARP 1/ 2 DNA repair enzymes induces lethality in BRCA1- and BRCA2-deficient cells but widely spares wild type cells. Despite the benefit of this and other DNA damage-inducing treatments, drug resistance remains a major obstacle in clinical oncology. In particular, mechanisms of therapy escape of HR-deficient tumors are poorly understood.In this project I aim to tackle the problem of drug resistance using a novel tool: at the Netherlands Cancer Institute I shall carry out loss-of-function genomic screens using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. For this purpose, I will use cell lines with large intragenic deletions of BRCA1/2 that cannot be restored. My hypothesis is that restoration of BRCA1/2-independent DNA repair is underlying drug resistance. I will therefore focus on a CRISPR/Cas9 library that targets about 500 genes that encode proteins involved in the DNA damage response.The Netherlands Cancer Institute is one of the world-leading institutes for cancer research. The group of Prof. Jos Jonkers has special expertise in large genome screening approaches using HR-deficient cells. I expect that the experience gained in Amsterdam will substantially broaden my knowledge. Moreover, I want to help establishing this revolutionizing technique when I am back in Bern. I hope that with this screening approach, I will identify new hits that explain why HR-deficient tumors acquire drug resistance.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Doc.Mobility	254922.0CHF
312	Dr. TEICHMANN Sarah	University of Lausanne	2016-11-01	2019-10-31	Mechanisms of basal and regulated mammalian RNA polymerase III transcription	RNA polymerase (pol) III synthesizes a collection of non-coding RNA molecules that are essential for cell metabolism. These RNAs include the 5S RNA component of ribosomes and all tRNAs, which are essential for translation, as well as several other RNA molecules involved in a wide variety of processes including processing of other RNA molecules and the control of pol II transcription elongation. Pol III recognizes three main classes of promoters, referred to as the class 1, 2, and 3 promoters. Whereas class 1 and 2 promoters are gene-internal, class 3 promoters are located in the 5â flanking sequences of the genes; they are highly similar to the promoters of small nuclear RNA genes transcribed by pol II, and they recruit several of the same transcription factors. The class 3 pol III promoters and the pol II snRNA promoters, which differ only by the presence or absence of a TATA box, thus constitute a nice system to dissect mechanisms leading to selective polymerase recruitment. In the first aim of this project, we propose to continue our studies to decipher the protein-protein interactions that lead to recruitment of the pol III-specific transcription factor BRF2 on class 3 pol III promoters, and the pol II-specific transcription factor TFIIB on pol II snRNA promoters.Pol III transcription is tightly regulated with cell growth and proliferation, and several factors involved in such regulation have been identified. One of these is a repressor called MAF1. MAF1 is inactivated by TORC1-dependent phosphorylation. Upon cellular stress leading to inactivation of the TORC1 pathway, it becomes dephosphorylated and can then inhibit pol III transcription by associating with the enzyme and/or some of its transcription factors. However, our recent results indicate that not all pol III genes are similarly down-regulated by MAF1. In the second aim of this proposal, we will determine whether pol III genes are brought together through three-dimensional chromosomal domains, and whether such domains contain similarly regulated genes. Down-regulation of the Maf1 gene in several systems leads to perturbations of lipid metabolism through mechanisms that are so far not understood. Our recent results have shown that MAF1 is a chronic down-regulator of pol III transcription rather than an acute repressor active only in response to stress, and that in a Maf1-/- mouse synthesis of tRNA molecules is greatly increased. Paradoxically, this leads to generally decreased rather than increased translation. We propose to examine whether much increased synthesis of tRNA molecules might lead to defects in tRNA modifications, themselves leading to defects in translation, and to characterize by ribosome profiling whether the translation defect is general or whether translation of some mRNAs is particularly affected. Several years ago, we noticed a mammalian interspersed repeat (MIR) present in an antisense orientation within the first intron of the Polr3e gene, which codes for one of the pol III subunits. This MIR was highly occupied by pol III and we noticed an accumulation of pol II at the end of the antisense MIR, suggesting that it might constitute a roadblock for pol II elongation through the Polr3e intron. We have used the CRISPR/Cas9 technology to engineer cell lines with a deleted MIR, and we observe increased expression of the POLR3E subunit. We will determine whether this leads to increased pol III activity in the cell, and we will compare the effect to that of deleting the Maf1 repressor gene. We will determine whether deletion of the MIR, or both the MIR and Maf1, has different effects on translation.This research will reveal mechanisms involved in the assembly of pol II and pol III transcription complexes and in the regulation of pol III transcription. It will further uncover an exciting new link between efficiency of pol III transcription, mature tRNA production, and translation, which opens up a new layer of gene expression regulation.

Although the number of HIV-related deaths has decreased continuously since its peak in 2005, curative treatments for retroviral infections are nonexistent, and it is estimated that up to 1.7 million people died from AIDS-related causes worldwide in 2013. Understanding the underlying biology of retroviral infections is fundamental toward developing successful antiviral strategies, such as preventive and therapeutic measures. The persistence of retroviral reservoirs in the cellular genome is challenging and has not been directly targeted by commonly used antiretroviral therapies against HIV. Animal models are needed to investigate host-virus interactions and to evaluate new therapies. As in humans, retroviral infections are prevalent in diverse animal species, including the domestic cat. The prevalence of feline leukemia virus (FeLV; a gammaretrovirus) infection in the cat varies greatly, depending on host age, health, environment and lifestyle. FeLV in cats is a well-established animal model for tumor and retroviral research that has been used for nearly 50 years1. After FeLV exposure, most cats develop a regressive FeLV infection, characterized by an early and efficient immune response mediated by neutralizing antibodies and FeLV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. This remarkable feature of FeLV infection in cats yields a great opportunity to study effective antiretroviral immune responses. However, approximately one-third of cats exposed to FeLV develop progressive FeLV infections with persistent viremia; these animals lack effective FeLV-specific humoral and cellular immunity. These persistently infected cats develop fatal FeLV-associated diseases, including lymphoma, leukemia, immune suppression and anemia, and they die within a few years of infection. It is very rare but possible for cats to raise a protective immune response and overcome persistent viremia on their own, even months after infection: we have observed full recovery from viremia in one cat more than one year after the onset of infection2. This proves that under the right circumstances recovery from an established progressive retroviral infection is possible. To date, no treatment regimen is known to cure persistent viremia in cats. In the present proposal, we aim to develop a method to aid cats in overcoming progressive infection-associated viremia by lowering proviral and viral loads. We will accomplish this by specifically destroying FeLV provirus in host cells using recently developed gene-editing technology in combination with oligonucleotide (ODN)-mediated immune system stimulation. We hypothesize that these measures will tip the virus-host balance in favor of cats, which in turn will be able to mount effective immune responses to overcome persistent viremia and subsequent infection-related fatality. We have shown that the use of CpG ODNs in cats is safe and results in decreased retroviral DNA and RNA loads in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)3. For gene editing, we will employ the RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease from the type II prokaryotic clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) adaptive immune system4. The efficiency, accuracy and simplicity of CRISPR/Cas9 makes it an extremely powerful tool that, when applied to the FeLV model, should yield an exceptional opportunity to investigate new anti-retroviral strategies in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Using CRISPR/Cas9 to delete or deactivate proviruses in the cellular genome offers the possibility of eliminating retroviral reservoirs from the genome, facilitating the treatment of retroviral diseases. The current application will address the above aim via two subprojects. In Subproject A, we will optimize a CRISPR/Cas9 system to introduce double-strand breaks into the FeLV provirus in vitro using FeLV-infected cell lines and PBMCs from experimentally FeLV-infected cats. We will assess the efficiencies of different CRISPR/Cas9 systems (targeting different sequences within FeLV) in introducing double-strand breaks that lead to nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ; SURVEYOR assay) and in reducing viral replication. In a preliminary experiment, we identified a target sequence within the capsid gene of FeLV that was most promising in reducing viral load. Additionally, in Subproject A, we will assess the safety of these systems in vitro. In Subproject B, we aim to construct a suitable gene therapy vector containing the CRISPR/Cas9 system for subsequent in vivo delivery (future project). The vector will be based on adeno-associated virus (AAV)5, and its safety and efficiency will be evaluated and tested in various cell lines and in PBMCs from experimentally FeLV-infected cats. Because the presence of pre-existing antibodies to AAV in a host6 may impact the effectiveness of gene therapy, we will also assess the presence of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies in pet cats in this subproject.A curative treatment for progressively infected cats is urgently needed in veterinary practice. To date, no effective treatment option has been offered to owners of FeLV-infected cats with progressive disease, leading to harm and suffering in both cats and their owners. Cats with progressive infections must be separated from other cats to prevent viral spread, and infected cats die from FeLV-associated diseases within a short period. As a non-ideal alternative, such cats can be euthanized upon discovery of infection, also causing distress and sorrow to pet owners.In addition to benefitting veterinary medicine, the results of the suggested project will also be of great interest to retrovirological researchers in general. In the current proposal, we suggest investigating the use of a gene-editing technology to destroy retroviral proviral DNA in an outbred animal. In contrast to mice and rats, cats have an average lifespan that enables the assessment of long-term efficacy. Furthermore, due to the different outcomes produced by FeLV infection and the possibility of mounting an effective immune response against the virus, the short-term efficacy of our approach will be immediately evident. While we recognize the differences between FeLV gammaretrovirus infection in cats and HIV lentivirus infection in humans, this natural animal model may yield proof-of-concept results regarding the efficiency of using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to target retroviral proviral sequences and reduce proviral loads in an outbred species. In contrast to HIV, the genomic sequence of FeLV is quite conserved throughout infection. Because the efficacy of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is largely dependent on matching gRNA to target DNA, applying it to treat FeLV is a promising strategy, and our goal should be attainable.Additionally, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has great therapeutic potential for treating latently infected cats, which parallel HIV-infected humans in several aspects. In cats with latent infections, the provirus reservoir maintains its full replicative potential even while suppressed by the immune system. Thus, if the immune system fails, reactivation of FeLV infection may occur7, similarly to what would be expected if antiretroviral therapy is halted in HIV-infected humans. Thus, the destruction of latent virus reservoirs in such cats is an ultimate focus of this proposal. This goal could be further addressed in future studies in cats with regressive FeLV infections. Finally, by surveying pet cats for pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to AAV, we lay a foundation for gene therapy in domestic cats.1 Willett & Hosie, Vet J 2013 195:16-23.2 Hofmann-Lehmann et al, Vet Immunol Immunopathol 1995 46:127-73 Robert-Tissot et, Vet Immunol Immunopathol 2012 150:1-94 Horvath and Barrangou: Science 2010 327:167-705 Kotterman & Schaffer.

A tremendous amount of work in the last decade has unraveled the basic concepts underlying their regulatory role in almost all physiological processes, however, we are far from understanding how exactly miRNAs are integrated into the regulatory circuits that ultimately control gene expression. Intriguingly, since MiRNA research has traditionally focused on the molecular events downstream of the miRNA, i.e. the identification of target genes that are actively repressed and thus establish a defined phenotype, the upstream regulatory networks that feed into miRNA activity have been largely neglected. With few exceptions, it is largely unknown which signaling cascades feed into the transcription of certain miRNAs and which transcription factors directly affect pri-miRNA synthesis. Second, we only have a limited understanding about processes that specifically regulate miRNA biogenesis. Third, we lack insight into how miRNA decay/turnover is specifically regulated and thus allows precise fine-tuning of active miRNA levels, warranting an in-depth analysis. To acquire a comprehensive understanding of the molecular components and mechanisms that and control miRNA activity, we plan to perform an unbiased whole genome CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss-of-function screen. Focusing on the clinically and therapeutically relevant miR-17-92 cluster as, we expect that this innovative strategy will unravel numerous novel general and miRNA-specific regulatory mechanisms that determine the level of functional miRNAs within a cell. Our work program is divided into three parts. In a first step, we plan to conduct several independent CRISPR/Cas9 screens to identify novel genes with a regulatory impact on miRNA activity. These screens are based on the direct quantification of changes in miRNA activity, which is accomplished by highly specific GFP-based sensors, in combination with fluorescent cell sorting. By using sensors for all members of the miR-17-92 cluster as well as several unspecific miRNA sensors, we expect to find novel genes implicated in general miRNA regulation, but also cluster-specific and even individual miRNA-specific regulatory genes. Second, we will validate and then characterize the most interesting candidate genes in more detail. In particular, we aim to pinpoint at which level these genes affect miRNA activity, and will use a combination of biochemical, genetic and molecular tools to unravel the mechanisms underlying their function. Last, we will test the top hits from the screen for their in vivo regulatory potential. To do so, we will manipulate the expression of such genes in an established adoptive transfer tumor model, the EÂµ-myc model of lymphoma, and will monitor whether this positively or negatively impacts disease onset and penetrance. Together, we expect that these studies will form the basis for a comprehensive understanding of the molecular events upstream of miR-17-92 both under physiological as well as under pathophysiological conditions. This will not only shed light onto the cellular networks that ultimately determine miRNA activity and thus shape gene expression, but may also lay the groundwork for therapeutic approaches that target miRNAs to manipulate disease-related transcriptional programs.

A tremendous amount of work in the last decade has unraveled the basic concepts underlying their regulatory role in almost all physiological processes, however, we are far from understanding how exactly miRNAs reprogram transcriptional circuits, fine-tune cellular behavior and impact on human disease. Here, I plan to provide a comprehensive functional in vivo analysis of the established tumor-suppressive miR-15 family, consisting of the three highly conserved miR-15a/16-1, miR-15b/16-2 and miR-497/195 clusters. Research in the past years has mainly studied the miR-15 family in the context of cancer, e.g. in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which is characterized by a loss of the miR-15a/16-1 cluster in about 60 % of all cases. However, little is known about its function under physiological conditions, warranting an in-depth analysis. Our own data in early B cell development as well as recent studies in NK cells, cardiomyocytes neurons indicate that miR-15 members are involved in tasks that are characterized by a delicate balance between proliferation vs. cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis vs. survival. Given its widespread expression in almost all tissues, we therefore hypothesize that the miR-15 family may function as a general regulator of tissue homeostasis, stem cell function or developmental processes. Intriguingly, mouse models for the deletion of either miR-15a/16-1 and miR-15b/16-2 recapitulate the human pathology and develop a CLL-like disease, but show almost no additional phenotypes, indicating that the miR-15 family can compensate for the loss of one or two members under homeostatic conditions in most tissues. Hence, all miR-15 family members may need to be targeted to provoke a strong effect on cellular function. To address this, we have used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to generate a mouse model for the conditional inactivation of all clusters, i.e. miR-15a/16-1, miR-15b/16-2 and miR-497/195. In this proposal, we plan to use this innovative model to decipher the functional role of the miR-15 family under physiological and pathophysiological conditions in vivo, mainly focusing on hematopoiesis and immune cell function as experimental systems. In particular, we will use flow cytometry for extensive immunophenotyping of all hematopoietic compartments in immune cell-specific miR-15 knockout mice, both throughout development and under steady state conditions. This will be complemented by functional assays to determine whether terminal differentiation and effector functions of immune cells are compromised. In addition, we plan to perform a thorough analysis of hematopoietic stem cell function to investigate whether miR-15 family members regulate the delicate balance of stem cell quiescence, expansion and differentiation. Beyond the immune system, we furthermore plan to pinpoint the role of the miR-15 family in non-hematopoietic tissues, e.g. during embryogenesis, and also want to determine whether loss of the miR-15 family promotes spontaneous tumor development or accelerate disease onset in cancer-prone mouse strains. Together, we expect that these studies will form the basis for a comprehensive functional understanding of the miR-15 family under physiological conditions in vivo, and will also allow a more precise assessment of its role in established or newly unraveled miR-15-related pathologies. In the long term, this may be crucial for the development of miRNA-based approaches to manipulate disease-related transcriptional programs.	Austrian Science Fund FWF	Stand-Alone Project	364019.25EUR

317	Dr Kilpinen Helena	University College London	2018-01-02	2020-01-02	Genetic background effects in human iPSCs and iPSC-derived cell types	Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) have emerged as a key model system to study the function of genetic variants, as they provide access to relevant cell types and developmental lineages through cellular differentiation. However, while it has been shown that the genetic background of the donor individual has an effect on molecular phenotypes measured from iPSCs, it is currently not known how much the genetic background influences studies that use iPSCs to model rare disease mutations, making interpretation of results challenging. In this project, I will use CRISPR-Cas9 technology to study specific rare disease mutations in different genetic backgrounds. Specifically, I will focus on loss-of-function mutations causing Kabuki syndrome, a disorder of the epigenetic machinery, and use patient-derived iPSCs together with engineered mutant and control lines to quantify the contribution of the genetic background on the transcriptome and epigenome of the iPSCs as well as neuronal precursor cells derived from them. This project will establish the value of using patient-derived iPSCs over generic iPSC lines with engineered mutations. This information is critical for the design of any subsequent studies in which iPSCs serve as the baseline, such as directed differentiation experiments and therapeutic targeting of the mutation.

It is activated by energy stress and phosphorylates several cellular targets involved in metabolism to shift the balance toward more energy production and decreases anabolic pathways. Several of these AMPK downstream effectors have been identified by the host laboratory in the last decade. In addition, AMPK also affects gene expression by direct phosphorylation of transcription factor and modulators. This has been well studied in yeast and plants, while transcriptional effectors of AMPK in mammals are less studied.In the present proposal, I intend to characterize new downstream effectors of AMPK in two important compartments for metabolism regulation: the mitochondria and the nucleus. To this end, I plan to use stable isotope labeling in mammals (SILAM) combined with phospho protein enrichment using 14-3-3 affinity purification to identify proteins that change in sub-cellular localization, abundance or phosphorylation status upon energy stress in wild-type livers but not AMPK KO livers in response to the AMPK-activating drug metformin. The candidates identified will be further analyzed by in vitro phosphorylation assays. Candidates that show direct phosphorylation by AMPK will be mutated in their phosphorylation site using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in mammalian cells to study their relevance to the adaptation to cellular stress in response to AMPK activation. Altogether, these experiments will allow me to identify new targets of AMPK involved in transcription regulation as well as mitochondrial function and will broaden our understanding of the way AMPK mediates adaptation to metabolic stress.

319	Dr Kilpinen Helena	Max-Planck-Institut fÃ¼r Infektionsbiologie ZellulÃ¤re Mikrobiologie	2015-02-01	2017-01-31	A genome-wide screen to identify effectors of extracellular trap formation in human neutrophils	Neutrophils are important mediators of antimicrobial defense as well as other immune processes. The cells are circulating at high numbers in the bloodstream, where they constantly control our body for infections. If neutrophils are activated by encountering a site of infection, they are able to respond to infecting microorganisms by a variety of defense mechanisms. One of these mechanisms is the release of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs), a structure of chromatin and attached proteins, which is expelled from activated neutrophils. The generation of NETs was discovered as a unique cell death pathway called NETosis and the released NETs are considered to trap and kill invading microorganisms. The mechanism underlying the process of NET formation is only poorly understood. This is in part due to the fact that neutrophils are terminally differentiated cells with a short lifespan. Therefore, genetic manipulations of isolated neutrophils are technically not feasible. This project aims to investigate the mechanism of NETosis by a genome-wide gene disruption screen. I previously established a cell culture system using a myeloid cell line, which can be differentiated into neutrophilic cells. These differentiated cells are able to form NETs and will be used to knock down or knock out genes by either RNAi or the newly developed CRISPR/Cas9 system, respectively. Genes, which are identified by this screen to influence NETosis, will be verified using different cell culture systems, such as hematopoietic stem cells with subsequent in vitro differentiation into neutrophils or human primary neutrophils. Target genes identified by the screen will also be verified in vivo in mice. This project will establish a method to analyze neutrophil-specific functions by genetic manipulations. Furthermore, the screen will help to understand the poorly characterized mechanism of NET formation as well as the in vivo impact of NETs during infection, which is of relevance for both basic and translational research.

320	Dr Kilpinen Helena	Ebert laboratory Brigham and Women's Hospital / DFCI Harvard Medical School	2017-03-01	2018-08-31	Generation of mouse models of acute myeloid leukemia for the identification of genotype-specific therapeutic targets	Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most frequent type of leukemia in adults with an overall incidence of 2-3 per 100,000 individuals per year. Disease course is usually aggressive and still only a minority of patients can be cured despite improvements in long-term survival rates over the past decades. With the advent of massively parallel (next-generation) sequencing the mutational landscape of adult de novo AML has been elucidated and this has led to a paradigm shift in the understanding of leukemia development. In contrast to the previous model of leukemogenesis that was based on the concept that mutations in signaling pathways (class 1 mutations) leading to uncontrolled proliferation must co-occur with mutations in transcription factors (class 2 mutations) leading to blocked normal myeloid differentiation, current data suggest a more complex molecular pathogenesis. Although the number of recurrently mutated genes in AML is relatively small and adult de novo AML genomes contain only 3-4 driver mutations on average, recurrent mutations affect genes with multiple cellular functions including transcription factors, epigenetic modification and RNA splicing. Mutations in TP53 which encodes the fundamental tumor suppressor p53 can be found in approximately 5% of de novo and up to 30% of therapy-related AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients and are associated with a particularly dismal prognosis with very poor long-term survival even in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.Thus, better pre-clinical in vitro and animal models are urgently needed to both study the molecular mechanisms of TP53-mutant leukemia as well as to identify synthetic lethal interactions that may represent potential therapeutic targets.To achieve this goal, I will combine several experimental strategies. In a first step, I will generate an isogenic cell culture-based model of TP53-mutant AML. In a second step, I will use various complementary experimental approaches including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, IP-MS and a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 in vitro loss-of-function genetic screen to identify potentially 'druggable' synthetic lethal interactions using the TP53-mutant isogenic AML cell lines. Last, I will use mouse models of TP53-mutant AML to validate putative therapeutic targets in vivo. The findings will not only be informative on basic principles of the pathogenesis of TP53-mutant AML, but importantly, may hold the promise to improve therapies for patients suffering from TP53-mutant leukemia.

321	Prof Cole Stewart	EPF Lausanne	2016-01-01	2018-12-31	From genome-derived knowledge to diagnostics for leprosy	This proposal builds on the results of a collaborative pilot project between Professor Cole's group at the Global Health Institute, EPFL, and Professor Moraes' group, the LaboratÃ³rio de HansenÃ­ase, at FIOCRUZ, that was pursued in the framework of the Brazilian Swiss Joint Research Project (grant number #0112-01). The previous investigation, entitled âComparative Transcriptomics of Leprosyâ, generated the preliminary data and main hypotheses that we now wish to test in a more ambitious, integrated manner. Leprosy is an infectious granulomatous disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae, which can result in severe disabilities in humans if diagnosed too late, this neglected tropical disease remains a global health problem and is of special significance in Brazil. Diagnosis is confounded by the many forms in which the disease can manifest and by the lack of universally effective, evidence-based diagnostic tools. At over 31,000 new cases, the incidence of leprosy in Brazil is the second highest worldwide, after India, and the number of relapse cases after multidrug therapy (MDT) is the highest in the world. In addition, the World Health Organization is concerned about multidrug-resistant leprosy in Brazil as MDT is the sole means of controlling the disease.In the present project, we will use hypothesis-driven research to underpin new interventions in support of public health measures to combat leprosy in Brazil and elsewhere. Our proposal, 'From genome-derived knowledge to diagnostics for leprosy' is built around three specific aims that are interlinked and explore the same cohorts of patients and controls. In specific aim 1, for which substantial progress has already been made, we will compare the host transcriptome in whole blood using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) between leprosy patients and healthy controls in order to identify genes that are differentially expressed; the products of such genes could later serve as specific biomarkers for active and latent leprosy. We hypothesize that patients with active disease will display a different gene expression signature to that of healthy subjects as has been reported for tuberculosis. The protocols have been successfully established during the pilot study and the first datasets generated. However, these were too small to allow statistical significance to be reached so we will now investigate larger groups of patients and controls. Validation of the best candidate genes will involve a two-pronged approach. First, gene expression will be monitored by RNA-Seq before, during and after treatment in a small group of patients. Second, candidate gene expression will be quantified in different groups of patients and healthy individuals using RTqPCR. Expression levels of the newly validated candidate genes will also be measured in a population of household contacts and the robustness of the approach challenged by measuring expression of the candidate genes in a blind test. The expected outcome is knowledge about genes/proteins that differentiate between disease, exposure and cure. This knowledge could later be translated into a diagnostic application such as an ELISA test that measures the levels of a specific protein in human blood or a point-of-care diagnostic test.Specific aim 2 is linked to specific aim 1 and involves genotyping the patients and their contacts by means of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in order to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the host genome or signatures in expression of genes and pathways. SNPs will also be surveyed in two household contact populations, one who developed the disease and one who did not. From the literature and our own results, we expect to uncover SNPs in genes for innate immunity such as PARK2, encoding the ubiquitin ligase Parkin, or the NOD2 pathway (NOD2, RIPK2, TNFSF15, and LRRK2). In parallel, based on the results of the integrative approach, we will analyze the function of these genes using an ex vivo system. Genome editing will be undertaken using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to introduce these mutations into human THP-1 cells. The THP-1 parent and the resultant mutant cell lines will then be infected with live M. leprae and the host response compared either by RNA-Seq or by using highly sensitive ELISA to measure the levels of cytokines/chemokines associated with innate immunity, such as the type I interferons. In this manner we will confirm causality between the SNPs discovered and susceptibility/resistance to leprosy. Furthermore, this approach will allow us to rank the candidate genes in terms of their power and functional importance. Once again, this information could underpin a diagnostic test for leprosy or exposure to M. leprae.Finally, to complete this investigation in Specific aim 3, we will attempt to correlate the genome sequence of the M. leprae strain from each patient with his/her disease state, haplotype and immunogenetics. We have recently optimized a DNA extraction method, which includes a step for host DNA depletion, that allows us to obtain near complete genome sequences from human skin biopsies in a cost-effective manner. From the genome sequences, we will then deduce the strain genotype, establish phylogenies and predict the drug susceptibility or resistance profiles. All the genome-derived information will be centralized in a web-based relational database that also contains details of the patient's case history and demographics.Based on the successful outcome of our earlier collaboration, we are fully confident that we can complete all three specific aims in the allotted timeframe as the foundations for the investigation have been laid and the cohorts of patients and controls established or identified. We anticipate that our integrated approach will lead to deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of leprosy and to bilateral transfer of technology. Furthermore, the subsequent translation of the results of our investigation into diagnostic tools can be envisioned and this may provide a response to an unmet medical need both in Brazil and in other countries where leprosy remains endemic.

The latter has a major impact on human health as it leads to about 250 million clinical cases of malaria and nearly one million deaths each year in endemic countries. To date, no malaria vaccine is available and increasing drug resistance is observed globally. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of these parasites, which would lead to the generation of new drugs or a vaccine, is urgently needed. Most Apicomplexa are obligate intracellular parasites that have developed unique modes of invasion and development within the host. Key biological processes and events in the biology of these parasites are enabled by a number of specific ultrastructural features. Invasive forms (zoites) are highly polarised cells, sharing an apical complex of specialised secretory organelles that facilitate successful invasion of the parasite into its host cell. Once inside their host cell, the mechanisms used by Apicomplexan parasites to replicate differ dramatically from those used by their hosts. Closed mitosis is combined with a budding process to produce variable numbers of daughter cells that do not derive from fission but instead are assembled within the mother cell. These fundamental differences between host and parasite suggest that cell division could be a potential target for therapeutic drug development.The present study will mainly focus on a putative serine/threonine kinase, named Tg269730 in Toxoplasma and PF3D7_1145200 in Plasmodium, that appears to be essential for parasite survival and whose localisation and expression profile implies a role in the biogenesis of the parasite invasion machinery during the budding phase of intracellular replication. To elucidate the function of Tg269730 and PF3D7_1145200, a series of genetic and biochemical experiments are planned to address the following questions:1) What is the subcellular localisation of Tg269730? Super-resolution imaging will be performed on a Toxoplasma strain that contains an epitope tagged form of Tg269730. Colocalisation using several established markers of parasite division and organelles will be used. In addition, immunoelectron microscopy will be performed on a similarly tagged synchronisable Toxoplasma strain. Live microscopic imaging will also be performed if a fluorescent protein tag is tolerated and does not alter the localisation of the protein.2) Does Tg269730 play a role in the lytic cycle? What is the functional role of Tg269730? To answer these questions, a conditional gene disruption (Tet-off system) as well as expression of a conditional dominant negative (destabilisation domain, DD system) will be used to examine the phenotypic consequences of loss of Tg269730 function.3) Is Tg269730 a bona fide kinase? A wild type or mutant (dead) kinase domain of Tg269730 will be expressed in recombinant form and its phosphorylation activity will be studied in vitro using biochemical approaches.4) What is the subcellular localisation and functional role of the Plasmodium orthologue, PF3D7_1145200? For this purpose an epitope tagged version of the kinase will be generated to P. falciparum using recently developed genetic tools (CRISPR-Cas9 system) and a conditional knock-out will be performed using the recombinase-mediated DiCre system. The phenotype resulting from the disruption of PF3D7_1145200 will be analysed by microscopic and videomicroscopic examination of the various developmental stages in the blood stage lifecycle. All the work will be performed at University of Montpellier where expertise in a wide range of techniques and analysis applied to the study of Toxoplasma has been demonstrated (Lebrun laboratory) and where novel tools to generate rapid genetic modifications in P. falciparum (CRISPR-Cas9 system) have been developed (Lopez-Rubio laboratory).

There is increasing evidence that the underlying cause of disease is a perturbation of earlier developmental processes, but the mechanisms of normal adolescent brain development are poorly understood. Here, I propose a project to decipher the genetic programs involved in the neural changes occurring during adolescence. I will focus my analysis on parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons in the mouse cortex, as this cell type is a likely important contributor in shaping the adolescent maturation phase. I will implement a recently developed method to generate quantitative RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from PV-interneuron populations from pre- and post-adolescent stages. Analysis of these data will reveal differentially expressed genes that might be responsible for adolescent changes in PV cells. Furthermore, to perturb the expression of the identified genes and their related genetic pathways, I aim to develop a platform for efficient, cell type-specific gene editing, using a virus-based Cre-recombinase (Cre)-dependent CRISPR/Cas9 system. The findings from the RNA-seq screen and the efficiency of gene editing will be validated experimentally by advanced in situ hybridization for RNA analysis. This project has the potential to uncover the genetic programs underlying the adolescent brain maturation process and to reveal novel targets for further functional analyses of neurodevelopment.

Defects are categorized primarily into three groups: developmental defects with a reduced number of beta cells, disruption of beta cell function or a progressive destruction of beta cells, mostly by defects in key regulators of autoimmunity. With the support of the SNF (Interdisciplinary grant CR33I3_140655) we have built a Swiss and international cohort of over 400 diabetic subjects, who are all genetically characterized (targeted next generation sequences, whole exome in selected cases). The approach by next generation sequencing yielded a high diagnostic rate of monogenic diabetes (MD) in 28% of the subjects, where we identi-fied known mutations and novel variants in the so called MODY genes (HNF4A, GCK, HNF1A, PDX1, HNF1B, NEUROD1, KLF11, CEL, PAX4, INS, BLK, ABCC8, KCNJ11). Confirming our ini-tial hypothesis that mutations in all genes controlling pancreas development and beta cell function could cause MD, we identified variants in additional 23% of the subjects of our cohort in 88 different genes (including KIAA2022). Based on these encouraging results we now propose the following hy-pothesis and related aims:PROJECT RATIONALE: In addition to the previous rational, we now extend our hypothesis to regulatory elements in noncod-ing regions contribute to the complex human diabetes phenotype in our cohort. We therefore propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: To investigate the unidentified families with a high probability of MD by whole genome sequencing, assess allele specific expression (ASE) and search for modifiers by RNA-Sequencing in the whole cohort. We will follow up on our cohort built with the previous grant and use cutting edge human genetics such as whole genome sequencing and RNA-Sequencing to investigate the complex mechanisms of diabetes. Aim 2: To functionally analyze newly identified genes involved in MD in vitro and in vivo by gen-erating a knockout mouse using the CRISPR-Cas9 technique.EXPECTED VALUE: We believe that our hypothesis is most efficiently tested with an interdisci-plinary approach, combining clinical endocrinology, human genetics and cell biology. Our results will help improve our understanding of the genetics and pathophysiology of underlying diabetes. If successful, we will not only extend the list of genes and noncoding regions causing MD but also provide insight into the physiology in human beta cell function. These results may help to identify novel targets to efficiently treat MD to prevent long-term complications in affected children. Moreover, the mechanistic insight may also serve to expand the therapeutic approaches to polygenic forms of diabetes. As proof of principle the results collected during the last funding period have led to critical adjustments of treatment for those participants who were initially misdiagnosed, improving their quality of life and hopefully prevention of long-term complications.

325	Boeck Lucas	Cambridge Institute for Medical Research University of Cambridge Cambridge Biomedical Campus	2016-06-01	2018-05-31	Identification, characterization and targeting of efflux pumps in Mycobacterium abscessus	Background: The prevalence of Mycobacterium abscessus, a rapidly growing non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) is increasing in the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) population. As a result of multidrug resistance, M. abscessus causes a chronic incurable infection in most CF patients and represents a major emerging threat to their health. Several efflux pumps have been identified in M. tuberculosis, where they have been proposed to impair mycobacterial killing, to cause macrophage-induced drug tolerance and may also promote mycobacterial growth in absence of anti-mycobacterial drugs. Inhibiting efflux pumps may thus favourably improve both, mycobacterial killing and drug susceptibility. Efflux pump inhibitors in combination with anti-mycobacterial drugs could potentially increase the number of effective drugs available and reduce treatment duration (currently averaging at over 2 years). However, the role and function of efflux pumps in M. abscessus is at present unknown.Aim 1: Identification of putative efflux pumps in M. abscessusApproach: Whole genome sequencing data of more than 1900 clinical isolates of M. abscessus is available at the CIMR / WTSI. All putative efflux pumps will be identified based on sequence homology. Furthermore polymorphisms will be assessed. Estimates indicate that M. abscessus has about 30-35 potential efflux pump genes. Genetic data will be correlated with clinical metadata to determine whether specific mutations are associated with clinical outcome and treatment response.Relevance: Putative efflux pumps of M. abscessus and their polymorphisms will be identified and associated with markers of clinical outcome. Aim 2: Characterisation of putative efflux pumps in M. abscessus Approach: Identified genes of putative M. abscessus efflux pumps will be knocked out using the CRISPR/Cas9 platform. Wild type and efflux pump knockout M. abscessus mutants will be challenged with anti-mycobacterial drugs and bacterial killing assessed, in broth culture and after macrophage infection. Relevance: Major efflux pumps affecting mycobacterial killing and tolerance will be identified using established high throughput methods of genetic editing and phenotypic analysis.Aim 3: Pharmacological inhibition of efflux pumps Approach: Specific and efficacious inhibitors of major efflux pumps in M. abscessus will be identified and tested in culture and macrophage experiments. Relevance: Efflux pump inhibitor plus anti-mycobacterial drug combinations that improve M. abscessus killing will be identified.Aim 4: Characterisation of the efflux pump expression in M. abscessusApproach: Efflux pumps will be tagged with fluorescent proteins using CRISPR/Cas9. Macrophages will be infected with M. abscessus GFP knockin mutants. The temporal dynamics of efflux pump expression will be assessed using live cell confocal fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry Relevance: Efflux pump expression in M. abscessus upon macrophage infection will be assessed and, in future, potentially manipulated.

Despite intensive treatment, widespread metastases are often unavoidable and the long-term prognosis is dismal in SCLC patients. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of SCLC metastatic dissemination will be the cornerstone for developing novel and more effective treatment. To facilitate dissecting the mechanism of SCLC pathogenesis, a genetically-engineered mouse model (GEMM) of SCLC has been developed, which bears close resemblance with human SCLC both in their genetic deregulation and in their highly metastatic nature. Herein, we propose the utility of this GEMM to identify driver mutations for metastasis. We will first harvest tumors from primary sites and from metastatic lesions, then perform exome sequencing to identify subclones in primary tumors which give rise to metastasis, followed by RNA sequencing to identify gene signatures associated with these metastatic subclones. Once the candidates are obtained, we will screen with the transplant model, by inoculating the mSCLC cell lines harboring a luciferase reporter allele into immunocompromised mice after manipulating the expression of interested genes. After subcutaneous tumor transplantation, the metastasis formation will be closely followed up by luminescence signals. Finally, we will validate selected genes from the screening and perform in vivo editing of these genes in the GEMM by the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, and follow up by microCT/MRI to assess if the burden of SCLC metastasis could be altered. With this project, we aim to identify and validate mutations driving SCLC metastasis, in the hope of developing new treatment strategies against such formidable disease.

However, the majority of MM patients that respond initially to proteasome inhibitor therapy develop resistance over the course of their disease, and ultimately die from PI-refractory MM. In a multicenter national phase II clinical trial performed within the SAKK, we have identified the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir as a drug with unprecedented clinical activity in PI-refractory MM (Driessen, 2016, ASH abstract 487). The molecular target and mechanism of nelfinavir activity against PI-refractory MM are unknown. Our unpublished preclinical data identify ER-resident chaperones, transmembrane transporters and mitochondria-related proteins as nelfinavir-binding targets and pinpoint the mechanism of action of nelfinavir to interference with ER-based protein transport or folding and energy metabolism.With the current proposal, we shall identify key cellular mechanisms affecting susceptibility of MM and PI-refractory MM to nelfinavir treatment using CRISPR-Cas9 genome-wide loss-of-function screening. To validate the role of certain candidate genes in nelfinavir sensitivity/resistance, selected candidates from the primary screen will be individually knocked-out using the targeted CRISPR-Cas9 approach. Such data are required from the international scientific community to support the development of nelfinavir towards clinical availability for MM, possibly outside the commercial setting. Our group is globally in the leading position to elaborate these.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Scientific Exchanges	4500.0CHF
328	Villiger Lukas	ETH Zurich	2015-11-01	2018-10-31	CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene therapy in liver stem cell organoids	We have recently established methods for in vitro long-term expansion of human adult liver stem cells. When provided with the proper growth factors, these stem cells grow into polarized epithelia which consist of proliferating stem cells and postmitotic differentiated cells. Importantly, stem cells in organoid cultures are genotypically and phenotypically stable, and can be genetically modified using genome editing tools. In addition, when orthotopically transplanted into mouse models they can readily integrate and generate functional epithelia, suggesting that organoids are promising for ex vivo gene therapy approaches.In a proof-of-concept work we recently corrected disease-causing CFTR alleles in intestinal organoids derived from cystic fibrosis patients using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool. However, although functionality of the repaired receptor could be demonstrated in in vitro assays, we did not proceed towards clinical application for the reason that cystic fibrosis is a multi-organ disease in which stem cells of several epithelial tissues would need to be replaced. Importantly, this hurdle does not exist for most metabolic liver diseases, in which the correction of the disease causing allele solely in hepatocytes would be sufficient to cure the specific syndrome. In addition, hepatocyte transplantations have been already successfully performed in the clinics as an alternative to whole liver transplantations.For these reasons we decided to focus on establishing an ex vivo clinical-grade gene therapy approach for inherited metabolic disorders in the liver. In particular, we will focus on Urea Cycle Disorder (UCD), which is an inborn monogenetic disease caused by the deficiency of one of the urea cycle enzymes. Our goal is to tackle UCD with an ex vivo gene therapy approach, in which liver organoids from patient biopsies will be established, repaired by CRISPR/Cas9, differentiated into hepatocytes which can be transplanted back into the patient liver to restore sufficient enzyme activity	Swiss National Science Foundation	MD-PhD fellowships (funded by SNSF)	180000.0CHF
329	Aregger Michael	Donelly Centre for Cellular + Biomolecular Research University of Toronto	2016-01-01	2017-06-30	Identification of genetic networks required for reprogramming of cancer cells in response to metabolic stress using next-generation CRISPR-Cas9 screens	A hallmark of cancer is the reprogramming of cellular metabolism in order to fuel growth and division. However, the rapid proliferation of cancer cells leads to several environmental stress conditions such as acidosis, hypoxia or local nutrient deprivation. In order to successfully establish tumor formation and metastasis cancer cells need to adapt to these harsh conditions and are required to rapidly reprogram gene expression in order to survive. The proposed research aims to identify the sensors and regulators of environmental stress conditions such as nutrient deprivation. Towards this goal genetic screens using the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas9 technology will be performed under various growth conditions and in different genetic backgrounds. The work of our lab and others have demonstrated that CRISPR-Cas9 gene knockout screens have the potential to discover near complete genetic pathways and are therefore expected to reveal regulators of stress-induced reprogramming at unprecedented depth. Candidate genes will be functionally characterized using biochemical assays and gene expression data. The unique combination of genetic screens, gene expression profiles and focused biochemical assays is expected to provide novel insight into the molecular mechanism of the reprogramming events required for cancer cells to adapt to metabolic stress conditions. Furthermore, the proposed research may reveal novel cancer therapeutic targets by highlighting genetic vulnerabilities associated with cellular metabolism.

330	Pilecka Iwona	University of Geneva	2016-03-01	2018-02-28	Identification and functional characterization of proteins involved in mitochondrial homeostasis	Efficient coordination between mitochondrial biogenesis and elimination through mitophagy is indispensable to allow the cell to adapt to changing metabolic demands. Disruption of this equilibrium leading to abnormal mitochondrial turnover has been associated with diverse pathologies, including cancer, Parkinsonâs disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Using a cell-based assay with controlled Parkin expression, I plan to identify novel essential players involved in Parkin-mediated clearance of mitochondria and/or in mitochondrial biogenesis. For this I will use the CRISPR/Cas-9 technology to screen the entire human genome for such proteins. Subsequent identification of target genes will be followed by functional characterisation of selected hits. The proposed project will lead to the discovery of new mechanisms governing mitochondrial homeostasis in mammalian cells, and may provide novel targets for biomedical intervention in diseases associated with impaired mitochondrial function.

The structure of this map affects evolutionary dynamics and has important consequences for the predictability of evolution, speciation, and the evolution of mutational robustness, genetic recombination, and evolvability. Establishing the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes or fitness is not just a basic pursuit, but also one that has highly important practical implications in medicine and biotechnology, where we need to accurately predict the fitness effects (positive and negative) of human mutations or engineered genome modifications. However, at present, our knowledge of this relationship in practically all living systems is very poor. Having worked during my PhD on a genotype-phenotype map using computational approaches, in this project I intend to leverage recent advances in DNA synthesis, high-throughput sequencing, and DNA barcoding to go a step further and approach this question experimentally in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. My goal is to study how the fitness effects of mutations in important biological modules of a cell change with the environment and the genetic background. Specifically, I will study the signal transduction Ras/PKA and TOR/Sch9 pathways, which are commonly mutated during laboratory evolution experiments, and control cell growth in response to many different nutrients. Mammalian homologs to many genes in these pathways are oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, and are very commonly mutated in human malignancies. I plan to address my goal by undertaking two specific aims:1. Mutational scanning of two major signaling pathways in adaptive evolution. I will map the fitness effects of >50,000 mutations in the coding regions of the Ras/PKA and TOR/Shc9 pathways. To do this, I will employ a cutting-edge CRISPR-based method that permits combined editing of multiple loci at single-nucleotide resolution on a genomic scale and high-resolution barcode-tracking of these edits in a cell population. I will analyze the distribution of fitness effects across different selective environments. As a point of comparison, I will also assay a large number of variants segregating in natural populations of S. cerevisiae and different Saccharomyces species. Many components of these pathways are targets of Hsp90, a molecular chaperone that has been proposed to modulate the genotype-fitness map. Therefore in these experiments I will also investigate the impact of Hsp90 activity (using multiple structurally distinct inhibitors such as geldanamycin and radicicol) on the fitness of the variants.2. Investigate the impact of epistasis in the evolution of these pathways. Epistasis means that the effect of a mutation depends on the genetic background in which it occurs. The extent to which epistasis shapes adaptive evolutionary trajectories has been vigorously debated. My objective here is to experimentally test epistatic interactions between pairs of adaptive mutations in the Ras/PKA and TOR/Shc9 pathways using the same CRISPR-based method. Mapping epistatic interactions between pairs of mutations in different selective environments will allow me to answer fundamental questions regarding epistasis, such as how the intensity of epistasis change as a function of the environment, or the prevalence of different types of epistasis.As this project requires an integrative approach incorporating the mechanistic perspective of systems biology into an evolutionary framework, I propose to carry it out jointly in the laboratories of Prof. Daniel F. Jarosz (systems biology) and Prof. Dmitri A. Petrov (evolution), both at Stanford University. The proposed project constitutes a major step forward toward the acquisition of the technical competencies to become an independent researcher in the field of evolutionary systems biology. At the same time this research plan represents an innovative approach to studying a problem that goes beyond this basic field and has broad implications for human disease and genome engineering alike.

332	Olias Philipp	University of Berne	2018-03-01	2022-02-28	Theileria effectors transforming host cells into cancer-like cells	Theileria is a genus of tick-borne parasites which are closely related to other apicomplexan parasites of medical importance such as Plasmodium, Cryptosporidium and Toxoplasma. The two most important species, Theileria annulata and Theileria parva cause tropical theileriosis and East Coast fever (ECF) in cattle, respectively. T. parva alone is estimated to account for the death of >1 Mio cattle each year in sub-Saharan Africa with a substantial socio-economic impact and loss of US$ >300 Mio. One of the hallmarks of disease is the proliferation and dissemination of infected host cells into various organs. After tick transmission of sporozoites, leukocytes get invaded, followed by the development of schizont-forming parasites, and host cells acquire properties otherwise only known from cancer cells such as resistance to apoptosis, uncontrolled proliferation and metastatic potential. Despite considerable research efforts to link phenotypic changes and perturbed host cell signaling pathways, TaPIN1 is the only characterized Theileria effector protein to date that has been shown to contribute to host cell transformation. This absence of knowledge can mainly be attributed to a lack of genetic tools and a Theileria genome of ~4000 genes, half of which have no predicted function. In contrast, an arsenal of effector proteins has been discovered over the past decade in the highly tractable Toxoplasma system that hijacks host signaling pathways and takes control over gene expression. We aim to identify and characterize the function of novel Theileria effector proteins and explore how they interfere with cell signaling pathways and gene regulation that promote host cell transformation. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of genomic-scale analysis, the power of CRISPR/Cas9-based reverse genetics, a high throughput pathway analysis panel, life cell imaging and mass spectrometry. The specific aims of this proposal are (1) Identification of Theileria effector proteins and associated host cell manipulation; (2) CRISPR-based knockout of identified effector proteins; (3) Characterization of the host-pathogen protein interaction network. The characterization of novel Theileria effectors will be a fundamental step forward for the understanding on how Theileria transforms cells and causes disease. This knowledge may lead to improved interventions designed to reverse host cell transformation, thereby improving immune control of Theileria infection. It may also add new insights into cell physiology and pathway alterations in cancerous cells.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Ambizione	895928.0CHF

This proposal aims to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying the substantial phenotypic variability observed in Joubert syndrome (JBTS), a neurodevelopmental Mendelian disorder part of the ciliopathy spectrum. To achieve this goal, the first step of the proposed research plan combines two experimental models with complementary strengths, namely zebrafish mutants and CRISPR/Cas9 genome-edited human induced-pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons, to compare the molecular consequences of loss-of-function in 4 different JBTS genes. This will untangle the shared effects of their loss-of-function from their diverging gene-specific effects. Second, I will take advantage of the variety of cilia-types present in zebrafish, mirroring the situation in humans, to investigate tissue-specific functions for each of the 4 genes. Finally, by generating zebrafish mutants carrying mutations in more than one gene, I will determine the combined effect of these mutations on the phenotypic outcome to investigate genetic modifiers. The enhanced understanding of the molecular consequences of JBTS gene mutations resulting from this work will increase our predictive ability for individual patients and set the stage for development of specific therapies.

During development, liver progenitors collectively move to form an organ primordium, where they differentiate into polarized epithelial cells. How progenitors actively self-organize and which factors are required in those processes is poorly understood, but pre-requisite for efficient stem cell differentiation and tissue engineering. I propose to pioneer a live imaging protocol to study at single cell resolution, how liver progenitors assemble into an organ in zebrafish embryos, transitioning from migratory into polarized cells. To carefully track and segment cell shapes over time, I plan to generate a next-generation four-color labeling system to mark, in a mosaic fashion cell membranes and/or nuclei of any given tissue. By combining this system with spectrally compatible GFP lines, labeling neighboring tissues or polarized hepatic proteins, I will analyze which specific cellular behaviors and tissue-tissue interactions control the three-dimensional organization of liver architecture.Preliminary results indicate that ubiquitous or restricted localization of transmembrane protein EphrinB1 is essential for progenitor cell motility and differentiation into mature hepatocytes. To assess whether differential EphrinB1 localization is associated with different molecular functions, I plan to analyze its role at different stages of liver morphogenesis. For this, I will generate conditional EphrinB1 mutant alleles, using CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering, and identify signaling targets and interactors by transcriptome and proteome analyses of isolated liver cells.

335	Yousefi Shida	University of Berne	2017-05-01	2021-04-30	Molecular mechanisms of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation	Background: The precise nature of anti-bacterial and anti-fungal inflammatory responses has not yet been completely defined. Besides intracellular killing, neutrophils are able to exert an antibacterial effect in the extracellular space by forming so-called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) containing released DNA and granule proteins. These represent an important antimicrobial function of neutrophils, as well as a phenomenon contributing to the perpetuation of inflammation. Despite its clear clinical relevance, little information is available regarding mechanisms underlying NET formation. There is an urgent need to dissect the molecular mechanism of NET formation, partly because of the intense debate about the origin of the released DNA in NETs and about a requirement for cell death for NET release, but more importantly because recent reports indicate the important role of mtDNA in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematous (SLE). Therefore, progress in finding drugs to minimize immunopathology in such autoimmune diseases depends on understanding these mechanisms.Hypothesis: Extracellular DNA trap formation is a programmed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) expulsion, which forms a DNA matrix associated with released granule proteins. The formation of NETs requires the active participation of molecules regulating mitochondrial dynamics and the cell cytoskeleton. We hypothesize that for NET formation cytoskeletal rearrangements such as actin polymerization and microtubule (MT) network formation are necessary for the directed transport of mitochondria and granules towards the plasma membrane. In addition, we have data indicating that mitochondrial dynamics, namely mitochondrial fusion, is essential for mtDNA release, underlining the active role of mitochondria during NET formation. Moreover, extracellular calcium influx is required for the formation of NETs, and we have identified a responsible calcium channel required for NET formation. Specific aims: We aim to better understand molecular mechanisms for mtDNA and granule protein release during extracellular DNA trap formation in neutrophils.AIM 1: Active participation of the cell cytoskeleton in NET formation will be studied using pharmacological and genetic approaches. Primary mouse neutrophils genetically deficient in actin polymerization, i.e. lacking the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) or Glutaredoxin 1 (Grx1) enzyme will be used to analyze the role of actin in NET formation. High-end microscopic techniques (3D-scanning electron microscopy) will be applied to envisage the details of DNA expulsion.AIM 2: Our shRNA-screening results have identified a mitochondrial fusion protein [optic atrophy-1 protein (Opa1)] as candidate gene directly responsible for MT network formation and mitochondrial mobilization leading to NET formation. Conditional knockout Opa1 (Opa1N?) mouse neutrophils as well as patientsâ neutrophils deficient in functional Opa1 [autosomal dominant optic atrophy disease (ADOA)] will be used to dissect the mechanism of mtDNA release. To study the direct role of MT, we will apply the novel approach of in vivo conditional / inducible CRISPR/Cas9 tubulin knockout mice to delete specific microtubule genes up-regulated in mature activated neutrophils in an inducible and conditional manner. AIM 3: We have obtained evidence that the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel is present in neutrophils and is required for NET formation. Using BK-/- neutrophils, we plan to dissect the function of extracellular calcium flux and its role in temporal activation events in NET formation.Wider scientific context: mtDNA is now recognized as a key immune regulator. Autoantibodies against oxidized-mtDNA are detected in systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) patient' sera. A better understanding of the mechanisms of mtDNA release during neutrophil activation and NET formation will lead to new insight into its role under physiologic and pathologic condition, and provide molecular target (s) for improved anti-inflammatory therapy.

Changes in gene expression are the first immediate readout of genetic variants, and the dynamics, magnitude and variability of the changes are what leads to diversity in complex traits. Here we want to determine features (such as genomic distribution, effect size and location relative to the transcripts they influence) of genetic variants that affect dynamic gene expression after an environmental shift, and the mechanisms how they lead to differential dynamics. To this end we apply a combination of approaches: i) QTL mapping to identify genomic regions that enable faster adaptation to a new environment via differentially affecting transcript dynamics, ii) developing a computational framework for identifying molecular mechanisms that underlie these differential transcript dynamics and iii) exploit the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate single nucleotide exchanges for fine-mapping of causal alleles.

337	Vonesch Sibylle	Genome Biology Unit European Molecular Biology Institute EMBL	2018-02-01	2019-07-31	Dissecting genetic interactions underlying complex traits via systematic genome editing	A major challenge for understanding phenotypic diversity and enabling precision medicine is improving our currently very limited ability to predict phenotypic outcomes based on genome sequence and environmental context. Our lack of knowledge on the functional consequences of the vast majority of genetic variation is one of the fundamental problems impeding such endeavors. While naturally occurring variants have the most relevance for explaining phenotypic diversity, systematic genome perturbations have primarily been focused on large-effect alleles, such as gene deletions. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping have addressed the role of natural variation in conditioning complex traits, but these approaches are limited by the haplotypes present in the population and are poorly equipped to detect interactions between loci - situations where the effect of one variant is masked or enhanced by another variant. It has become clear that a comprehensive view of genetic variation and its role in shaping phenotypes requires systematic perturbation of each variant in different genetic and environmental contexts. Recent advances in genome engineering now make such an approach possible. Here I propose to systematically engineer and phenotype naturally occurring single nucleotide variants and small insertion-deletion polymorphisms in three distinct Saccharomyces cerevisiae backgrounds. The strains will be constructed by a high-throughput CRISPR approach that allows creation of thousands of barcoded and sequence-verified variant strains simultaneously. I will profile strain pools in multiple environments, identifying those variants that modulate fitness in a given environment and genetic background by next-generation sequencing of genomically integrated DNA barcodes. To map pairwise and higher-order interactions I will then directly engineer variant combinations and assay their impact on cellular processes and fitness. The work in this proposal will be an important contribution towards understanding the phenotypic landscape governed by natural variants and their interaction with each other and the environment. Due to the conservation of fundamental cellular processes, the here identified principles underlying allelic interactions will allow valuable insights into the organizing principles of cellular systems. By enabling the interpretation of genetic variation in specific biological and environmental contexts these insights lay the foundation for efforts to predict the phenotype of a cell based on its genotype and environment alone.

Symmetrically divergent copy number variations of the 7q11.23 chromosomal region display symmetrically opposite phenotypes with regard to social facets of brain function. Hemizygous deletions cause WS, characterized by excessive friendliness, unreserved behavior around strangers, an engaging personality and striking verbal ability. Duplications of the region resemble autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with impaired social interactions and language deficits. Thus 7q11.23 represents the source of a cognitive axis that determines facets of human social behavior. Based on previous findings in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC derived neurons, we hypothesize that the WS deletion results in premature cell cycle exit and apoptosis of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) that lead to altered micro-circuitry as the brain develops. The basis for these disruptions has been attributed to haploinsufficiencies of BAZ1B, GTF2I or FZD9, three genes contained in the deleted region. We will seek additional evidence for developmental dysfunction related to these genes by RNAseq of cerebral organoids.(1) Generation and microscopic analysis of patient-derived cerebral organoids. We will generate iPSC derived brain organoids from WS patients, carriers of 7q11.23 duplication and control individuals. We will use clearing procedures (CLARITY) to define the developmental laminar organization by comparing cell content and thickness of ventricular zone and the outer subventricular zone. Relative abundances of cell types, numbers of apoptotic cells and the balance between proliferation and differentiation will be determined semiquantitatively by immunohistochemistry, pulse-chase experiments and FUCCI labeling to quantify phases of the cell cycle in the samples.(2) Single-cell RNAseq profiling of cerebral organoids. Drop-seq will be utilized to corroborate altered cell type abundances, and resolve transcriptional changes to the level of cell types in the developing brain. This will again test our hypothesis of incomplete differentiation, and reveal many novel transcripts relevant to WS and 7q11.23 duplication syndrome.As a future direction, we will determine the contribution of BAZ1B, GTF2I and FZD9 haploinsufficiencies to WS and 7q11.23 duplication syndrome. CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing will be used to generate heterozygous loss-of-function alleles for BAZ1B, GTF2I and FZD9 in control iPSCs. Cerebral organoids grown from these genetically engineered cells will be analyzed as described in (1) and (2) and the extent to which they recapitulate the WS neuro-phenotype will be determined. Together, the proposed experiments will provide a comprehensive picture of WS and 7q11.23 duplication syndrome that will link the known genetic defect to a cellular phenotype.

GG-NER is a versatile âbig enzymeâ machine that safeguards the genome by removing bulky DNA adducts induced by genotoxic agents like UV light, chemical carcinogens, chemotherapeutic drugs and oxygen radicals. To be effective, this repair machine must cope with the condensation of its chromatin substrate where DNA is tightly wrapped around histones giving rise to nucleosome arrays. Our preceding work provides strong evidence for a novel role of the histone methyltransferase KMT2H in GG-NER reactions in chromatin. Working hypothesis:- Chromatin cannot simply be considered as an accessibility barrier but contributes to the damage response by priming damaged sites for DNA repair activities.- Three main molecular factors prime chromatin for DNA repair: histone modifications, histone variants and ATP-dependent remodeling.- Histone methyltransferases are key modifiers promoting DNA damage recognition in the GG-NER process.Specific aims: This project is focused on how histone methyltransferases regulate GG-NER reactions in the packed human genome. We will analyze GG-NER activity in living cells to determine the role of (i) methyltransferases that add chromatin-relaxing methyl groups to histones (for example to H3 at position K4) (ii) methyltransferases that add chromatin-condensing methyl groups to histones (for example to H3K9), (iii) chromatin remodelers like the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) family known to be recruited or activated by histone methylation. Experimental design: We established activity assays and fluorescence-based imaging methods to monitor NER reactions in human cells. For screening, histone-modifying enzymes will be down regulated using RNA interference. For confirmatory and mechanistic studies, we will employ cells with CRISPR/cas9-induced gene deletions or mutations. The assembly of GG-NER complexes will be evidence in situ by visualizing the relocation of repair subunits to UV lesion spots. To study the assembly of GG-NER complexes in the nucleosome landscape, chromatin will be solubilized and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against histones/modified histones. Composition of immunoprecipitates will be analyzed by targeted (immunoblotting) and untargeted (mass spectrometry) methods. Supporting flow cytometry experiments, cytotoxicity tests, colony-forming and comet assays will be performed for cell cycle, viability and genome stability analyses.Expected value: Due to the very high frequency of damages that the GG-NER machine needs to process simultaneously (hundred thousand or more DNA lesions in a single genome), this reaction provides a unique model system to understand how nucleosome dynamics and DNA accessibility are regulated on a global scale in the chromatin of human cells. This project, therefore, paves the way to novel pharmacologic strategies that stimulate or inhibit nucleosome fluctuations using emerging methyltransferase or demethylase inhibitors, particularly with the intent of sensitizing cancer cells to radio- or chemotherapy.

340	DÃ©glon Nicole	University of Lausanne	2016-04-01	2019-03-31	Gene editing for Huntington's disease	Huntingtonâs disease (HD) is a rare neurodegenerative disease caused by a pathologic CAG expansion in the exon 1 of the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Aggregation and abnormal functions of the mutant HTT (mHTT) cause motor, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms in patients, which lead to death in 15-20 years. Currently, there are no curative treatments for HD but experimental approaches based on drug, cell and gene therapy are under investigation. Among them, mHTT silencing using small hairpin RNA (shRNA) displays important physiopathological benefits but requires long-term and continuous treatment and is leading to a partial HTT silencing. The recently described method based on the bacterial clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system is a promising tool for gene editing in mammals and offers a unique opportunity to investigate a therapeutic strategy based on DNA modifications. In this project, we propose to use the CRISPR technology for gene editing and repair of HD mutation. Both, in vitro and in vivo experiments will be performed to validate various strategies of mHTT gene editing. Aim 1: Disruption of HTT geneNon-allele inhibition of HTT transcription a.Screening in vitro to select sgRNA with high DSB efficiency b.On and off-target effects in iPS cells c.Functional validation in HD neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) d.In vivo efficacy in HD animal modelsAllele-specific disruption of HTT e.Screening in vitro to select sgRNA with high DSB efficiency f.On and off-target effects in iPS cells g.Functional validation in iPS cells h.In vivo efficacy in HD animal modelsAim 2: HD gene repairReplacement of the pathological CAG expansion by a WT CAG repeat a.Evaluate HR in primary neuronal cultures with a validated sgRNA (sgHTT1) and various donor sequences and delivery conditions b.In vivo efficacy in HD animal models	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div.

There is accumulating evidence that genomic non-coding, distant-acting regulatory modules contribute significantly to human disease. However, links to mechanistic processes are very difficult to establish, since a significant proportion of the gene regulatory sequences located in the 98% non-coding portion of the human genome remains unannotated. Enhancers are the major cis-regulatory modules directing tissue- and cell type-specific gene expression and therefore essential for organ formation and morphogenesis. Although next-generation sequencing approaches have uncovered genome-wide enhancer signatures in human and mouse developing hearts, the enhancer and transcript profiles underlying distinct cardiac cell types have remained elusive. Therefore, I am harnessing a new method termed INTACT in combination with next-generation sequencing based technologies to identify the genome-wide epigenomic and transcriptome signatures present in cardiac cell types and subregional cell populations. Correlation of these profiles will allow the discovery of shared and unique regulatory programs and has the potential to identify novel cardiac subtypes. I will use large-scale transgenesis as a gold-standard method to expand the catalogue of subregional heart enhancers and leverage a high-throughput CRISPR/Cas9 injection pipeline to study the function of cell type-specific cardiac enhancers in vivo. The proposed research will reveal the regulatory landscapes of developmental cardiac cell types and dissect the functional properties of heart enhancers to advance the understanding of the molecular etiology of cardiac pathologies.

Significance: Many childhood cancers exhibit widespread epigenetic aberrations, including changes in DNA methylation and in histone marks. This is in stark contrast to their low frequency of genetic defects, and it suggests an important functional role for epigenome deregulation in these cancers. I have recently described massive changes in histone acetylation and genome-wide enhancer reprogramming for Ewing sarcoma, a difficult-to-treat pediatric tumor. In this project, I will investigate the hypothesis that Ewing sarcoma is an enhancer disease, characterized by highly orchestrated reprogramming of genome-wide histone acetylation patterns. This work will advance our understanding of Ewing sarcoma and of the epigenomeâs role in pediatric cancers. It may also provide a molecular basis for pursuing epigenome editing and enhancer targeting and as new therapeutic strategies for Ewing sarcoma. Innovation: The proposed project focuses on a largely unexplored area of Ewing sarcoma research. Using the latest epigenome mapping technology, it will be possible to map and classify all enhancers that are driven by the oncogenic fusion protein EWS-FLI1. Furthermore, chromatin 3D mapping and bioinformatic analysis will connect the enhancers to their target genes genome-wide, and selected enhancer-gene links will be validated by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. I will also confirm the role of Ewing sarcoma specific enhancers in primary samples, using a cohort of 141 Ewing tumors for which I have already completed genome-wide DNA methylation sequencing. Approach: Aim 1. EWS-FLI1-driven enhancer landscape: Comprehensive mapping and integrative analysis of histone acetylation patterns and enhancer binding proteins in cells with tunable EWS-FLI1 expression Aim 2. Regulatory impact of EWS-FLI1-driven enhancers: Connecting Ewing sarcoma specific enhancers to their target genes via chromatin 3D structure mapping, CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, and enhancer RNA knockdown Aim 3. Enhancer activity in clinical samples: Correlating EWS-FLI1 driven enhancer activity to patient-specific gene expression profiles and clinical outcome in primary Ewing sarcoma tumors Environment: This project will be conducted in the laboratory of Prof. Heinrich Kovar at the St. Anna Childrenâs Cancer Research Institute (CCRI) in Vienna. The CCRI is Austriaâs leading center for research on pediatric cancers and affiliated with the Medical University of Vienna. I will also collaborate with leading scientists in France (Olivier Delattre, Curie Institute), Austria (Christoph Bock & Keiryn Bennett, CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine) and the UK (Stephan Beck, University College London). Alignment with Funding Strategy: The proposed project addresses all goals of the Elise Richter Program: (i) it fosters career development of a qualified female scientist in Austria; (ii) the research program will establish the candidateâs scientific independence; (iii) the candidate provides a concrete career plan for becoming a principal investigator; (iv) the candidate pursues habilitation as the formal qualification for assistant professors in Austria.

Kinases are a group of enzymes that play a pivotal role in orchestrating the DNA-damage response, yet taken as a whole, the kinase family is largely understudied. To better understand the role of the human kinome in response to DNA damage we targeted the non-essential kinome (some 350 kinases in total) using CRISPR-Cas9 and subsequently screened these deficient cells against a panel of DNA damaging agents (16 in total), many of which are commonly used chemotherapeutics. This approach led to the identification of four novel interactions between kinases, frequently misregulated in cancer, (EPHB6, GSK3B, STYK16 and STYK1) and DNA damaging agents, used as chemotherapeutics. Now we aim to further investigate these novel interactions in a panel of cell lines, including patient-derived cell lines. Next we shall elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which loss of these kinases renders cells sensitive to DNA damaging inducing chemotherapeutics. Finally, we propose to prioritise and confirm our findings in a murine xenograft model for one of the identified interactions. Work resulting from this proposal may lead to the better treatment of patients with cancer due to mutations in the kinases EPHB6, GSK3B, STYK16 and STYK1.

A detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing load-regulated bone remodeling could therefore lead to the identification of molecular targets for the development of novel therapies. Bone remodeling is a multiscale process mediated through complex interactions between multiple cell types and their local 3D environments. However, the underlying mechanisms of how cells respond to mechanical signals are still unclear. By combining single-cell âomicsâ technologies with well-established tissue-scale models of bone mechanobiology, MechAGE proposes to develop the technology required to allow spatially resolved in vivo single-cell mechanomics of bone adaptation and regeneration. CRISPR/Cas technology will be exploited to generate fluorescent reporter mice to identify the different cell types involved in the bone remodeling process. By combining RNA-sequencing of single cells isolated by laser-capture microdissection with micro-finite element analysis and time-lapsed in vivo micro-CT, MechAGE will link the transcriptome of hundreds of single cells to their local mechanical in vivo environment (LivE). This will allow investigation of molecular responses of the cells to LivE changes with aging in established mouse models of bone adaptation and regeneration. In addition to in vivo mechanomics, MechAGE proposes to use cellular and multiscale computational modeling to run in silico simulations of real-world events for better understanding of diseases of aging in mice and to maximize the use of the high quality in vivo mechanomic data. Findings from MechAGE will lead to a systems level understanding of the spatio-temporal regulation of gene expression during the process of load-induced bone adaptation and regeneration in the aging mouse.

First, chlorophyll is converted to a primary fluorescent chlorophyll catabolite (pFCC) with PHEOPHORBIDE A OXYGENASE (PAO) as the key enzyme. In the second part, pFCC is modified by different enzymes to ultimately produce a species-specific variety of final chlorophyll degradation products, so-called phyllobilins, which accumulate in the vacuole of senescent cells. Phyllobilins have been identified from more than twenty angiosperm species, mostly in senescent leaves. Accordingly, it has been considered that the PAO/phyllobilin pathway is highly conserved within higher plants. Even though almost all enzymatic steps of the first part of the PAO/phyllobilin pathway have been elucidated in the past, there are open questions regarding (i) the conservation of the pathway in different tissues within a given species, (ii) the degree of pathway diversity among different angiosperm species, including the molecular identity of several phyllobilin-modifying enzymes, and (iii) the evolutionary origin and phylogenetic distribution and diversity of the enzymes of the pathway. This proposal aims to address some of these aspects by answering the following questions:- How can tissue-specific differences in phyllobilin formation be explained?- How diverse is the occurrence of phyllobilins within photosynthetic organisms?- How widely distributed and how similar are the enzymes that catalyze PAO/phyllobilin pathway reactions?- What is the molecular identity of so far unknown activities within the pathway?To answer these questions, a variety of molecular, biochemical and analytical methods will be used. These include (i) analysis of enzyme activities, (ii) classical protein purification, (iii) production of transgenic plants by classical T-DNA- and CRISPR/Cas9-based methods and their analysis, (iv) phyllobilin analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, (v) genome-wide association studies and (vi) bioinformatics- and proteomics-based identification of candidate proteins.Breakdown of chlorophyll is a physiological process that has a broad impact for daily life; among other aspects it is relevant for the food industry, for example the shelf life of leafy vegetables and fruits, and for the amenity sector, for example turf grass systems. With this in mind, it seems surprising that the mechanism of chlorophyll breakdown so far mainly focused on a few angiosperm model species. This proposal aims to get a better picture about the extent of existence and variability of the PAO/phyllobilin pathway within the lineage of oxygenic photosynthetic organisms and about its evolutionary origin.

While hypothermia slows global protein synthesis and cell metabolism, a small subset of proteins, including the RNA-binding protein RBM3, escapes translational repression. We recently discovered that RBM3 protects cells from ER stress induced apoptosis by a molecular mechanism involving nuclear factor NF90 and the PERK-eIF2a-CHOP pathway. Preliminary data point towards a role of RBM3 in neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) self-renewal, interaction with insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF2) signaling, and that hypoxia ischemia (HI) suppresses RBM3 expression in vivo. Working hypotheses: 1) RBM3 plays a role in pluripotency, cell cycle progression, and lineage-specific differentiation of NSPCs.2) Integrity of the neurogenic niche and recovery after brain injury involves RBM3. 3) Therapeutic hypothermia after HI restores RBM3 expression and thus mediates neuroprotection. Specific aims, objectives: 1) to study the potential role of RBM3 in the regulation of NSPCs self-renewal, in HI vulnerability, and in IGF2 signaling in vitro2) to characterize the neurogenic niche in healthy and HI stressed RBM3 knock-out (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice with specific markers of ER stress response and IGF2 signaling3) to investigate RBM3 and RBM3 targets in therapeutic hypothermia after HI in vivoExperimental methods: In vitro model of NSPC self-renewal, lineage-specific differentiation; in vitro NSPC model for oxygen-glucose-deprivation (OGD), ER stress, and cold rescue. In vivo rescue model with intra-arterial transplantation of NSPCs after stroke. NSPCs are prepared from rodents, including RBM3 KO and WT mice. Rodent model of HI, including RBM3 KO and WT mice, with and without hypothermia treatment. Organotypic hippocampal slice culture. Basic research methods, including immunostaining, Western blot, Co-IP, proximity ligation assay, and real-time RT-PCR of RBM3, ER stress induced signaling, IGF2 signaling, apoptotic and neuronal markers; apoptosis and proliferation assays. siRNA and CRISPR/Cas9 system for target gene specific gene silencing, knock-in mice. Expected value of project: Enhancing the understanding of RBM3 signaling and elucidating the role of RBM3 in neural cell development and repair in vitro and in vivo will provide new insights in the molecular mechanisms underlying therapeutic hypothermia.

However, a large body of evidence infers the existence of a previous, more primitive biology in which RNA also stored information in cellular entities. Recreating a living cellular fossil representing this transition from an ancient RNA world to modern DNA-based life would fundamentally advance our understanding of our biologyâs history, and enable us to explore its biological properties experimentally. However, the reengineering of existing molecular systems into a viable doppelganger of the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) or one of its precursors is extremely challenging. I propose to use a novel, combined top-down and bottom-up approach to create a modern-day doppelganger of LUCA by engineering bacterial hybrids with core cellular functions encoded on RNA. Using Darwinian Evolution as driver, my team and I will prototype and refine synthetic RNA-replicons through alternating replication in both cell-free and intracellular environments. This âdual evolutionâ approach will shape increasingly complex RNA networks capable of encoding complex genetic information. Following this, we will use these networks to create information-rich RNA chromosomes, enabling the transfer of essential genomic information from DNA to RNA. Finally, we will address this intergenomic transplantation by combining a novel RNA-delivery strategy with iterative rounds of genome deletion and complementation using state-of-the art CRISPR-Cas9 assisted genome editing. The proposed research will fundamentally advance synthetic biology, and could positively answer the transformative questions: Can we create, program and evolve life-like systems that can survive in both cell-free and intracellular environments? Can we use these entities to construct an alternative biology in which central cellular activities are encoded on genomes not made of DNA?	European Research Council	Starting Grant	1500000.0EUR

We have previously found that reversion mutations BRCA1 or BRCA2 cause PARPi resistance. Others have shown that restoring DNA resection in BRCA1 mutant tumour cells, via 53BP1 or REV7 dysfunction, also causes PARPi resistance. In new unpublished data, we also show that mutations in PARP1 itself cause PARPi resistance by altering the ability of PARPi to âtrapâ PARP1 on DNA. This new data thus highlights how understanding the nature of trapped PARP1 could be key to understanding tumour cell and patient responses to PARPi in breast cancer. To understand this, we propose to study the composition of the trapped PARP nucleoprotein complex that is caused by the Pfizer PARP inhibitor talazoparib. To prosecute these studies, we will use a combination of standard and more novel biochemical approaches as well as in vitro genetic perturbation CRISPR-CAs9 approaches. We will use a multidisciplinary team to prosecute the work, with the contributions from those with expertise in functional genormic and PARP inhibitor biology (Lord) and the clinical assessment of novel therapeutic approaches in breast cancer including PART inhibitors (Tutt). In this proposal, we request funds to cover the salaries and running costs of two post-doctoral fellows and a contrinution towards bioinoformatic support to carry out the work. Identifying and understanding how novel approaches for treating breast cancer is critical to improving outcomes in the disease. We believe that observations and findings made in this work will (i) enhance the understanding of how tumour suppressor gene defects impart a series of genetic dependencies/vulnerabilities upon tumour cells; and (ii) inform how a molecularly-defined subset of breast cancer is best treated.

My 2018 publications in European Heart Journal and Circulation Research showed HCM could be phenocopied by a set of 11 isogenic CRISPR/Cas9 variants of the MYH7 gene (beta myosin heavy chain) of human pluripotent stem cell-cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs). Twelve different phenotyping methods were used to interrogate the generated human cell lines, often showing contradictory results relative to animal models. Importantly, a cohort of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) potentially linked to HCM was identified by RNA sequencing. This collection of cell resources, underpinning technologies and putative lncRNA pathway controllers form the basis of this proposal. Hypothesis and plans: I hypothesise that unveiling the function of these novel lncRNAs will provide new mechanisms and drug targets for HCM. To test this hypothesis, I propose to modulate the expression of these lncRNAs in hPSC-CMs by harnessing the dead Cas9 technology. I will then assess the phenotype of up/down-regulating these lncRNAs in the context of HCM, by employing the methodologies previously developed (molecular and functional assays). This will enable determining the role of lncRNAs in HCM - either as disease-causing or cardioprotective per se, or as gene modifiers regulating the primary disease effects caused by the structural defect. Finally, prediction and validation of lncRNA-interacting proteins by coupling in silico tools with molecular biology methods will result in the identification of new pathways involved in HCM, shedding light into the development of future drug treatments. If replacement of 50% of animals for HCM research could be achieved by further validating the human model, this will equate to sparing of 2100-5000 animals (of all species) in severe procedures in the next 10 years.

354	Dr Lee Lydia Sarah Hui	University College London	2018-08-01	2022-07-31	MICA: Optimising combination strategies for chimeric antigen receptor therapy in multiple myeloma	Rationale and Timeliness: Further molecular insight of the pathways involved in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is warranted for deeper understanding of the disease and drug development efforts. My 2018 publications in European Heart Journal and Circulation Research showed HCM could be phenocopied by a set of 11 isogenic CRISPR/Cas9 variants of the MYH7 gene (beta myosin heavy chain) of human pluripotent stem cell-cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs). Twelve different phenotyping methods were used to interrogate the generated human cell lines, often showing contradictory results relative to animal models. Importantly, a cohort of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) potentially linked to HCM was identified by RNA sequencing. This collection of cell resources, underpinning technologies and putative lncRNA pathway controllers form the basis of this proposal. Hypothesis and plans: I hypothesise that unveiling the function of these novel lncRNAs will provide new mechanisms and drug targets for HCM. To test this hypothesis, I propose to modulate the expression of these lncRNAs in hPSC-CMs by harnessing the dead Cas9 technology. I will then assess the phenotype of up/down-regulating these lncRNAs in the context of HCM, by employing the methodologies previously developed (molecular and functional assays). This will enable determining the role of lncRNAs in HCM - either as disease-causing or cardioprotective per se, or as gene modifiers regulating the primary disease effects caused by the structural defect. Finally, prediction and validation of lncRNA-interacting proteins by coupling in silico tools with molecular biology methods will result in the identification of new pathways involved in HCM, shedding light into the development of future drug treatments. If replacement of 50% of animals for HCM research could be achieved by further validating the human model, this will equate to sparing of 2100-5000 animals (of all species) in severe procedures in the next 10 years.

355	Dr Lee Lydia Sarah Hui	Department of Pediatrics University of California	2017-08-01	2019-01-31	Identification and validation of novel therapeutic targets for treatment of KRAS-dependent cancers	Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The most prevalent type of lung cancer is Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). A significant number of NSCLC cases are driven by activating mutations in Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS). However, the efforts to target KRAS directly have thus far proven unsuccessful and tumors harboring mutations in this gene remain the most difficult to treat, highlighting the need for alternative approaches. One promising avenue to treat these cancers is to exploit the concept of synthetic lethality. The aim of this project is to identify novel druggable KRAS synthetic lethal interactions. To achieve this goal we will perform genetic screens using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and the Cas9 nuclease (CRISPR/Cas9) system in KRAS-dependent lung cancer cell lines. We will also screen for combinations of KRAS interacting genes with already existing cancer drug targets. Finally, we will validate the identified genes and drug targets in vitro and in vivo, using human lung cancer cell lines, mouse models of lung cancer and patient-derived xenografts (PDX). This strategy should shorten the path towards the development of drugs for NSCLC and other KRAS-dependent cancers.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Advanced Postdoc.Mobility	809878.0GBP

Tumors bearing these mutations remain the most difficult to treat, as the efforts to target oncogenic KRAS for cancer therapy have so far proven unsuccessful. The goal of this project is to identify and validate novel druggable targets for the therapy of KRAS-dependent non-small cell lung cancer cancer (NSCLC). To achieve this goal we will perform genetic screens using an innovative version of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in KRAS-dependent lung cancer cell lines. We will also validate the identified genes and drug targets in vivo, using mouse models of KRAS cancers and patient derived xenografts. This should lead to the development of a novel therapeutic strategy to treat KRAS-driven cancers.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Early Postdoc.Mobility	809878.0GBP
357	Dr Lee Lydia Sarah Hui	Life Sciences Institute Division of Science Brandeis University	2017-01-01	2018-06-30	The molecular basis of cold- and hygro-sensing in Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae.	The understanding basic biological mechanisms, like for example the sensation of external stimuli are the foundation for medical relevant studies. In the last 100 years, Drosophila melanogaster has been established as a genetically accessible model organism and is used for basic research. The extensive molecular toolset available for the fruit fly combined with the conservation of many processes compared with other organisms, makes this organism suitable for studying many questions. In this comparative and interdisciplinary proposal, we will use the genetically accessible, well-studied model of Drosophila melanogaster to probe the molecular details of moisture/humidity sensing. This is of special importance, as basic understanding of the mechanism how cold or humidity is sensed on the cellular level is not described to date. The sensation of high temperature in Drosophila is mediated by different receptor molecules, among them members of a conserved family of receptors, the transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channels. These receptors were found to be thermo-receptors in many organisms from flies to humans {Patapoutian, 2005 #100}. Recently the Ionotropic Receptors IR25a and IR93a were identified as key mediators of cold and hygrosensation in the fruit fly by Prof Garritys lab. Interestingly, both of these receptors can produce multiple alternative receptor isoforms with potentially distinct functions. Furthermore, whether the receptor complexes participate in hygro- or cold sensing seems to depend on a third receptor. Detailed analysis of the different isoforms and receptor complexes will bring insights into basic molecular mechanisms of sensory cells and polymodality of these receptors. In further experiments, we will use of the newly established CRISPR/Cas9 system in mosquitos to analyze, whether basic mechanisms of cold and moisture sensing are conserved between species. The goal is to establish a molecular model of cold and moisture sensing in Drosophila and to transfer knowledge gained to Anopheles gambiae, a malaria-transmitting insect in the second part of the proposal. Identification and detailed description of receptors that are used for host seeking in this mosquito are potential targets for insect repellants or traps.

Organ shape is to a large extent determined by cell behaviour and cell behaviour is to a large extent regulated by cell-cell interaction and cell-matrix interaction, as well as by cell-cell signalling.A major interest of my laboratory over the last few years has been to determine how branching morphogenesis restructures epithelial or endothelial structures such as the insect tracheal or the vertebrate vasculature. We have used high resolution live imaging with different marker proteins to analyse cell behaviour in vivo during the branching process. We are now increasing our efforts to better understand the molecular control of the relevant cell behaviours. With the help of the recently introduced genome editing tool Crispr/Cas, the task to mutate candidate genes has become straightforward, and we have already generate several mutants and characterized their role in angiogenesis. Since many genes/proteins are actively rather broadly and are required for basic cell functions such as cellular trafficking, cell division, etc., we have started to develop protein-manipulation tools which eventually should allow us to manipulate proteins in a cell- and time-induced manner. These tools are based on protein binders and we have pioneered the use of the later in multicellular systems some time ago. We are developing such protein-binder tools for proteins of interest in order to use them for protein trapping, degradation, miss-localization, ect. These studies should allow a novel view on the role of many proteins in angiogenesis, and pave the way to a molecular understanding of the fascinating process of branching morphogenesis.In the next granting period, we would like to address the following questions:1)How are cell rearrangement controlled and coordinated during the different steps of angiogenesis?2)How is the lumen formed during sprouting and anastomosis3)How are cell rearrangements and lumen formation controlled at the molecular level?In order to answer these questions, we will take the following experimental strategies:1)We will analyse the role of several proteins involved in the regulation of Ve-cadherin in cell rearrangements.2)We will analyse the role of trafficking in cell rearrangement and lumen formation.3)We will develop novel protein binder tools to manipulate proteins possibly involved in the above processes in a cell- and time-specific manner.4)We will try to establish CLEM in order to look at high resolution into endothelial cell during the branching process.

359	Dr Lee Lydia Sarah Hui	University of Basel	2014-12-01	2017-11-30	In vivo cell biology of organ morphogenesis	Project: In vivo cell biology of organ morphogenesis1 .Summary of the research planOrgans and tissues acquire particular three-dimensional shapes during development, which are intimately linked to the particular function(s) an organ has to fulfil. Organ shape is to a large extent determined by cell behaviour, and cell behaviour is to a large extent regulated by cell-cell signalling and cell mechanics. A major interest of my laboratory over the last few years has been to determine how branching morphogenesis restructures epithelial tissues to generate such fascinating structures as the trachea or the vasculature. While we have initially put much effort in understanding this process in vivo in an invertebrate system (tracheal development in Drosophila melanogaster) using state of the art genetics in combination with high resolution live imaging, we have recently moved much of our research efforts to vertebrates, in particular to zebrafish (Danio rerio). Using high resolution in vivo imaging, we have described the cellular activities during angiogenesis, in particular during sprouting, vessel fusion and vessel pruning. To our surprise, we find that the plasticity of developing vessels is accompanied by unexpected cell behaviour; endothelial cells can fission and self-fuse during anastomosis and pruning, respectively. With the advent of the recently introduced genome manipulation tools (TALEN, CRISPR/Cas9), a genetic dissection of the different steps in angiogenesis is now possible at unprecedented level, and proteins can be tagged at endogenous loci and used as marker for high resolution live imaging. We have recently applied intracellular nanobodies for the first time in developing drosophila embryos to directly manipulate protein function, in particular for protein degradation. We used an anti-GFP nanobody fused to an F-box in degrade GFP-fusion proteins (we called the method âdeGradFPâ for degrading GFP). In the meantime, we have functionalized the anti-GFP nanobody manifold, so that it can be used for in vivo protein trapping, protein localisation and for post-translation modification of proteins of interest. During the next granting period, we will introduce the use of intracellular nanobodies (and other protein binders) for studying the zebrafish vascular system, in particular to answer the following questions:Q1: How is the dynamic cell behaviour during sprouting controlled?Q2: How do endothelial cells recognize each other in order to connect?Q3: Which molecular processes are involved in luminal membrane expansion?Q4: Which molecular processes are involved in membrane fusion and membrane fission?In order to answer these questions, we propose to undertake the following experimental strategies:1) Investigate the role of VE-cad in the dynamic rearrangements of endothelial cells.2) Generate and use cutting edge in vivo live imaging tools to characterize molecular aspects of cell behaviour during angiogenesis processes.3) Generate and analyse mutations in candidate genes affecting distinct cellular activities.4) Generate and use novel tools to manipulate protein function in vivo - a step closer to a synthetic biology approach to organ formation.

360	Dr Lee Lydia Sarah Hui	ETH Zurich - ETHZ	2018-01-09	2022-08-31	Identification of convergent molecular pathways in autism spectrum disorder by in utero genome editing and transcriptional profiling of cortical projection neuron subtypes	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a collection of phenotypically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders affecting 1/100 individuals worldwide, and recent patient sequencing based studies have revealed over 1000 risk alleles. Evidence is mounting that suggests the neurobiological basis of ASD is associated with projection neurons (PNs) of the mammalian neocortex during midfetal development. Although these advancements provide an entry point into studying the disorder, the molecular underpinnings of ASD as well as how the disparate risk alleles converge onto a common set of pathways leading to similar behavioral phenotypes are largely unknown. To identify the convergent pathways underlying ASD, we will genetically perturb ASD risk genes in utero and directly compare the resulting molecular, cellular, and morphological phenotypes in cortical PN subtypes. Building on our previous work on mouse models of ASD, transcriptional profiling, and in vivo and in utero genome editing, we will: Aim 1 - Develop CRISPR-Cas9 reagents to perturb high confidence ASD risk genes in utero. We will develop and validate CRISPR-Cas9 reagents targeting mouse orthologs of high confidence ASD (hcASD) risk genes CHD8, DYRK1A, ARID1B, and POGZ by in utero electroporation (IUE) and genome editing analysis in mice. Methods enabling the rapid modeling of loss-of-function (LOF) variants in ASD risk genes in vivo will facilitate the systematic interrogation of the underlying mechanism(s) of ASD.Aim 2 - Investigate gene-edited cortical progenitors and projection neurons in situ to reveal shared phenotypes. In mice harboring LOF variants in select hcASD risk genes, we will investigate cortical progenitor and PN phenotypes, such as progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation as well as PN composition and lamination, respectively. This approach will pinpoint relevant cell types and phenotypes shared upon perturbation of select hcASD risk genes.Aim 3 - Characterize gene-edited cortical projection neuron subtypes by transcriptional profiling to identify shared ASD pathways. From gene-edited mice, we will purify cortical PN subtypes harboring LOF variants in select hcASD risk genes and perform transcriptional profiling of each population at high resolution. An integrated analysis across genotypes will allow us to distinguish gene-specific effects from shared pathways, enabling the identification of critical cell types and the convergent pathways underlying perturbation of select hcASD risk genes.Aim 4 - Characterize gene-edited neurons by pooled in utero perturbation and single cell transcriptional profiling to identify convergent ASD pathways. Using pooled lentiviral CRISPR libraries, we will perturb 100 probable and high confidence ASD risk genes in utero, such that single cells receive single perturbation, and subsequently perform single cell transcriptional profiling. After linking ASD risk gene perturbations with single cell transcriptional profiles, we will perform an integrated analysis to characterize the cell states and convergent molecular pathways shared upon perturbation of 100 ASD risk genes.The proposed studies will establish an in utero methodology for rapidly perturbing and phenotypically investigating meaningful cell types harboring LOF variants in ASD risk genes in vivo, thereby overcoming current limitations in ASD research involved with animal model generation and cross-model comparisons. By investigating multiple ASD risk genes and cell types in parallel, under identical experimental conditions, we will elucidate critical features underlying the neurobiological mechanism(s) of ASD. The methodologies developed here will be a valuable resource to the field and can be extended to any gene or gene set of interest.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div.

361	Dr Lee Lydia Sarah Hui	Camargo Laboratory Children's Hospital Boston	2017-05-01	2018-10-31	The role of YAP in liver cancer	Hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocellular carcinoma are the most common neoplasms of the liver and a global health concern, with very limited systemic treatment options.The Hippo/YAP-signaling pathway is an important regulator of liver organ size, as well as liver cell fate, and has been implicated in development of liver cancer. While the core Hippo pathway has been studied extensively, little is known about the actual downstream target effectors of YAP, which promote transcriptional output, especially in the context of tumorigenesis.We hypothesize that YAP is transcriptionally regulating relevant oncogenic drivers downstream to induce and maintain cancer. We further assume that dysregulated YAP is one of the important drivers of tumor maintenance. The aim of this ongoing project is to screen for and evaluate biologically relevant target effectors downstream of YAP and to better understand the role of YAP in tumor maintenance in the context of liver cancer.In the last months, we established an in vivo screen using a mouse model with hepatocyte-specific overexpression of a constitutive active YAP protein by deleting selected YAP target genes with a library of genomically integrated sgRNAs using the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system. Biologically and therapeutically attractive hits of the screen will be genetically and pharmacologically validated.Furthermore, we want to study the effect of YAP knockout in the setting of established liver tumors. To this end we are introducing CRISPR-Cas9 mediated mutations in commonly alterated tumor suppressor genes, and once liver tumors have established, analyze them for YAP activation and the effect of cancer cell-specific YAP knockout on tumor growth and biology.This study will provide a first systematic description of YAP targets in the context of carcinogenesis, and these findings have the potential to identify important downstream effectors as cancer drug targets. Further, we are going to better understand the biology of YAP in already established tumors.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Advanced Postdoc.Mobility	700000.0CHF
362	Dr Lee Lydia Sarah Hui	University of Geneva	2016-03-01	2019-02-28	EvoDevo and Physics of Skin Colours	A few years ago, I obtained a SINERGIA grant together with Prof. Matthias Zwicker (Computer Science, Bern) and Dirk van der Marel (Condense Matter Physics, Geneva) with the ambition to initiate integration of biological, physical, and computer science approaches for a better understanding of skin colours and patterns of skin appendages and colour in amniotes. The skin appendages and pigmentation systems in vertebrates are promising model systems because species exhibit astonishing variations in skin appendage morphologies, as well as colour and colour patterns generated by pigments (black/brown, yellow and red) and structural elements (photonic crystals) incorporated into various types of chromatophores and iridophores, respectively. This variation is of great ecological importance as scales, feathers, hairs, and spines provide mechanical protection, and colours play critical roles in thermoregulation, photoprotection, camouflage, display, and reproductive isolation (hence, speciation). Our SINERGIA project was a success as we (a) Developed innovative robotics and computer graphics methods for automated phenotyping of skin surface (Martins, et al. 2015), (b) Used these developments for the analysis of scale patterns in crocodiles, a study that allowed us to uncover an entirely new developmental mechanism (Milinkovitch, et al. 2013), (c) Characterised unique multi-sensory micro-organs in the skin of crocodiles (Di-Poi and Milinkovitch 2013), (d) Characterised the development of skin appendages in the spiny mouse (Montandon, et al. 2014), (e) Characterised through histology, mass-spectrometry, photonic methods, and in-silico simulations the interactions between photonic nanostructures and pigmentary elements that generate extensive colour pattern variation in Phelsuma lizards (Saenko, et al. 2013), (f) Used mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data and Support-Vector-Machine (SVM) approaches to characterise the phylogeography of colour pattern variation in panther chameleons (Grbic, et al. 2015), (g) Combined biology and photonics to show that chameleons shift colour through active tuning of a lattice of guanine nanocrystals within a superficial thick layer of dermal iridophores (Teyssier, et al. 2015), (h) Characterised the physical parameters of surface-grating nano-structures (using electron and atomic-force microscopy) that are responsible for iridescence in snakes, and (i) used the knowledge acquired in point h to develop a new technique for computationally-effective and interactive simulation and rendering of diffraction effects produced by such biological nano-structures (Dhillon, et al. 2014). In addition, for linkage-mapping analyses, we have been continuously establishing, these last six years, families of corn snakes and lizards segregating mono-locus skin colour and colour pattern phenotypes.In the present multidisciplinary project, I propose to capitalise on our collaborations and combined expertise in computer science, physics and evolutionary developmental biology for the identification of the physical and biochemical self-organisation mechanisms underlying the formation of skin pigmentation and skin structural colours in squamate reptiles. This will require the development of biological and physical assays as well as new computer science methods, but the project will be greatly facilitated by the equipment, methodologies, and biological material, as well as the close multidisciplinary collaborations, that we have developed in the past. First, we will finalise the linkage mapping analysis of colour pattern mutations in snakes to identify the genes involved in these spectacular phenotypes. Second, we will produce ex-vivo culture of embryonic skin and tissue-disrupted in-vitro cell cultures from reptilian skin and we will treat these samples with pharmacological agents and CRISPR/Cas9 transgenesis to characterise the role of the identified (by linkage mapping) pathways in normal and mutant patterning. In parallel, we will improve and extend our 3D geometry and colour texture acquisition pipeline, perform quantitative analyses of phenotypes, characterise their variation, track changes during their development, and develop mathematical models to simulate pattern formation using Partial-Differential-Equations, Finite-Element and multi-resolution and Cell Automata Methods, all guided by our results on ex-vivo and in-vitro cultures. Third, we will perform hyperspectral imaging and advanced photonic crystallography (using scatterometry and near-field techniques) in chameleons, other lizards and snakes. These analyses will uncover the detailed physical and biological mechanisms explaining how squamate reptiles generate and manipulate structural colours, for example for changing colour during display as shown in our recent article on chameleons (Teyssier et al. 2015). The project is at the frontier between the physics of biology and evolutionary developmental biology. My multidisciplinary team of researchers (including physicists, computer scientists, developmental biologists, and evolutionary biologists), as well as the access to the laboratory equipment and competences in photonics of Prof. Dirk van der Marelâs team, will greatly facilitate our analyses of the evolution and ecological significance of signalling pathways and self-organisational phenomena involved in the determinism of adaptive skin colours and colour patterns.

Paediatric tumours have particularly benefited from advances in research in the last 30 years. However the treatment-associated long-term side effects induced by their lack of specificity to tumour cells and high dosage administration remain a challenging problem. As children are by definition long-term survivors, there is a strong need for the development of new, low-toxicity, better targeted and efficient therapeutic strategies for all types of childhood cancers. TAT-RasGAP317-326 is a cell-permeable peptide derived from the p120 RasGAP protein. This peptide does not modulate cell death by itself but, potently sensitizes adult tumour cells in vitro and in vivo to various anti-cancer treatments, including genotoxins and radiotherapy. Importantly, it displays specificity to cancer cells as it does not sensitize non-tumoral cells to genotoxin-induced apoptosis. TAT-RasGAP317-326 may therefore be of considerable benefit to children by increasing the efficacy of anti-cancer therapies, which could allow to lower their dosage and associated side-effects. Very encouraging in vitro preliminary results, obtained by screening various childhood cancer cell lines, indicate that pediatric tumours are sensitive to the sensitizing action of TAT-RasGAP317-326. As a consequence, we propose to undertake this project in collaboration with two laboratories. The first one is the Research in Pediatric Oncology Laboratory of CHUV directed by Dr Nicole Gross, who has extensive expertise in the biological and genetic mechanisms involved in the development of neuroblastoma, Ewingâs sarcoma and medulloblastoma. They have also developed in vivo orthotopic models for these types of tumours. The second one is the laboratory of Prof. Christian Widmann, who is highly experienced in the field of apoptosis and has developed the TAT-RasGAP317-326 peptide. This complementary expertise is a great advantage for both in vitro and in vivo experimentations. The aims of the present project are:â¢In vitro assessment of the response of childhood cancer cells to sensitization by TAT-RasGAP317-326; â¢Evaluation of the clinical potential of TAT-RasGAP317-326 by exploring its in vivo efficacy using well-characterized orthotopic and heterotopic nude mouse models;â¢Elucidation of the mode of action of TAT-RasGAP317-326 and more specifically its targets using both an unbiased immune-based pull-down approach and CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-Cas9) knockout technology.

364	Dr Lee Lydia Sarah Hui	University of Berne	2018-03-01	2022-02-28	Theileria effectors transforming host cells into cancer-like cells	Theileria is a genus of tick-borne parasites which are closely related to other apicomplexan parasites of medical importance such as Plasmodium, Cryptosporidium and Toxoplasma. The two most important species, Theileria annulata and Theileria parva cause tropical theileriosis and East Coast fever (ECF) in cattle, respectively. T. parva alone is estimated to account for the death of >1 Mio cattle each year in sub-Saharan Africa with a substantial socio-economic impact and loss of US$ >300 Mio. One of the hallmarks of disease is the proliferation and dissemination of infected host cells into various organs. After tick transmission of sporozoites, leukocytes get invaded, followed by the development of schizont-forming parasites, and host cells acquire properties otherwise only known from cancer cells such as resistance to apoptosis, uncontrolled proliferation and metastatic potential. Despite considerable research efforts to link phenotypic changes and perturbed host cell signaling pathways, TaPIN1 is the only characterized Theileria effector protein to date that has been shown to contribute to host cell transformation. This absence of knowledge can mainly be attributed to a lack of genetic tools and a Theileria genome of ~4000 genes, half of which have no predicted function. In contrast, an arsenal of effector proteins has been discovered over the past decade in the highly tractable Toxoplasma system that hijacks host signaling pathways and takes control over gene expression. We aim to identify and characterize the function of novel Theileria effector proteins and explore how they interfere with cell signaling pathways and gene regulation that promote host cell transformation. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of genomic-scale analysis, the power of CRISPR/Cas9-based reverse genetics, a high throughput pathway analysis panel, life cell imaging and mass spectrometry. The specific aims of this proposal are (1) Identification of Theileria effector proteins and associated host cell manipulation; (2) CRISPR-based knockout of identified effector proteins; (3) Characterization of the host-pathogen protein interaction network. The characterization of novel Theileria effectors will be a fundamental step forward for the understanding on how Theileria transforms cells and causes disease. This knowledge may lead to improved interventions designed to reverse host cell transformation, thereby improving immune control of Theileria infection. It may also add new insights into cell physiology and pathway alterations in cancerous cells.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Ambizione	895928.0CHF
365	Dr Lee Lydia Sarah Hui	University of Zurich	2017-07-01	2021-06-30	Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypic variability in ciliopathies	A central problem in human genetics is to understand the path leading from genetic variation to human disease and its variability. This proposal aims to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying the substantial phenotypic variability observed in Joubert syndrome (JBTS), a neurodevelopmental Mendelian disorder part of the ciliopathy spectrum. To achieve this goal, the first step of the proposed research plan combines two experimental models with complementary strengths, namely zebrafish mutants and CRISPR/Cas9 genome-edited human induced-pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons, to compare the molecular consequences of loss-of-function in 4 different JBTS genes. This will untangle the shared effects of their loss-of-function from their diverging gene-specific effects. Second, I will take advantage of the variety of cilia-types present in zebrafish, mirroring the situation in humans, to investigate tissue-specific functions for each of the 4 genes. Finally, by generating zebrafish mutants carrying mutations in more than one gene, I will determine the combined effect of these mutations on the phenotypic outcome to investigate genetic modifiers. The enhanced understanding of the molecular consequences of JBTS gene mutations resulting from this work will increase our predictive ability for individual patients and set the stage for development of specific therapies.

During development, liver progenitors collectively move to form an organ primordium, where they differentiate into polarized epithelial cells. How progenitors actively self-organize and which factors are required in those processes is poorly understood, but pre-requisite for efficient stem cell differentiation and tissue engineering. I propose to pioneer a live imaging protocol to study at single cell resolution, how liver progenitors assemble into an organ in zebrafish embryos, transitioning from migratory into polarized cells. To carefully track and segment cell shapes over time, I plan to generate a next-generation four-color labeling system to mark, in a mosaic fashion cell membranes and/or nuclei of any given tissue. By combining this system with spectrally compatible GFP lines, labeling neighboring tissues or polarized hepatic proteins, I will analyze which specific cellular behaviors and tissue-tissue interactions control the three-dimensional organization of liver architecture.Preliminary results indicate that ubiquitous or restricted localization of transmembrane protein EphrinB1 is essential for progenitor cell motility and differentiation into mature hepatocytes. To assess whether differential EphrinB1 localization is associated with different molecular functions, I plan to analyze its role at different stages of liver morphogenesis. For this, I will generate conditional EphrinB1 mutant alleles, using CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering, and identify signaling targets and interactors by transcriptome and proteome analyses of isolated liver cells.

367	Dr Lee Lydia Sarah Hui	University of Berne	2017-05-01	2021-04-30	Molecular mechanisms of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation	Background: The precise nature of anti-bacterial and anti-fungal inflammatory responses has not yet been completely defined. Besides intracellular killing, neutrophils are able to exert an antibacterial effect in the extracellular space by forming so-called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) containing released DNA and granule proteins. These represent an important antimicrobial function of neutrophils, as well as a phenomenon contributing to the perpetuation of inflammation. Despite its clear clinical relevance, little information is available regarding mechanisms underlying NET formation. There is an urgent need to dissect the molecular mechanism of NET formation, partly because of the intense debate about the origin of the released DNA in NETs and about a requirement for cell death for NET release, but more importantly because recent reports indicate the important role of mtDNA in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematous (SLE). Therefore, progress in finding drugs to minimize immunopathology in such autoimmune diseases depends on understanding these mechanisms.Hypothesis: Extracellular DNA trap formation is a programmed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) expulsion, which forms a DNA matrix associated with released granule proteins. The formation of NETs requires the active participation of molecules regulating mitochondrial dynamics and the cell cytoskeleton. We hypothesize that for NET formation cytoskeletal rearrangements such as actin polymerization and microtubule (MT) network formation are necessary for the directed transport of mitochondria and granules towards the plasma membrane. In addition, we have data indicating that mitochondrial dynamics, namely mitochondrial fusion, is essential for mtDNA release, underlining the active role of mitochondria during NET formation. Moreover, extracellular calcium influx is required for the formation of NETs, and we have identified a responsible calcium channel required for NET formation. Specific aims: We aim to better understand molecular mechanisms for mtDNA and granule protein release during extracellular DNA trap formation in neutrophils.AIM 1: Active participation of the cell cytoskeleton in NET formation will be studied using pharmacological and genetic approaches. Primary mouse neutrophils genetically deficient in actin polymerization, i.e. lacking the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) or Glutaredoxin 1 (Grx1) enzyme will be used to analyze the role of actin in NET formation. High-end microscopic techniques (3D-scanning electron microscopy) will be applied to envisage the details of DNA expulsion.AIM 2: Our shRNA-screening results have identified a mitochondrial fusion protein [optic atrophy-1 protein (Opa1)] as candidate gene directly responsible for MT network formation and mitochondrial mobilization leading to NET formation. Conditional knockout Opa1 (Opa1N?) mouse neutrophils as well as patientsâ neutrophils deficient in functional Opa1 [autosomal dominant optic atrophy disease (ADOA)] will be used to dissect the mechanism of mtDNA release. To study the direct role of MT, we will apply the novel approach of in vivo conditional / inducible CRISPR/Cas9 tubulin knockout mice to delete specific microtubule genes up-regulated in mature activated neutrophils in an inducible and conditional manner. AIM 3: We have obtained evidence that the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel is present in neutrophils and is required for NET formation. Using BK-/- neutrophils, we plan to dissect the function of extracellular calcium flux and its role in temporal activation events in NET formation.Wider scientific context: mtDNA is now recognized as a key immune regulator.

Changes in gene expression are the first immediate readout of genetic variants, and the dynamics, magnitude and variability of the changes are what leads to diversity in complex traits. Here we want to determine features (such as genomic distribution, effect size and location relative to the transcripts they influence) of genetic variants that affect dynamic gene expression after an environmental shift, and the mechanisms how they lead to differential dynamics. To this end we apply a combination of approaches: i) QTL mapping to identify genomic regions that enable faster adaptation to a new environment via differentially affecting transcript dynamics, ii) developing a computational framework for identifying molecular mechanisms that underlie these differential transcript dynamics and iii) exploit the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate single nucleotide exchanges for fine-mapping of causal alleles.

369	Dr Lee Lydia Sarah Hui	Genome Biology Unit European Molecular Biology Institute EMBL	2018-02-01	2019-07-31	Dissecting genetic interactions underlying complex traits via systematic genome editing	A major challenge for understanding phenotypic diversity and enabling precision medicine is improving our currently very limited ability to predict phenotypic outcomes based on genome sequence and environmental context. Our lack of knowledge on the functional consequences of the vast majority of genetic variation is one of the fundamental problems impeding such endeavors. While naturally occurring variants have the most relevance for explaining phenotypic diversity, systematic genome perturbations have primarily been focused on large-effect alleles, such as gene deletions. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping have addressed the role of natural variation in conditioning complex traits, but these approaches are limited by the haplotypes present in the population and are poorly equipped to detect interactions between loci - situations where the effect of one variant is masked or enhanced by another variant. It has become clear that a comprehensive view of genetic variation and its role in shaping phenotypes requires systematic perturbation of each variant in different genetic and environmental contexts. Recent advances in genome engineering now make such an approach possible. Here I propose to systematically engineer and phenotype naturally occurring single nucleotide variants and small insertion-deletion polymorphisms in three distinct Saccharomyces cerevisiae backgrounds. The strains will be constructed by a high-throughput CRISPR approach that allows creation of thousands of barcoded and sequence-verified variant strains simultaneously. I will profile strain pools in multiple environments, identifying those variants that modulate fitness in a given environment and genetic background by next-generation sequencing of genomically integrated DNA barcodes. To map pairwise and higher-order interactions I will then directly engineer variant combinations and assay their impact on cellular processes and fitness. The work in this proposal will be an important contribution towards understanding the phenotypic landscape governed by natural variants and their interaction with each other and the environment. Due to the conservation of fundamental cellular processes, the here identified principles underlying allelic interactions will allow valuable insights into the organizing principles of cellular systems. By enabling the interpretation of genetic variation in specific biological and environmental contexts these insights lay the foundation for efforts to predict the phenotype of a cell based on its genotype and environment alone.

Symmetrically divergent copy number variations of the 7q11.23 chromosomal region display symmetrically opposite phenotypes with regard to social facets of brain function. Hemizygous deletions cause WS, characterized by excessive friendliness, unreserved behavior around strangers, an engaging personality and striking verbal ability. Duplications of the region resemble autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with impaired social interactions and language deficits. Thus 7q11.23 represents the source of a cognitive axis that determines facets of human social behavior. Based on previous findings in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC derived neurons, we hypothesize that the WS deletion results in premature cell cycle exit and apoptosis of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) that lead to altered micro-circuitry as the brain develops. The basis for these disruptions has been attributed to haploinsufficiencies of BAZ1B, GTF2I or FZD9, three genes contained in the deleted region. We will seek additional evidence for developmental dysfunction related to these genes by RNAseq of cerebral organoids.(1) Generation and microscopic analysis of patient-derived cerebral organoids. We will generate iPSC derived brain organoids from WS patients, carriers of 7q11.23 duplication and control individuals. We will use clearing procedures (CLARITY) to define the developmental laminar organization by comparing cell content and thickness of ventricular zone and the outer subventricular zone. Relative abundances of cell types, numbers of apoptotic cells and the balance between proliferation and differentiation will be determined semiquantitatively by immunohistochemistry, pulse-chase experiments and FUCCI labeling to quantify phases of the cell cycle in the samples.(2) Single-cell RNAseq profiling of cerebral organoids. Drop-seq will be utilized to corroborate altered cell type abundances, and resolve transcriptional changes to the level of cell types in the developing brain. This will again test our hypothesis of incomplete differentiation, and reveal many novel transcripts relevant to WS and 7q11.23 duplication syndrome.As a future direction, we will determine the contribution of BAZ1B, GTF2I and FZD9 haploinsufficiencies to WS and 7q11.23 duplication syndrome. CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing will be used to generate heterozygous loss-of-function alleles for BAZ1B, GTF2I and FZD9 in control iPSCs. Cerebral organoids grown from these genetically engineered cells will be analyzed as described in (1) and (2) and the extent to which they recapitulate the WS neuro-phenotype will be determined. Together, the proposed experiments will provide a comprehensive picture of WS and 7q11.23 duplication syndrome that will link the known genetic defect to a cellular phenotype.

371	Dr Lee Lydia Sarah Hui	University of Lausanne	2016-12-01	2018-11-30	The Genomic Basis of Life History Adaptation	Life history traits are central to our understanding of adaptation because they represent direct targets of selection. However, while much progress has been made in uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying fitness-related traits, mainly by studying large-effect mutants in model organisms, little is known about naturally occurring genetic variants that affect these traits. The central aim of my current SNSF Professorship grant is to identify naturally occurring polymorphisms that underlie evolutionary changes in life history, using Drosophila melanogaster as a model. Over the last 33 months, we have used two complementary approaches to tackle this problem: to generate 'catalogs' of candidate variants we have applied whole-genome Pool-sequencing to (1) North American populations clinally differentiated for life history and (2) a >30-year-long artificial selection experiment for longevity. Both approaches are 'designed' to maximize among-population life-history differentiation and thus to increase our ability to map life-history variants via sequencing. In a second step, we have begun to perform experiments to examine the life-history effects of some of these candidate mechanisms. Based on our genomic analyses, we have prioritized three candidate mechanisms for experiments: (1) for the cline, we have identified clinal SNP polymorphisms in several genes involved in insulin signaling, a pathway known from molecular studies to regulate life-history physiology, including a clinal 2-SNP polymorphism in the transcription factor gene foxo; (2) a clinal chromosomal inversion polymorphism, In(3R)Payne, to which 79% of the most strongly clinal SNPs in the genome map; and (3), in the selection experiment, we have found strong enrichment of immunity genes among our top candidates. To date, our experiments show that (1) the foxo polymorphism has major pleiotropic on egg-to-adult survival, body size and starvation resistance, in assays based on synthetic recombinant inbred lines; (2) the In(3R)Payne polymorphism is maintained by clinal selection, independent of neutrality and admixture, and affects body size, a strongly clinal trait; and (3) the long-lived selection lines survive pathogenic infections much better than the controls. In this application for a 2-year extension of my grant, we propose to follow up on these promising leads. First, to better understand how the foxo polymorphism affects life history, we will use homologous replacement of the 2 SNPs (and their allelic combinations) into a common background via CRISPR/Cas9, in collaboration with Alistair McGregor (Oxford); we will measure additive and epistatic effects of these constructs on life history and FOXO activity. Second, to identify targets of selection within In(3R)Payne, we will phase-sequence isochromosomal lines and apply ABC-based coalescent models to the data, in collaboration with Mark Kirkpatrick (Austin). In addition, we will perform RNA-seq of standard vs. inverted lines to uncover transcriptional differences between inversion karyotypes. Finally, to begin to uncover the regulatory details of the intriguing but poorly understood connection between lifespan and immunity in the longevity selection lines, we will assay transcriptional responses to infection in selection versus control lines, both in young and old flies, and - secondly - test whether silencing immune genes via transgenic RNAi affects lifespan, as hypothesized. Together, this integrative approach - spanning population genomics, functional genetics, and physiology - will significantly advance our understanding of the molecular basis of adaptive changes in life history and aging, a fundamental but largely unresolved problem in evolutionary biology.

The system inserts short DNA sequences, called spacers, derived from foreign nucleic acid molecules in between direct repeats, thus forming the CRISPR array. The transcribed spacers eventually serve as molecular guides for Cas proteins that monitor and destroy nucleic acids having sequences similar to those spacers. Thorough mapping of the functional components and regulators of the system in a single model organism will be extremely valuable for understanding its mechanism of action. Studying the interactions between bacteria and phages should highlight the evolutionary role of the system and its consequences for shaping ecological systems. These insights will lead to novel ways of exploiting the system to improve molecular biology tools, to protect fermenting bacteria from phage spoilage, to equip phages with anti-CRISPR warfare to fight bacteria, and to prevent horizontal gene transfer between pathogens. Here, I intend to systematically seek out new roles of the system and to identify fundamental mechanisms and components that allow the system to function efficiently. I will address fundamental questions such as how the system avoids sampling self DNA into the CRISPR array. In addition, I will pursue two revolutionary possibilities. One, that the CRISPR/Cas system is not merely an adaptive defense system against phages, but that one of its roles is to serve as molecular machinery for silencing specific harmful genes by generating small silencing RNAs without the need for Cas proteins. The other is to test the system's ability to prevent horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance genes in an effort to study the system's ecological value, potentially for applicative uses. My proposed studies will allow deeper understanding of the system, and enable breakthroughs from both basic and applicative aspects of the CRISPR field studies.

The proposed research is motivated by our interest in the roles of protein-RNA interactions in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic antiviral pathways and will proceed in two directions. The first project stems from our current work on the CRISPR pathway, a recently discovered RNA-guided adaptive defense mechanism in bacteria and archaea that silences mobile genetic elements such as viruses (bacteriophages) and plasmids. CRISPR systems rely on short RNAs (crRNAs) that associate with CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins and function as sequence-specific guides in the detection and destruction of invading nucleic acids. To obtain molecular insights into the mechanisms of crRNA-guided interference, we will pursue structural and functional studies of DNA-targeting ribonuceoprotein complexes from type II and III CRISPR systems. Our work will shed light on the function of these systems in microbial pathogenesis and provide a framework for the informed engineering of RNA-guided gene targeting technologies. The second proposed research direction centres on RNA-targeting antiviral strategies employed by the human innate immune system. Here, our work will focus on structural studies of major interferon-induced effector proteins, examining the allosteric activation mechanism of RNase L and the mechanism of the IFIT protein complex that specifically targets 5'-termini of viral RNAs. In our investigations, we plan to approach these questions using an integrated strategy combining structural biology, biochemistry and biophysics with cell-based functional studies. Together, our studies will provide fundamental molecular insights into RNA-centred antiviral mechanisms and their impact on human health and disease.

Characterization of the molecular mechanisms regulating CSC function is crucial to develop CSC-targeted therapies. Yet, due to the difficulty of isolating pure CSC populations and manipulating them ex vivo, our understanding of their biological properties is still limited. We have recently overcome these limitations by developing a method for the generation of human cells with functional hallmarks of CSCs through oncogenic reprogramming of somatic cells in vitro. Being controlled and amenable to experimental manipulation, this system represents a unique tool to study CSC biology. We will use in vitro-generated CSCs to perform CRISPR/Cas-based loss-of-function screens, with the aim of discovering novel mechanisms important for CSC formation and function. This study has the potential to identify novel biomarkers and new molecular targets for cancer therapies. Aims and Methods 1. Generation of a fluorescent CSC reporter. In order to monitor the phenotype of tumorigenic CSCs in living, unstained cells, we will generate a dual-color CSC fluorescent reporter, taking advantage of genes which are strongly up- or down-regulated in in vitro-generated CSCs and correlate with tumorigenic potential. 2. Primary screening. CSCs or partially-reprogrammed precursor cell lines expressing the fluorescent reporters will be used in two distinct CRISPR/Cas loss-of-function screens using available pooled gRNA libraries. In the first screen we will use the partially reprogrammed cells and screen for gRNAs which promote CSC appearance, to identify tumor suppressors. In the second screen, we will use the CSCs and screen for gRNAs which inhibit their tumorigenicity, to discover novel therapeutic targets. 3. Hit validation. To rule out off-target effects, primary hits will be validated using distinct gRNAs, and by performing rescue experiments. As a final readâout, in vivo xenograft assays will be used to assess cell tumor-initiating ability. How the results of this research will be used Based on preliminary results, we expect to identify numerous proteins affecting CSC formation and function. Priority for validation in clinically-derived CSCs will be assigned based on various criteria: correlation between gene expression profiles and clinical outcome using publicly available datasets, existence of reported mutations, single cell analysis on tumor sections, target druggability and availability of tool compounds. Follow-up drug screening will be performed using the same experimental system and read-outs. The prognostic value of the identified hits will also be analyzed.

Recent evidence shows that resident macrophages can originate from embryonic progenitors and be maintained in tissues long term by local proliferation independently of monocytes. This self-renewal ability, however, appears to decline with age, with potentially major consequences for the response to infection, the resolution of inflammation and the ability for tissue regeneration. Understanding the decline of self-renewal in the aging macrophage may thus hold key elements for maintaining healthy tissue integrity. Drawing from analogies to stem cell self-renewal we want to decipher the molecular and cellular parameters of macrophage self-renewal and its decline with age. We want to understand the age-associated changes in gene expression and epigenetic identity of tissue macrophage populations with the ultimate goal to reverse age dependent decline in self-renewal and function. Results from my laboratory have identified transcription factors that control the access to a network of self-renewal genes that are also used in stem cells. Using several complementary genetic mouse models tapping into this network we want to investigate whether its activation in resident macrophage population in vivo can rejuvenate their self-renewal capacity and revert aging related changes. These approaches will be complemented by unbiased genome wide screens in vivo using latest generation CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology to identify new signaling pathways guiding macrophage self-renewal and aging. Using innovate combinations of genetics and adoptive transfer protocols we will test whether this knowledge can be employed to reverse macrophage dependent loss of immune competence and failed tissue regeneration with age. Our results will lead to new general insight and potential novel cellular therapies for degenerative diseases.	European Research Council	Advanced Grant	2499994.0EUR

However, the mechanisms underlying EV-mediated RNA transfer are unknown, and reproducible methods for efficient loading of EVs with therapeutic RNA are lacking. The aim of my proposal is to (1) elucidate the mechanisms underlying EV internalization and processing that lead to the functional delivery of their RNA content and (2) radically improve the loading efficiency of EVs for therapeutic RNA delivery.

The outcome of this research will fundamentally advance our understanding of the cellular processes enabling EV-mediated RNA transfer, which is of crucial importance for the development of EV-based and EV-inspired delivery systems.

It is becoming increasingly clear that CRISPR-Cas (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; CRISPR associated) systems function beyond adaptive immunity. Preliminary data show that CRISPR-Cas deletion from Pseudomonas aeruginosa reduces both in vitro fitness and in vivo virulence. These phenotypes are caused by Csy1, a Cas protein thought to be involved in sequence-specific binding of the 5'-handle of crRNA. We hypothesise that Csy1 regulates expression of genes carrying sequen ce motifs similar to the 5'-handle. We will test this hypothesis by (1) transcriptome analysis of WT and Csy1 deletion mutants, (2) RIP-seq analysis of RNA co-purifying with Csy1 and (3) EMSA to measure sequence specificity of Csy1-RNA interactions. This project will reveal whether Csy1 of the P. aeruginosa CRISPR-Cas system is involved in a gene regulation function and will identify specific RNA motifs targeted by Csy1. If successful, the data from this seed project will serve as a basis for a full grant proposal aimed at (1) validating the Csy1-motif interactions in vivo (2) generalising Csy1-mediated gene regulation across P. aeruginosa strains and (3) testing the impact of Csy1 on P. aeruginosa virulence in other, more relevant, infection models, such as cell culture and thermally injured mouse infection models.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are pre-leukaemic disorders that reflect an early-stage malignancy with the potential to progress to acute leukaemia. We have previously demonstrated that MPN-derived tumour cells exhibit perturbations in DNA replication that lead to DNA damage.

To survive in this hostile environment microbes have evolved an adaptive immune system called CRISPR-Cas. The immune system is based on incorporation of invader DNA sequences in a memory locus (CRISPR), the formation of guide RNAs from this locus, and the degradation of invading target DNA using CRISPR RNA-guided protein complexes. Invaders escape immunity by making point mutations in the targeted region of their DNA, but hosts quickly restore immunity by integrating new memory sequences against the same invader in a process called priming. Recently, I have made the remarkable discovery that hosts mount a primed immune response even when facing heavily mutated invaders. This implies that the memory of the CRISPR-Cas system not only functions in the short term against relatively recent threats, but also remembers a range of revisiting old foes in the long term, providing a huge evolutionary benefit for the host in the arms race with their invaders. This proposal sets out to determine the mechanism of the enigmatic process of primed memory formation against heavily mutated invaders. Using a combination of genetic, biochemical and structural approaches, including state-of-the-art single molecule imaging of CRISPR immunity in living Escherichia coli cells, I will investigate the driving hypothesis that perfectly matching and degenerate targets are differentially recognized, and trigger either target DNA degradation or priming. Moreover, I will test the supposition that degenerate priming is a universal phenomenon among different CRISPR-Cas types. If this is the case, degenerate priming will impair the use of viruses as therapeutic agents to treat antibiotic resistant bacterial infections. To prevent CRISPR resistance I propose to screen for organic molecules that inhibit the formation of CRISPR resistance. These molecules can be co-administered with viruses to potentiate treatments.

384	Dr Moosajee Mariya	University College London	2018-05-29	2021-05-28	Generating in vitro human optic vesicles to dissect the genetic modifiers affecting ocular maldevelopment	Ocular maldevelopment is responsible for more than one-third of blindness and severe visual impairment in children worldwide. It encompasses whole eyeball abnormalities e.g. microphthalmia [abnormal small eye], anophthalmia [complete absence of the eye] and ocular coloboma [cleft of the eye], collectively known as MAC. It is the most common cause of childhood sight impairment certification in England and Wales, accounting for 18.4%. The UK incidence of MAC is 10.4 per 100,000 live births, with only 2% considered related to environmental factors e.g. maternally vitamin A deficiency and teratogenic exposure. There are approximately 90 genes known to cause non-syndromic and syndromic MAC, accounting for only 6% of genetic diagnoses. SOX2 and OTX2 are responsible for 60% of the severe bilateral cases of anophthalmia and microphthalmia. Little is known about the dysfunction of these key genes acting between 4-7 weeks gestation, as access to human ocular tissue is near impossible at this critical stage of early eye development. As a result there have been no comprehensive human studies investigating normal and abnormal ocular development as no suitable model exists. Most work is undertaken on animal models but these are suboptimal for several reasons: (i) the eye develops differently, for example the zebrafish optic and lens vesicles are solid structures that cavitate, unlike the human equivalent which are hollow, (ii) some genes fail to generate a comparable phenotype when disrupted due to potential redundancy, or (ii) cause embryonic lethality if knocked out preventing further study. Of the families with a positive genetic diagnosis there is significant inter-familial phenotypic variability e.g. some affected members display a unilateral anophthalmia, others a bilateral microphthalmia and some unaffected family members harbour the mutation but with non-penetrance. This proposal aims to discover and understand the role of genetic modifiers in ocular maldevelopment. We will replace the use of zebrafish and mouse models and optimise the use of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology to derive human in vitro 3D optic vesicles. We will dissect the molecular pathways disrupted by an OTX2 mutation (c.97+1delG intron 3) in a three-generation family displaying extremes of phenotypic variability. We will use CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to correct the mutation in one patientâs iPSC to observe reversal of the phenotype in the human model to determine whether the mutation is unequivocally causative or not. Comparative analysis of the transcriptome in optic vesicles will provide information on the gene expression profiles and help to identify potential predisposing/protective genetic modifiers that could be exploited to develop a therapy and immediately inform genetic counselling for families. Identifying genetic modifiers will allow us to investigate the interplay between genotype, gene expression and phenotype in early human eye development and provide useful genetic tools for future human organoid cultures. It will demonstrate the efficacy of an in vitro system to study gene function. Mouse, zebrafish and xenopus geneticists and developmental biologists will be encouraged to use organoid cultures as replacement for in vivo studies for a more accurate representation of human eye development.

Despite recent progress, adaptation is to date a poorly understood process largely due to limitations of current approaches that focus (i) on a priori candidate genes, (ii) on signals of selection at the DNA level without functional validation of the identified candidates, and (iii) on small sets of adaptive mutations that do not represent the variability present in natural populations. As a result, major questions such as what is the relative importance of different types of mutations in adaptation?, and what is the importance of epigenetic changes in adaptive evolution?, remain largely unanswered. To gain a deep understanding of adaptation, we need to systematically identify adaptive mutations across space and time, pinpoint their molecular mechanisms and discover their fitness effects. To this end, Drosophila melanogaster has proven to be an ideal organism. Besides the battery of genetic tools and resources available, D. melanogaster has recently adapted to live in out of Africa environments. We and others have already shown that transposable elements (TEs) have substantially contributed to the adaptation of D. melanogaster to different environmental challenges. Here, we propose to use state-of-the-art techniques, such as Illumina TruSeq sequencing and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, to systematically identify and characterize in detail adaptive TE insertions in D. melanogaster natural populations. Only by moving from gathering anecdotic evidence to applying global approaches, we will be able to start constructing a quantitative and predictive theory of adaptation that will be relevant for other species as well.

ABPA is a progressive lung disease caused by the mayor fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. Although the disease is not usually fatal, the economic costs are >Â£10 billion in the UK per year. ABPA affects people with a defective airway epithelial function such as asthmatics. However, the percentage of patients developing ABPA is <2.5%. Genetic factors for the development of disease have not been defined so far. The Manchester Fungal Infection Group, has performed a whole exome sequencing project to investigate genetic variants in ABPA patients that might play a crucial role for the development of this disease. Some of these variants are involved in avoiding A.fumigatus to grow in the respiratory airways. However, functional validation of these at risk factors is need. Transgenic animal models have been used to study genetic predisposing factors in infectious diseases. However, non-animal models will contribute significantly for the replacement of animals in biological research. A cell culture model to study the pathology of ABPA using cells carrying the specific mutations discovered in our genetics project will improve our understanding of this disease and will supply enough information to select genes for the development of new diagnostic test. This training fellowship will define whether in vitro and ex vivo models can contribute to this aim by: (i) Recreating specific gene variants associated to ABPA in monocyte and bronchial epithelial cells by CRISPR/Cas9 system and testing their role in Aspergillus persistence and allergic response. (ii) Studying the interaction between epithelial cells and macrophages to define which cell subset and genetic risk factor orchestrates the ABPA-response.(iii) Validating candidate genetic variants in primary cells from patients with known genetic background.

I have recently optimised ex vivo pancreatic organoids as an efficient and tractable system to study the effect of perturbations on ductal cell fate. I now propose to use organoids to characterise the cell types coexisting in the ductal compartment that are permissive or non-permissive for changing cell fate change, and the molecular pathways involved. Differentiation will be induced by Ngn3/Pdx1/MafA overexpression or by medium containing differentiation inducing factors. My goals are as follows: 1) Use transcriptomics to delineate different cell types in ductal INS-GFP organoids to identify markers of reprogramming-competent cells; 2) Compare RNASeq profiles of reprogrammed, intermediate, and unchanged organoid cells to reveal genes required for cell fate change; and 3) Perform a Crispr/Cas9-based loss of function screen to identify the crucial signaling pathways involved in duct cell fate maintenance, using CK19-Cherry as a marker of ductal cell fate. These results will elucidate the fundamental biology of pancreatic ductal cell plasticity and provide clues for how to unlock the regenerative capacity of pancreatic ductal cells in vivo for future therapies.

391	Dr Przewloka Marcin	University of Southampton	2018-12-01	2020-12-01	Novel Role of a Protein Phosphatase in Chromosome Segregation	Kinases and their antagonistic phosphatases both provide a key regulatory mechanism controlling many cellular events. Yet our molecular understanding of phosphatases lags behind. Recently we described an interaction between Protein Phosphatase 4 (PP4) and Drosophila centromeres, which when disrupted affects the mitotic centromere integrity and spindle assembly checkpoint activity. The details of this pathway remain to be elucidated. Nor is it known how this finding relates to PP4's de-regulation in many cancers. I will therefore turn to human cell line model to address these questions. Towards determining human PP4âs mitotic functions, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing will be used to generate cell lines expressing endogenous PP4 fused with the AID tag allowing for inducible and rapid degradation of the phosphatase. This approach will facilitate PP4 removal specifically in mitotic cells, the effects of which will be characterised by cell imaging. Parallel studies, including proteomics, will deliver precise information on the human PP4 interaction network and behaviour during mitosis. Together these data will reveal the affected processes and provide a "blueprint" for subsequent detailed investigations that identify the involved pathways, PP4-specific substrates and their phospho-regulatory sites. The results of this study will be later placed within a larger investigatory framework dissecting chromosome segregation.	Wellcome Trust	Seed Award in Science	100000.0GBP

Hypoxia (low oxygen) is found in >50% of breast tumours, and is more frequently found in the more aggressive triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype which is associated with worse patient survival. Hypoxia drives TNBC progression, promoting adaptation through genes regulating the major hallmarks of cancer. Clinically, hypoxia is associated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance and worse patient survival. Identifying ways to target hypoxic tumours is a key objective to improve therapeutic response. Hypoxia drives molecular adaptation through the HIF1Î± and HIF2Î± transcription factors. Attempts to target HIF directly have had limited success, however we showed that JQ1 an inhibitor of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins (BRD2-4 and BRDT), which are histone acetylation âreadersâ, reduced the expression of 44% of hypoxia-induced genes in TNBC, and reduced tumour growth in vivo . Aims We aim to understand which BET proteins regulate hypoxic molecular adaptation. We propose that targeting an individual BET protein will yield greater anti-hypoxic tumour effects. We will examine the requirement for individual BET proteins for survival and growth in the hypoxic microenvironment in vitro and in vivo . Finally we will analyse genome wide BET protein DNA binding and histone acetylation in hypoxia. Techniques and Methodology This project will use biochemical studies and CRISPR CAS9 genome editing and ChIP-Seq to determine which BET proteins are essential for HIF-mediated hypoxic adaptation, interrogating mechanistic aspects of hypoxic gene expression, growth and survival in hypoxia. We will evaluate the impact of an individual BET protein knockdown in a xenograft model using in vivo imaging. Impact on breast cancer research This work will provide a greater comprehension of hypoxic TNBC gene expression regulation and proof of concept data to accelerate the development of BET inhibitors as new leads for TNBC.

393	Dr McIntyre Alan	University of Zurich	2016-04-01	2019-03-31	SignalÃ¼bertragung wÃ¤hrend der Vulva-Entwicklung von Caenorhabditis elegans	Background:Research on vulval development has provided fundamental insights into the molecular and cellular processes controlling organogenesis. Thanks to its relative simplicity, the C. elegans vulva has become a paradigm to study the mechanisms of cell fate specification, proliferation and morphogenesis during development. During vulval fate specification, the combined action of the EGFR/RAS/MAPK, WNT and NOTCH signaling pathways induces three vulval precursor cells (VPCs) to adopt an invariant pattern of cell fates. Then, the three induced VPCs begin to proliferate and generate 22 terminally differentiated vulval cells. At the same time, vulval morphogenesis begins. The vulval cell invaginate to generate a lumen and extend circumferential extensions to form seven ring-shaped toroids that build a tubular organ.Preliminary results:We have conducted several forward genetic and RNA interference screens to identify genes regulating vulval induction and morphogenesis. Our data indicate that the proper positioning of the vulva in the mid-body region requires the polarized secretion of the inductive EGF signal from the anchor cell (AC), in addition to the basolateral localization of the EGFR in the VPCs. A systematic screen identified the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) SRA-9 and SRH-27 as well as the neurpopetide-like protein NLP-26 as regulators of polarized EGF secretion. In parallel,we have characterized genes that control different aspects of vulval morphogenesis. In particular, the invading AC induces the lateral constriction of the invaginating 1Â° vuF cells during lumen morphogenesis via the TOCA proteins. Finally, we have studied the control of VPC proliferation by the lin-39 hox and the lin-31 forkhead transcription factors. We found that LIN-39 HOX determines the temporal competence of the vulval cells undergo proliferation by activating the transcription of several cell cycle regulator genes.Specific aims:The proposed research focuses on three specific aims that each address an essential aspects of vulval development:How is the polarized secretion of LIN-3 EGF by the AC controlled?Which molecular pathways does the invading AC activate in the 1Â° vulF cells to induce their lateral constriction?How do LIN-31 Forkhead and LIN-39 HOX regulate the onset and termination of vulval cell proliferation?Proposed experiments:For aim 1, we will study the genetic and biochemical interactions between LIN-3 and the the newly identified regulators of LIN-3 secretion, the GPCRs SRA-9, SRH-247 and the neuropeptide-like gene NLP-2. We will test if polarized LIN-3 secretion occurs in other tissues known to use this pathway. For aim 2, we will investigate genes identified in our vulval morphogenesis screen that are required for lumen formation. Specifically, we will investigate the role of the TOCA proteins in sensing the invading AC and identify their downstream targets that regulate actomyosin activity. For aim 3, we will characterize the LIN-31 targets that control VPC proliferation and test the role of LIN-39 in maintaining vulval cell proliferation using conditional gene inactivation. Our experimental design for each of the three specific aims takes full advantage of different CRISPR/CAS9 genome editing techniques.Significance and impact of our research:Our combined approach to investigate vulval fate specification, cell proliferation and morphogenesis has the goal to yield a complete understanding of this model for organogenesis. The principles we are discovering in this relatively simple model are likely to apply also to the development of more complex organs. The polarized secretion of an inductive signal is important to select single cells from an equivalence group and position the developing organ in the body. Vulval lumen formation serves as a good model to study how invasive cells change the morphology of their target tissue, for example during tumor cell intravasation. Finally, our work on cell cycle control by lin-39 and lin-31 will uncover the mechanisms that determine the temporal competence of cells to proliferate and generate the appropriate number of terminally differentiated cells.

394	Dr McIntyre Alan	EPF Lausanne	2016-01-01	2018-12-31	A Recombinant Inbred Line Aedes aegypti Reference Panel to study the genetic basis of variation in vectorial capacity	Dengue and chikungunya are mosquito-borne arboviruses that cause diseases considered âneglectedâ by the Neglected Tropical Diseases panel from the World Health Organization. They affect millions of people, mostly in the developing world, resulting in substantial hospitalization and often death. Dengue is the most prevalent and rapidly spreading one, with an estimated 390 million human infections worldwide per year (Bhatt et al., 2013). It represents not only a severe public health problem, but also an economic burden for governments and individuals, with costs around US$2,1 billion per year only in the Americas (Shepard et al., 2011). Since 2004, chikungunya re-emerged at an unprecedented global scale, leaving its endemic areas in Africa and Asia towards naive regions in the Americas and even in Europe. Due to the lack of vaccines, prevention of dengue and chikungunya is based mainly in the control of their insect vector, the mosquito Aedes aegypti.Over the last decades, studies on A. aegypti vectorial competence and its capacity for pathogen transmission have generated important knowledge on dengue epidemiology. However, vector competence is not necessarily the most influential parameter underlying epidemiology dynamics. As the arboviruses also affect mosquito fitness, the mechanisms influencing vector competence are more likely the consequence of other phenotype adaptation's such as olfaction and gustatory cues, circadian rhythms and host seeking behavior, mating, and insecticide resistance. Therefore, a deeper understanding of A. aegypti biology and the impact of arbovirus infection on the life-history traits of this insect should have important implications for predicting the evolution of mosquito-parasite relationships and their role in the emergence and maintenance of arboviruses.It has proven up to date extremely challenging to achieve effective and sustainable control of A. aegypti populations to hinder arbovirus outbreaks. Historically, insecticides have been used with this aim. Nowadays insecticides are adopted with caution as genetic variation in natural populations leads to strong resistance selection against the few compounds that are allowed. New control alternatives are currently under development, such as the release in nature of mosquitoes that are genetically modified or infected with the bacteria Wolbachia, which in both cases aims to make the mosquitoes pathogen-resistant. But besides the potential ecological consequences, these strategies donât take into account the viral strain present at the locality of release, ignoring genome-by-genome (GxG) interactions between mosquito and its parasite, which has been shown to strongly influence transmission dynamics in several systems.To overcome these limitations, we propose here the generation and sequencing of a genetic reference panel for the mosquito A. aegypti for molecular and organismal genome-wide association studies. This panel will be an innovative genetics tool available as a resource to the mosquito scientific community, serving as a reference to the identification of genotype-phenotype relationships. This will complement classical efforts in the fight against the diseases transmitted by this vector, therefore contributing to a holistic understanding of the biology of A. aegypti as a whole. The integration of Rio de JaneiroÂ´s host lab expertise in different A. aegpyti wild strains, the Swiss lab competence on genetic reference panels and systems genetics, the availability of a mosquito reference genome and the use of increasingly cheaper massively parallel sequencing technology, makes the sequencing of the planned 100 A. aegpyti lines, in our opinion, a feasible task from both an experimental and economical point of view.Specifically, we propose here (i) the generation of a panel of at least 100 recombinant inbred lines of A. aegypti, (ii) the detailed genomic characterization of this panel and (iii) the use of genome-wide association mapping techniques to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with different organismal trait phenotypes (e.g. vectorial capacity). We expect that this community resource will allow researchers to search for candidate genetic variants that are relevant to arbovirus transmission dynamics, as well as for other traits related to mosquito biology. This resource will not only be valuable for quantitative genetics studies, but also for deep understanding of the Brazilian A. aegypti demography, inference of selective sweeps, and field work (Evans et al., 2015).Considering the natural genetic variability of mosquito populations collected in Brazil, advanced inter-crosses are currently being performed using samples representing four distinct groups. A derived strain containing the genetic pool of those parental populations will be divided in 250 lines, which will be successively inbred until they reach isogenicity. After 20 inbreeding generations, assuming that some lines will not be homozygously viable, we expect to characterize the genome of at least 100 lines and describe genetic variants present in this panel. Intermediate milestones, i.e, the sequencing of the four parental lines and the partial sequencing of some lines obtained in intermediate generations of the inbreeding stage, will allow the anticipation of the variability pool expected in the full panel and the control for the isogenicity status.Finally, we will conduct phenotypic studies in each line to identify genetic determinants that may affect components related to vector capacity. Genome-wide association studies for overall vector competence and QTL mapping studies for molecular phenotypes will elucidate novel molecular mechanisms that are involved in the dynamics of disease transmission. The generation of A. aegypti recombinant inbred lines will thereby serve as permanent resource for studying various components of the molecular transmission route. Our proposed resource is complementary to the recent implementation of genetic tools in this species such as RNAi, transgenesis and CRISPR-mediated knockouts, and will provide the scientific community an additional powerful instrument in the study of this species. Moreover, we expect that our trait mapping studies will identify novel genetic markers that could be harvested in new strategies that may be effective against dengue and chikungunya.

Triterpenoids form a large class of specialized plant metabolites. The functions of plant steroidal triterpenoids (phytosterols and brassinosteroids) are now well described. By contrast, the biological roles of non-steroidal triterpenoids such as Ã-amyrin, lupeol and brassicales-specific thalianol and marneral are mostly unknown. Besides their possible involvement in plant defense, recent studies suggest that several groups of non-steroidal triterpenoids may also serve as signaling molecules modulating plant growth and development. However, how structurally diverse non-steroidal triterpenoids are biosynthesized and further exert hormonal functions in vivo remain a quandary. Here, I propose to interrogate this question by studying three brassicales-specific cytochrome P450 families, CYP702A, 705A and 708A, which are speculated to modify non-steroidal triterpene skeletons into signaling compounds. Until now, genetic analysis of these CYP families has been impeded by the redundant nature of these gene families as well as the prevalent clustering of genes belonging to the same CYP family at adjacent genomic loci. To circumvent these difficulties, I intend to generate multiple Arabidopsis thaliana mutant lines of each CYP family using two complementary approaches, artificial microRNA silencing and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology, both of which are capable of down-regulating multiple genes simultaneously. I will then characterize the metabolic phenotypes of these mutant lines using state-of-the-art metabolomics. The structure of the relevant triterpenoids identified through this approach will be further elucidated. The proposed research will yield fundamental knowledge on triterpenoid metabolism in plants, and will further generate tractable genetic systems to understand the signaling properties of specialized non-steroidal triterpenes in plants.

Recently, in humans, some lncRNAs have been implicated in aberrant brain development and age-related mental illness, making them an interesting class of RNAs to study to identify new targets to cure such pathologies at a new level. The easily manipulating and fast growing nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been chosen as a model system to study lncRNAs in neuronal development and function. With genetic (creating new mutants with the CRISPR/Cas9 technique), biochemical (ribosome profiling on purified neurons and pull downs of protein partners with modified lncRNAs) and functional (phenotypic and behavioral assays) studies, I am willing to characterize the mechanisms of action of such a class of RNAs. Although the primary sequences of lncRNAs are not highly conserved between species, the hope is to be able to identify evolutionally conserved strategies and/or pathways lncRNAs act in and, therefore, alternative approaches to cure neuronal diseases.

397	Dr McIntyre Alan	University of Basel	2017-05-01	2021-04-30	Deciphering the role of lymphoid-tissue networks and innate lymphoid cells for adaptive immunity	Background: Different cells of the innate and adaptive immune system cooperate to achieve an equilibrium of immune responses that maintains tolerance to self-antigens (Ags), nutrients and commensal bacteria, but clears foreign Ags and eliminates tumor cells. T lymphocytes and their innate counterparts, the innate lymphoid cell (ILCs) are tightly regulated by a coordinate program of transcription factors. Moreover, tissue microenvironments contribute to the outcome of local immune responses such that immunopathology is avoided. Group 3 ILC3s are abundant in Ag entry sites like intestine, secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) and are also found in postnatally developing tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs). They act as first-line responders to tissue injury, infection and inflammation. Small intestinal (SI) ILC3s prevent T cell responses to commensal Ags, whereas splenic (SP) ILC3s promote T cell responses to foreign Ags emphasizing their tissue-specific properties. How SP and SI ILC subsets and T cells collaborate during inflammation and infection is not understood. A detailed analysis of SP and SI ILC subsets under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions will help to understand the mutual interaction of lymphoid tissues, ILC3s and T cells that are required for immune homeostasis in tissues. Here we propose a system-wide approach to investigate transcriptional landscapes of SP and SI-specific ILC3 subsets in mice under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions and in mice with disturbed T cell compartments. In particular, we seek to identify transcripts in ILC3s, which are tissue-specific or depend on interactions with CD4+ T cells. Moreover, we want to identify key pathways in ILC3s, which regulate their immune-regulatory function for CD4+ T cells. Finally, we want to elucidate how TLOs modulate adaptive immune responses. Working hypothesis: This research project is based on the hypothesis that the collaboration of ILC3 subsets with CD4+ T cells differentially regulates innate inflammation and adaptive immune responses in a tissue-dependent manner.Specific Aims: Here we propose a novel project aimed at (1) dissecting the molecular signatures of ILC3s, (2) characterizing the mutual interactions of ILC3s and CD4+ T cells and their impact for innate and adaptive immunity in vivo and (3) generating an inducible IL-7 tg mouse to test the effect of TLOs on ILC3s and adaptive immune cells.Experimental Design and Methods: Advances in single cell analysis, gene targeting and generation of inducible mouse models together with state of the art bioinformatics will be used to address the specific aims. We will map ILC3 signature in SP and SI of normal and CD4+ T cell deficient mice and in mouse model with acute intestinal or splenic inflammation. The function of tissue-specific ILC3 genes will be tested in loss of function models using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated deletion in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and by generating ROR?Cre-lox recombination mouse models. Using various Ags we will test the capacity of ILC3 subsets to regulate T cell responses in vivo and in vitro. Finally will study whether the induction of TLOs by ILC3s has an impact on adaptive immune cell homeostasis. Expected Value of the proposed project: Data obtained from this study will help to identify target genes and pathways that control the induction or suppression of T cell responses. These targets are laying the foundation for the development of new therapeutic strategies to prevent chronic inflammation and immune stimulation and to promote protective immune responses against pathogens as well as tolerance against commensal bacteria.

It is mostly concerned with the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying long-range and coordinated transcriptional control of clustered Hox genes. The ultimate aim of this research is to understand the origin, evolution and implementation of collinear Hox gene regulation in several developmental contexts such as the major axis, the appendicular axis and the external genitals. Several approaches are used relying on mammalian embryos and molecular genetics and generally based on the large amount of mutant stocks we have accumulated during the last rounds of SNF funding. This allelic series is now being complemented with CRISPR-cas9-based modifications in vivo. We would like to assess the respective weights of cluster internal versus external factors in these critical regulations by using range of deletions and inversions affecting the flanking gene deserts, as well as more surgical deletions of precise enhancer sequences present within the flanking TADs. In the case of the limbs, we want to directly visualize the implementation of this mechanism by 3D-DNA FISH. In addition, we will continue investigating the use of organoids (gastruloids) as a non-animal model system to try to study this molecular processes in more amenable conditions.

CRISPR array encodes for small interfering RNA molecules (called crRNAs), so that a match between crRNA and invading virus sequence provides immunity to infection. While there has been a significant progress in CRISPR/Cas research, it is still unclear how processes such as CRISPR transcript processing, prevention of autoimmunity, and the system induction upon virus infection are controlled. In particular, it is becoming increasingly clear that small RNAs that are encoded outside of CRISPR array have major regulatory roles in CRISPR/Cas, but a systematic identification and characterization of these CRISPR/Cas associated small RNAs has yet to be done. However, a major problem in comprehensive analysis of these small RNAs is insufficient accuracy with which transcription start sites (TSS) can be predicted. Another prominent problem for CRISPR/Cas systems is regulation of its induction, i.e. how a large number of crRNAs can be rapidly generated without leading to autoimmunity.Main goal of this proposal is to better understand control of CRISPR/Cas by small RNAs and during system induction; to achieve this goal, we will also extend our previous work on accurate alignments of bacterial promoter elements, and on biophysical modeling of transcription initiation by bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP), in order to significantly improve accuracy of TSS prediction. Specifically we will: i) Develop a novel - biophysically based - method for TSS detection in bacteria, which builds on our recent work on modeling how RNAP opens the two DNA strands and on accurately characterizing DNA sequences that interact with RNAP; the method will be based on explicitly estimating the rate of transcription initiation for any sequence of interest, ii) Systematically predict small RNAs that are related with CRISPR/Cas, analyze their conservation in bacterial genomes, and compare them with other elements of CRISPR/Cas systems, iii) Model regulation of CRISPR/Cas induction in E. coli, in order to understand how they achieve a rapid enough response to external signal. We expect that this research will significantly improve our understanding of CRISPR/Cas systems, and further improve bioinformatic methods which are necessary for analyzing bacterial genome sequences.

403	Dr Hall Nikki	University of Geneva	2016-07-01	2019-06-30	Monogenic diabetes: Integrating genetic screening with functional clinical biology	BACKGROUND: Monogenic diabetes represents a heterogeneous group of disorders resulting from defects in single genes. Defects are categorized primarily into three groups: developmental defects with a reduced number of beta cells, disruption of beta cell function or a progressive destruction of beta cells, mostly by defects in key regulators of autoimmunity. With the support of the SNF (Interdisciplinary grant CR33I3_140655) we have built a Swiss and international cohort of over 400 diabetic subjects, who are all genetically characterized (targeted next generation sequences, whole exome in selected cases). The approach by next generation sequencing yielded a high diagnostic rate of monogenic diabetes (MD) in 28% of the subjects, where we identi-fied known mutations and novel variants in the so called MODY genes (HNF4A, GCK, HNF1A, PDX1, HNF1B, NEUROD1, KLF11, CEL, PAX4, INS, BLK, ABCC8, KCNJ11). Confirming our ini-tial hypothesis that mutations in all genes controlling pancreas development and beta cell function could cause MD, we identified variants in additional 23% of the subjects of our cohort in 88 different genes (including KIAA2022). Based on these encouraging results we now propose the following hy-pothesis and related aims:PROJECT RATIONALE: In addition to the previous rational, we now extend our hypothesis to regulatory elements in noncod-ing regions contribute to the complex human diabetes phenotype in our cohort. We therefore propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: To investigate the unidentified families with a high probability of MD by whole genome sequencing, assess allele specific expression (ASE) and search for modifiers by RNA-Sequencing in the whole cohort. We will follow up on our cohort built with the previous grant and use cutting edge human genetics such as whole genome sequencing and RNA-Sequencing to investigate the complex mechanisms of diabetes. Aim 2: To functionally analyze newly identified genes involved in MD in vitro and in vivo by gen-erating a knockout mouse using the CRISPR-Cas9 technique.EXPECTED VALUE: We believe that our hypothesis is most efficiently tested with an interdisci-plinary approach, combining clinical endocrinology, human genetics and cell biology. Our results will help improve our understanding of the genetics and pathophysiology of underlying diabetes. If successful, we will not only extend the list of genes and noncoding regions causing MD but also provide insight into the physiology in human beta cell function. These results may help to identify novel targets to efficiently treat MD to prevent long-term complications in affected children. Moreover, the mechanistic insight may also serve to expand the therapeutic approaches to polygenic forms of diabetes. As proof of principle the results collected during the last funding period have led to critical adjustments of treatment for those participants who were initially misdiagnosed, improving their quality of life and hopefully prevention of long-term complications.

In humans, severe and fatal respiratory diseases have been observed through the emergence of zoonotic CoVs, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. CoVs are well known to efficiently evade early innate immune responses and enzymatic functions within - and virus-host interactions at - the CoV replication/transcription complex (RTC) are key to efficiently evade early innate immune responses. Working hypothesis and aims: We hypothesize that induction of early innate immune responses to CoV heavily rely on the ability of host cell innate immune sensors to access and recognize viral RNA and that CoVs have evolved efficacious mechanisms to prevent early detection of viral RNA. We further hypothesize that these early virus-host interactions predominantly take place at the CoV RTC. In order to mechanistically understand these innate immune evasion strategies, we will âilluminateâ the cellular environment of the CoV RTC to identify host cell factors that are required for CoV replication, and host cell factors that are targeting the CoV RTC to restrict CoV replication. The reverse genetic systems for the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and well characterized recombinant mutant viruses will be used in combination with murine and human models of infection to dissect key steps and key molecules involved in early innate immune responses on the molecular level. We will furthermore employ state-of-the-art technologies involving biotin ligase-mediated proximity labeling and proteomics, CRISPR/Cas9-based functional screens, and transcriptomics in combination with ribosomal profiling to obtain a detailed mechanistic view on (i) key interactions involved in early innate immune responses, (ii) the kinetics of these interactions and (iii) the kinetics of the global host cell response under well-defined conditions. These studies will provide spatial and temporal view of basic principles of viral RNA recognition and antiviral innate immune mechanisms in different primary cell types following virus infection. Expected significance: Our proposed studies will reveal basic principles of viral RNA sensing and antiviral innate immune effector mechanisms that are highly relevant also beyond CoV infections. We expect to identify key molecules, mechanisms and pathways that promote or restrict viral replication at the site of viral RNA synthesis. This information will further our understanding on fundamental aspects of viral RNA synthesis and innate immune responses to RNA virus infection, and will facilitate the development of novel strategies to interfere with viral RNA replication during the early phase of infections.

Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignancy in women, with an incidence of one in eight being affected within their lifetime. This emphasizes the need to improve breast cancer prevention and treatment. Breast carcinomas are divided into several clinical subtypes. Among these is invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), which is characterized by neoplastic mammary cells invading the surrounding stroma in a dispersed, discohesive growth pattern. This phenotype is based on dysfunctional cell-cell adhesion, primarily driven by lack of E-cadherin (CDH1) protein expression. Consequently, most ILCs display loss-of-function alterations of the CDH1 locus. Although several recurrent genetic alterations have been identified in human ILC, only a few of these genes have been functionally studied in mice in the context of Cdh1 loss. Hence, more systematic approaches are required to functionally and comprehensively decipher the molecular processes of ILC initiation and metastatic progression.Prof. Jonkersâ laboratory at the Netherlands Cancer Institute - Antoni van Leeuwenhoek hospital (NKI- AVL), has demonstrated considerable expertise in modeling breast cancer using 3D organotypic cultures and diverse genetically engineered mouse models. Moreover, a recently introduced culture method has enabled 2D in vitro propagation of primary murine mammary epithelial cells (MMECs). To this end, MMEC cultures derived from wild-type or Cdh1-floxed mice will serve as platform to conduct CRISPR/Cas9-based, genome-wide screening approaches. Candidate genes promoting MMEC proliferation in conjunction with Cdh1 loss will be further evaluated in a rapid, non-germline CRISPR/Cas9-dependent mouse model of ILC. Of note, the MMEC culture system will also be instrumental to expand and functionally study human primary cells derived from ILCs and corresponding precursor-type lesions. This will complement the data arising from murine ILC-modeling, thus ultimately unraveling novel drivers of human ILC. Taken together, these findings will deepen the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of ILC and may have substantial translational impact on breast cancer prognosis and therapy.

410	Dr. ATANASOVA Lea	University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna	2018-03-01	2023-04-30	NEW GMC OXIDOREDUCTASES FROM CLONOSTACHYS ROSEA	Enzymes from the glucose-methanol-choline family of flavin-dependent enzymes (GMC oxidoreductases) are often linked to enzymatic combustion, a mechanism of ligninolysis involving several non-specific oxidative enzymes. Such mechanisms have mostly been described in basidiomycetous brown rot and white rot fungi, but are largely unknown in non-ligninolytic Ascomycota. Clonostachys rosea (Hypocreales, Ascomycota) is a filamentous with a broad range of ecological specializations from plant associations, saprotrophy to biotrophy and parasitism on nematodes and other fungi. Upon sequencing of C. rosea genomes, the gene family encoding GMC oxidoreductases classified as auxiliary activity family 3 (CAZy classification), specifically subfamily AA3_2 (aryl alcohol and glucose oxidases), was found to be significantly expanded. On the other hand, the genomes of the saprotrophs Neurospora crassa and Trichoderma reesei as well as the mycoparasites Trichoderma atroviride and Trichoderma virens (ecologically very similar to C. rosea) showed a significantly reduced AA3 gene content, suggesting that such enzymes are not essential for these nutritional strategies, and were either not acquired or lost by selective adaptation. This poses the question about the function of this many C. rosea paralogs, as this fungus is neither a prominent lignocellulose decomposer nor a plant pathogen, that would demand such an arsenal of genes for (ligno)cellulose degradation. The aim of this study is to elucidate the functionality and role of C. rosea GMC oxidoreductases, and identify the nutritional strategies they are involved in. Our research plan includes a transcriptional study of GMC oxidoreductases that are significantly regulated under the C. rosea major nutritional conditions, an investigation of the functional significance of GMC oxidoreductases in C. rosea (including single/multiple inactivation of genes using state-of-the-art CRISPR/Cas9 engineering tools) and biochemical characterization of selected GMC oxidoreductases that encode functional enzymes. Our large-scale approach will provide important insights in the regulation of gene families supporting different life-styles in C. rosea and highlight complex mechanisms of mycoparasitism and fungus-plant interactions.

Identification of new driver pathways is critical to develop credible personalised treatments. PTEN suppresses the oncogenic PI3K pathway and regulates homologous recombination (HR) and consequently its loss can be targeted by inhibitors of the PI3K and DNA repair pathways. I have recently identified that PTEN loss or downregulation is common in HGSOC (present in 281 of 447 cases), occurs mainly by copy number alterations (CNA), is associated with worse prognosis and offers possibilities for personalized therapy. My hypothesis is that the effects of PTEN activity in HGSOC are dose-dependent and expression levels and cellular localization of PTEN determine functional differences. I aim to 1) model the functional effects of PTEN haploinsufficiency or loss in tumour cell lines; 2) test small molecule inhibitors from Astrazeneca in combinations targeting PI3K pathway and HR. In aim 1, I will analyse gene expression/pathways, HR, cellular localization of proteins and drug response in CRISPR transformed HGSOC lines. For aim 2, I will develop an ex-vivo model using tumour sections from primary tumours to validate potential therapeutic combinations from aim 1 in patient material. The translational impact of this work will be to use PTEN expression/dosage as a validated biomarker for routine clinical stratification in clinical trials targeting the PTEN pathway in HGSOC. I will also develop a model to predict therapeutic response and to validate new drug combinations in pre-clinical trials.	Cancer Research UK	CCC - Post Doctoral Research Bursary	402091.54EUR

Furthermore, how the cell types are maintained by stem cells throughout adulthood has important biomedical implications. Different from humans who age when their stem cells are depleted due to an imbalance between self-renewal and differentiation, simpler organisms, like cnidarians, continuously generate new cells from stem cells without any signs of senescence. However, the possible connection between cell type complexity, its evolution, and the non-senescent properties of stem cells in these organisms remain to be elucidated. In this project, we will identify and investigate the hitherto enigmatic stem cells and the full cell type diversity in a virtually immortal animal, the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. To this end, we will combine microfluidics-based single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), for unbiased molecular characterization of cell populations, with gene perturbation studies for assessing the functional roles of putative stem-cell marker genes. As a complementary approach, we will investigate the role of known genes commonly associated with the germline and pleuripotent stem cells. The identified candidate stem cells will be monitored by lineage tracing in transgenic animals to visualize their differentiation potential. We will test the function of the identified stem cell genes by gene knockdowns and in CRISPR/Cas9 mutants. The morphant embryos will be subjected to scRNA-seq to identify cell populations that are affected and hence, likely to be direct progenies of the stem cells. The molecular profiling will provide an objective and comprehensive basis for assessing the relationship between genetic and organismal complexity. Revealing the identity and molecular features of stem cells in this immortal animal will be key for our understanding of regenerative capacity and longevity.

Their efficient synthesis has remained a major challenge and the current limited access to these compounds severely impedes progress in modern research areas of RNA biology. The envisaged synthetic pathways also aim at increasing the structural diversity of cRNAs; this will be achieved by modifications concerning the phosphate backbone through formation of alternative internucleotide linkages (e.g. 2'-5'-, 5'-5'(3'-3')-phosphodiesters, phosphorothioates, triazoles linkages, amide linkages) and by insertion of distinct ribose modifications (e.g. 2'-OCH3, -F, -H, 2'-Oâ4'-C methylene (LNA monomers), 2'-tethers bearing reactive groups such as alkyne, vinyl, or amino groups).

However, a large body of evidence infers the existence of a previous, more primitive biology in which RNA also stored information in cellular entities. Recreating a living cellular fossil representing this transition from an ancient RNA world to modern DNA-based life would fundamentally advance our understanding of our biologyâs history, and enable us to explore its biological properties experimentally. However, the reengineering of existing molecular systems into a viable doppelganger of the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) or one of its precursors is extremely challenging. I propose to use a novel, combined top-down and bottom-up approach to create a modern-day doppelganger of LUCA by engineering bacterial hybrids with core cellular functions encoded on RNA. Using Darwinian Evolution as driver, my team and I will prototype and refine synthetic RNA-replicons through alternating replication in both cell-free and intracellular environments. This âdual evolutionâ approach will shape increasingly complex RNA networks capable of encoding complex genetic information. Following this, we will use these networks to create information-rich RNA chromosomes, enabling the transfer of essential genomic information from DNA to RNA. Finally, we will address this intergenomic transplantation by combining a novel RNA-delivery strategy with iterative rounds of genome deletion and complementation using state-of-the art CRISPR-Cas9 assisted genome editing. The proposed research will fundamentally advance synthetic biology, and could positively answer the transformative questions: Can we create, program and evolve life-like systems that can survive in both cell-free and intracellular environments? Can we use these entities to construct an alternative biology in which central cellular activities are encoded on genomes not made of DNA?	European Research Council	Starting Grant	1500000.0EUR
416	Professor Lord Christopher	Institute of Cancer Research	2018-04-01	2021-03-31	Exploiting the PARP1 trapping qualities of talazoaprib to optimise the treatment of breast	Although PARP inhibitors (PARPi) such as the Pfizer drug talazoparib are able to elicit profound and sustained therapeutic responses in breast cancer, drug resistance is an issue. We have previously found that reversion mutations BRCA1 or BRCA2 cause PARPi resistance. Others have shown that restoring DNA resection in BRCA1 mutant tumour cells, via 53BP1 or REV7 dysfunction, also causes PARPi resistance. In new unpublished data, we also show that mutations in PARP1 itself cause PARPi resistance by altering the ability of PARPi to âtrapâ PARP1 on DNA. This new data thus highlights how understanding the nature of trapped PARP1 could be key to understanding tumour cell and patient responses to PARPi in breast cancer. To understand this, we propose to study the composition of the trapped PARP nucleoprotein complex that is caused by the Pfizer PARP inhibitor talazoparib. To prosecute these studies, we will use a combination of standard and more novel biochemical approaches as well as in vitro genetic perturbation CRISPR-CAs9 approaches. We will use a multidisciplinary team to prosecute the work, with the contributions from those with expertise in functional genormic and PARP inhibitor biology (Lord) and the clinical assessment of novel therapeutic approaches in breast cancer including PART inhibitors (Tutt). In this proposal, we request funds to cover the salaries and running costs of two post-doctoral fellows and a contrinution towards bioinoformatic support to carry out the work. Identifying and understanding how novel approaches for treating breast cancer is critical to improving outcomes in the disease. We believe that observations and findings made in this work will (i) enhance the understanding of how tumour suppressor gene defects impart a series of genetic dependencies/vulnerabilities upon tumour cells; and (ii) inform how a molecularly-defined subset of breast cancer is best treated.

My 2018 publications in European Heart Journal and Circulation Research showed HCM could be phenocopied by a set of 11 isogenic CRISPR/Cas9 variants of the MYH7 gene (beta myosin heavy chain) of human pluripotent stem cell-cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs). Twelve different phenotyping methods were used to interrogate the generated human cell lines, often showing contradictory results relative to animal models.

Evidence is mounting that suggests the neurobiological basis of ASD is associated with projection neurons (PNs) of the mammalian neocortex during midfetal development. Although these advancements provide an entry point into studying the disorder, the molecular underpinnings of ASD as well as how the disparate risk alleles converge onto a common set of pathways leading to similar behavioral phenotypes are largely unknown. To identify the convergent pathways underlying ASD, we will genetically perturb ASD risk genes in utero and directly compare the resulting molecular, cellular, and morphological phenotypes in cortical PN subtypes. Building on our previous work on mouse models of ASD, transcriptional profiling, and in vivo and in utero genome editing, we will: Aim 1 - Develop CRISPR-Cas9 reagents to perturb high confidence ASD risk genes in utero. We will develop and validate CRISPR-Cas9 reagents targeting mouse orthologs of high confidence ASD (hcASD) risk genes CHD8, DYRK1A, ARID1B, and POGZ by in utero electroporation (IUE) and genome editing analysis in mice. Methods enabling the rapid modeling of loss-of-function (LOF) variants in ASD risk genes in vivo will facilitate the systematic interrogation of the underlying mechanism(s) of ASD.Aim 2 - Investigate gene-edited cortical progenitors and projection neurons in situ to reveal shared phenotypes. In mice harboring LOF variants in select hcASD risk genes, we will investigate cortical progenitor and PN phenotypes, such as progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation as well as PN composition and lamination, respectively. This approach will pinpoint relevant cell types and phenotypes shared upon perturbation of select hcASD risk genes.Aim 3 - Characterize gene-edited cortical projection neuron subtypes by transcriptional profiling to identify shared ASD pathways. From gene-edited mice, we will purify cortical PN subtypes harboring LOF variants in select hcASD risk genes and perform transcriptional profiling of each population at high resolution. An integrated analysis across genotypes will allow us to distinguish gene-specific effects from shared pathways, enabling the identification of critical cell types and the convergent pathways underlying perturbation of select hcASD risk genes.Aim 4 - Characterize gene-edited neurons by pooled in utero perturbation and single cell transcriptional profiling to identify convergent ASD pathways. Using pooled lentiviral CRISPR libraries, we will perturb 100 probable and high confidence ASD risk genes in utero, such that single cells receive single perturbation, and subsequently perform single cell transcriptional profiling. After linking ASD risk gene perturbations with single cell transcriptional profiles, we will perform an integrated analysis to characterize the cell states and convergent molecular pathways shared upon perturbation of 100 ASD risk genes.The proposed studies will establish an in utero methodology for rapidly perturbing and phenotypically investigating meaningful cell types harboring LOF variants in ASD risk genes in vivo, thereby overcoming current limitations in ASD research involved with animal model generation and cross-model comparisons. By investigating multiple ASD risk genes and cell types in parallel, under identical experimental conditions, we will elucidate critical features underlying the neurobiological mechanism(s) of ASD. The methodologies developed here will be a valuable resource to the field and can be extended to any gene or gene set of interest.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div.

Multiple studies have demonstrated that iPSCs carrying patient-specific mutations can recapitulate functional and cellular phenotypes observed in patients. In addition to modeling of the pathogenesis and functional deficits in rare diseases, advances in iPSC technology have potentially broad applications in drug discovery, toxicity testing, and developing novel drug screening platforms. Genomic editing to correct disease-causing mutations is a promising approach for the treatment of human diseases. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system has substantially improved the ability to make precise changes in the human genome. Combining iPSC technology with CRISPR system has provided the ability to repair mutated causative alleles in patient lines, or to introduce disease alleles into a healthy âWTâ cell line. This has enabled analysis of isogenic cell pairs that differ in a single genetic change, which allows a precise assessment of the molecular and cellular phenotypes underlying this abnormality under the same genetic background. These isogenic cell lines can be used not only to understand the cellular consequences of disease mutations, but also to perform high throughput drug screens to both understand the underlying pathological mechanisms and to develop novel therapeutic agents to prevent or treat diseases. In this work, we plan to combine iPSC and genome editing technology for understanding molecular disease mechanisms of rare hereditary neuromuscular diseases. We will use patient-derived iPSCs to model neurological hereditary diseases. Using the latest CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we will introduce precise modifications into the genome of our patient-derived iPSCs and we need to produce the transfer viral vectors to modulate the expression of target gene in neuronal cell. Following genome editing, we will differentiate both unmodified and modified iPSC lines into disease-relevant cell types, such as cortical and motor neurons to study the underlying disease pathways. My visit will mainly involve an extensive training on the preparation of viral based gene transfer systems for research and therapy applications in neuromuscular diseases. Azzouzâs lab has extensive experience and track record in neurodegeneration research and collaborating with his group would be a great opportunity for us to develop our research plans. We expect that the collaboration would make a significant contribution to our research background. In particular, their broad experience in the generation of viral vectors to modulate the expression of target gene in neuronal cells, and studying DNA instability in patient derived neurons. This would help us to better understanding of the underlying disease phenotypes and to establish new therapeutic strategies and developing new drug screening platforms.

Summary of the research planA central mechanism of immune response is antigen recognition. The dogma that only peptides stimulate T cells has become obsolete after the evidence that structurally different molecules, including lipids and small metabolites, are immunogenic for T cells. Ongoing studies are revealing the relevance of non-peptide-specific T cells in microbial and tumor immunity and in co-ordinating immune response.Non-peptidic antigen recognition by T cells is the subject of our scientific interest. Recently, we focused on T cells recognizing metabolite antigens presented by the MR1 restriction molecule. The immunological functions of this novel population of T cells are still poorly characterized and their role in diseases remains to be investigated. Unexpectedly, these studies are unravelling a new world of antigens consisting of small metabolites that may accumulate within bacterial cells, tumor cells and activated B cells. The coordinated regulation of cellular metabolism and its alteration in bacteria and host cells are novel perspectives for understanding how metabolite-specific T cells participate in host defences and immune homeostasis. We plan to address three aspects:1.The repertoire of metabolite antigens stimulating MR1-restricted T cells.2.The metabolome regulation and the mechanisms of metabolite-presentation by MR1.3.The role of MR1-restricted T cells in the immune response.These studies will take advantage of a combination of state-of-the-art methodologies: cellular techniques to isolate and characterize MR1-restricted T cells, single cell transcriptomics and multidimensional flow-cytometry to investigate the presence of distinct MR1-restricted T cell populations, knock-out cells by CRISPR/Cas9 technique to identify key genes involved in MR1 antigen-presentation, and biochemical tools (HPLC separation and mass spectrometry) to identify novel stimulatory metabolites. Finally, two novel models of TCR retrogenic mice will be generated to investigate the regulatory role of MR1-restricted T cells in antibody responses and in tumor immunosurveillance.Overall, these studies aim at understanding the physiological implications of metabolite antigen recognition by T lymphocytes. Targeting metabolite-specific responses may represent a so far unforeseen immune strategy for inducing more efficient responses to microbial and tumor antigens.

427	Dr Ababneh Nidaa	ETH Zurich	2015-04-01	2018-03-31	CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing in stem cell organoids to functionally characterize regulators of tissue homeostasis and tumor driver genes	In metazoans older differentiated and damaged cells are typically lost by apoptosis and replaced by the progeny of dividing somatic stem cells. Accurate regulation of somatic stem cell proliferation and differentiation is therefore essential for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Disruptions in these regulatory mechanisms may cause tissue dysfunction and the formation of neoplasia. Normally, such disorders are caused by spontaneous mutations in oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, which allow stem cells to expand beyond their niche and to proliferate and survive without the normally required signals. Accumulation of additional tumor driver mutations can further transforms neoplasia into a malignant carcinoma. With the proposed project we aim to identify and characterize novel regulators of somatic stem cell proliferation and differentiation, which when mutated drive tumor formation and progression. As a model we will focus on intestinal stem cells, which when provided with the right niche factors can be grown in vitro in organoid cultures. Importantly in this system they retain their natural characteristics and form a polarized epithelium that contains all specialized cell types of the intestine. We hypothesize that genes which are (a) specifically expressed in somatic stem cells and (b) mutated at a statistically significant rate in cancer (tumor drivers) with high probability regulate stem cell/tissue homeostasis, and that they can be functionally identify by applying CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to organoids. We will therefore generate targeted libraries, and use them in FACS assays that quantify stem cell proliferation and cell-type proportions, and in survival assays in which normally essential niche signals such as Wnt and EGF will be blocked and downstream activating mutations will be identified. We will unravel the molecular functions of the identified genes using quantitative imaging and functional genomics approaches in mouse and human organoid systems, and complement the findings by in vivo mouse studies. Discovering novel mechanisms that drive neoplastic and cancerous transformations in stem cells will not only broaden our understanding of tissue homeostasis, but also allow to us develop new strategies for targeted cancer therapies.

428	Dr Ababneh Nidaa	University of Lausanne	2016-10-01	2019-09-30	Dendritic cell lines, new tools for research in immune response and tolerance	Dendritic cells (DCs) are hematopoietic cells that regulate the decision between immune response and immune tolerance. Since they are difficult to obtain in nonactivated state, show limited survival in culture and are difficult to isolate in sufficient numbers, we generated during the last granting period a panel of new CD8 murine tumor (MuTu) DC lines in a CD11c promoter driven large T transgenic mouse system. These cells share most functions and gene expression patterns with freshly derived wild type CD8+ DC. The current grant is divided into 2 major subprojects with 5 aims and 5 working hypotheses.1)DC lines. Aim 1: Derivation and characterization of new mouse CD11b DC lines. We have recently derived first CD11b DC lines after breeding the large T transgene into the BatF3 KO background and propose a detailed characterization of these new DC lines. We also will generate a series of CRISPR/Cas9 KO and knockin (KIN) DC lines, required to perform some of the proposed experiments. Working hypotheses 1a: These new cell lines are comparable to freshly isolated CD11b DCs and 1b: the CRISPR/Cas9 technology allows deriving the required cell lines. Based on preliminary results this part should be easily achieved. 2)Immune response and tolerance. . Aims 2: Having described during the last granting period two markers (CCR7 and IL12p40) that distinguish DCs activated with single signals (CpG, polyIC (pIC) or IFN-?), 2 signals (synergy, CpG+pIC) or 3 signals (supersynergy, CpG+pIC+IFN?) ????????????????? sh and CRISPR/Cas9 library screens to identify key pathways for synergy and ??p?????????. Working hypothesis 2: Using sh and CRISPR/Cas9 library screens we can identify key players in synergy and supersynergy. . Aim 3: Vaccination with tolerogenic DCs allows treatment of autoimmunity and delays transplant rejection. We will test combinations of tolerogenic DCs. Working hypothesis 3: We can change established TH profiles by applying single or combined tolerogenic signals to memory and effector T cells and we can use these DCs to allow transplant acceptance with transient immune suppression. .Aims 4: Since reducing gene expression of single transcription factors can alter whole programs of cytokine secretion in DCs we want to test other candidates and analyze the consequences of these altered programs for autoimmunity, infection, and immune response. Working hypothesis 4: Removal of single transcription factors allows to completely changing the cytokine profiles of activated DCs and hence results in altered TH differentiation patterns in vivo and in vitro. .Aims 5: Since CD11b reduces the available IL-6 and hence prevents exaggerated TH17 responses and its absence renders mice susceptible to autoimmunity we want to find the molecular and biological reasons for this effect. Working hypothesis 5: Tolerogenic properties of the integrin CD11b are due to CD11b signal mediated inflammatory or anti-inflammatory antigen presenting cell differentiation. We postulate that inflammatory and anti-inflammatory ligands for CD11b exist.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div. I-III)	525000.0CHF
429	Dr Ababneh Nidaa	University of Berne	2016-06-01	2019-05-31	Analyzing and modulating the epigenetic landscape of CDX2 as well as studying its function in colorectal cancer pathology	The homeobox caudal-type 2 gene CDX2 is required for differentiation, proliferation and maintenance of an intestinal cell phenotype. Our group has shown that CDX2 protein is absent or markedly reduced in up to 20% of colorectal cancers, which correlates with de-differentiation, metastatic spread and unfavorable patient outcome. Our preliminary data using a panel of colorectal cancer cell lines confirms that promoter hypermethylation is a likely cause of CDX2 expression loss, since CDX2 expression can be recovered upon treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi). Here, we aim to show that epigenetic modifications leading to CDX2 loss are clinically and functionally relevant and that these effects can be reversed by epigenetic therapies. Since these therapies have âglobalâ effects on demethylation, we aim to overcome the methylation blockade of CDX2, by establishing a state-of the-art method for specific targeting of the CDX2 promoter for re-activation. To achieve these aims, we will first determine whether CDX2 promoter hypermethylation causes CDX2 protein loss in human colorectal cancers and we will assess the relationship of CDX2 with the general methylator phenotype. Second, we take advantage of a fully-characterized cohort of colorectal cancer patients (n=750) to determine the potential prognostic and predictive relevance of CDX2 hypermethylation and protein loss. Third, we will identify novel transcriptional regulators of CDX2 based on transcription binding site prediction (e.g. GATA family members and p300) by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and validate results using other promoter assays. The function of these transcription factors in colorectal cancer cell lines after knock-down will be assessed. Our findings will be validated using fresh frozen material from our high-quality biobank. Fourth, we will determine the effects of DNMTis and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) on methylated and unmethylated cell lines in vitro and CDX2 expression. Chromatin structure will be investigated by analysing open and repressed histone marks and their effect on CDX2 restoration. To re-activate silenced CDX2 promoters we propose to use CRISPR technology to target either a transcriptional activation domain or the catalytic domain of the demethylating TET2 protein to the human CDX2 promoter. Small guide (sg) RNAs will be designed and tested to target nuclease inactive Cas9 fused to either VPS64, a transcriptional activator, or to the catalytic domain of TET2, a demethylating enzyme to the CDX2 promoter region. To further increase the chance of successful re-activation of the CDX2 promoter, we take advantage of an amplifier system based on a polypeptide scaffold (Sun Tag) fused to the inactive Cas9 protein. The Sun Tag will be able to recruit multiple VPS64 or TET2 proteins, fused to single chain variable fragment specific for the Sun polypeptide, to the CDX2 promoter region. We will establish CDX2 knockdown colon cancer cell lines and compare expression of CDX2 in methylated, unmethylated and genomically modified cell lines, then perform functional assays to determine effects on proliferation, migration and invasion. This will allow us to determine whether CDX2 expression and its function can be reversed upon modification. This proposal uses the latest genome editing technologies to uncover new aspects of CDX2 in colorectal cancers. Not only will the clinical and biological relevance of this gene be detailed, but new regulatory aspects of CDX2 will be highlighted. Additionally, successful targeted re-activation of an already-methylated promoter, as we are proposing to do in the project, may be further generalized to other important tumor suppressor genes and could have significant therapeutic potential.

430	Dr Ababneh Nidaa	Beckman Research Institute Department of Systems Biology City of Hope NCI Comprehensive Cancer Center	2018-04-01	2019-09-30	Pharmacological targeting of autoimmunity checkpoints (AIC) in B-cell malignancies	Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy in children and is also frequent in adults. Despite a generally favorable prognosis, the relapse rates of around 20% remain a major clinical challenge and ALL still represents one of the leading causes of disease mortality in childhood. Identifying novel treatment approaches aimed at preventing or circumventing drug resistance is therefore of great importance. B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling is critical during the development and maturation of B lymphocytes, as it provides survival and proliferation signals during the process of positive selection. However, hyperactivation of BCR signaling by a self-recognizing receptor leads to the elimination of autoreactive B lymphocytes during the process known as negative selection or autoimmunity checkpoint (AIC). The pro-survival BCR pathway is often mimicked by oncogenic drivers of B-cell malignancies, such as the oncogenic fusion protein BCR-ALB1, and current treatment strategies have focused on the inhibition of such signaling using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). However, the responses to TKI are usually short and resistant clones can emerge rapidly. Previous work from Prof. Dr. MÃ¼schenâs group has shown that B-cell malignancies are also sensitive to the activation of AIC and that the process of negative selection can be exploited to eradicate TKI-resistant B-ALL. Here we propose to investigate the pre-clinical potential of AIC activation as a novel strategy for the treatment of drug-resistant B-cell malignancies, based on the following aims:a.Evaluate and prioritize AIC agonistsHyperactivation of BCR signaling can be achieved through the inhibition of various negative regulators. We will establish a pre-clinical in vitro drug testing platform to compare and prioritize the different classes of inhibitors, as well as to evaluate synergistic combinations. The candidate drugs will be validated in vivo in a xenograft mouse model.b.Investigate the mechanisms of AIC-induced cell deathThe mechanisms leading to cell death during negative selection are not yet fully understood. We will investigate which cell death pathways are required for the AIC using specific inhibitors and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockouts for different cell death pathways, including necroptosis and energy crisis. Understanding the cell death mechanism will likely provide insight for further drug combinations.c.Integrate AIC activation into current treatment strategiesThe hyperactivation of multiple kinases via prolonged AIC activation raises safety concerns. We will explore dosing schedules based on a sequential treatment of TKI and a short pulse of AIC activation and investigate its potential to eliminate drug-resistant clones in xenografts in vivo.

431	Dr Ababneh Nidaa	University of Berne	2016-03-01	2016-05-31	Stem cell biotechnology and microfluidics for transcriptome and proteome analysis of motor neuron axons and somas in health and ALS	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a lethal disease characterized by the loss of motor neurons (MNs) innervating voluntary muscles. ALS can be inherited familial (Ë10%) due to mutations in several genes including e.g. superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), the DNA/RNA-binding proteins TDP-43 or FUS and C9ORF72. Animal models of familial ALS have demonstrated that intrinsic events within MNs are crucial for initiation of degeneration. From these models, we also know that the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) are primary affected before the onset of central MN loss. Thus it is likely that communication between muscle and MNs is altered with disease. Signals from MN to muscle (anterograde) and from muscle to MN (retrograde) are key regulators of development, maturation and stability of the NMJ. However, the contributions of MNs and muscle to these processes remain unclear, in particular the roles for retrograde signalling. It is quite well established that local RNA translation in the synapse is important for temporal control of protein synthesis and synaptic plasticity. The synthesis of many synaptic proteins is regulated by mRNA binding proteins including TDP43 and FUS, which are mutated in ALS and have modified subcellular localization. Thus, it seems that distinct changes take place in the axonal and somatodendritic MN compartments with disease. In this collaborative project we aim to unveil those changes by studying a compartmentalized in vitro model of the human NMJ. Using stem cell biotechnology and microfluidics we will develop this in vitro system where MNs and muscle are differentiated from healthy human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) or hiPSCs harbouring ALS-causing mutations in the SOD-1, TDP-43, and FUS genes, respectively. Using the microfluidics devices, MNs and muscle are restricted to different cell compartments and only connect through the motor axons recruited to the muscle side. Transcriptomic and proteomic signatures with this compartmentalized cellular resolution would reveal normal and altered events at the MN soma, axon and muscle levels. However, this approach strongly depends on isogenic hiPSC lines. Patient derived iPSCs and age matched controls cannot be used as different genetic background and unequal differentiation potentials introduce too much variance in the transcriptome and proteome to filter out disease specific alterations.While the Hedlund group has isogenic hiPSC lines for ALS-linked SOD-1 and the Ruepp group recently created isogenic hiPSC lines for ALS-linked FUS there are no isogenic hiPS cells with ALS-linked TDP-43 mutations available. Therefore, we plan during the international short visit to generate hiPS cell lines with ALS-linked TDP-43 mutations using CRISPR/Cas9. The Ruepp group has already established genome editing of hiPS cells and will teach Dr. Aguila Benitez (Hedlund lab) the required techniques. At the same time Dr. Aguila Benitez will help the Ruepp group to set up microfluidics for proteomic profiling from pure axonal preparations of MNs. The aim of this international short visit is to mutually transfer knowledge and materials required to create isogenic healthy and ALS-linked NMJs to address the pathogenic mechanism(s) involved in selective MN degeneration in ALS, and to initiate a long-term collaboration between the partner labs.

In host-parasite systems, one intriguing candidate for a molecular driver of co-evolution is the rather recently discovered âadaptive immune systemâ of bacterial pathogens, encoded in clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (cas) genes. This project will investigate the dynamics of host-parasite evolution in the natural epizootic caused by the bacterium Mycoplasma gallisepticum in the North American house finch population (Haemorhous mexicanus). Genomic characterization of house finch M. gallisepticum strains revealed patterns of CRISPR evolution that suggest altered phage parasite pressure on the bacteria after the switch from poultry to songbird host in 1994. At the same time, the observed degradation of CRISPR in M. gallisepticum also suggests that CRISPR maintenance might be costly to the evolution of virulence during adaptation to the new bird host, offering an alternative explanation for the apparent loss of CRISPR function. To understand the evolutionary dynamics between house finches and M. gallisepticum we need to establish which of these two evolutionary processes, if any, are the major drivers of the observed changes in the CRISPR-system in Mycoplasma. Thus, the two main goals of this project are to investigate (i) the drivers of CRISPR evolution (i.e. phages) and (ii) the consequences of CRISPR change for functional properties of the Mycobacterium genome that are important for virulence evolution.Currently, the biggest obstacle to addressing these goals is the lack of knowledge concerning the phages involved in the Mycobacterium-finch system. In a first step, I will map the geographic and temporal diversity of phages and bacteria throughout the epizootic in house finches. Then, cross-infection experiments with historical and newly sampled bacterial and phage isolates will provide functional tests of CRISPR variants and reveal co-evolutionary patterns between the phages and the bacteria. In a second step, I will explore the consequences of CRISPR degradation for the Mycoplasma genome by checking for genomic signals of increased virulence known to be associated with âpathogenicity islandsâ. By connecting the effects of phage diversity on CRISPR evolution in the bacterium with the effects of CRISPR variation to genomic virulence signatures, I will be able to link a specific molecular mechanism to the co-evolutionary dynamics within a natural system. Such a mechanistic understanding of virulence evolution will fill an important knowledge gap in our understanding of host-parasite co-evolution in nature and in particular for emerging infectious diseases, where ongoing evolution may complicate prevention or control measures.

This dramatic neuronal increase is accommodated in a small volume due to the evolution of gyrencephaly (cortical folding). Gyrencephaly is presumably driven by the selective enlargement of a secondary, basally located progenitor region, the outer subventricular zone (OSVZ). In this project I will test if TRNP1 and Ã-catenin, regulating progenitor abundance in mouse neocortex, affect progenitor growth in human OSVZ and respectively, cortical folding. I will also investigate how genes identified in gyrencephalic disorders contribute to cortical malformation. For this purpose, I will use novel human in vitro cerebral models, which can be derived from reprogrammed somatic cells. The expression of the target proteins will be modulated by combining the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing tool with established gene manipulation techniques. Apart from standard immunochemical methods, the dynamics of neuronal migration and abundance of distinct progenitors will be investigated by up-to-date in vivo imaging. Finally, the functional implication of downstream candidates identified by RNA-seq will be tested by overexpression/knockdown in the human cerebral model. Taken together, the project links innovative tools with proven methods to understand the most complex feature of the human brain, cortical folding.

434	Dr Ababneh Nidaa	Terrence Donnelly Center for Cellular & Biomolecular Research University of Toronto	2014-07-01	2015-12-31	Systemic analysis of the gene expression reprogramming induced by environmental stress in cancer cells	Cancer cells express an altered metabolism that is characterized by high uptake of nutrients and aerobic glycolysis, a process called âWarburg effectâ. While glucose is metabolised into lactate and thus diverted from the TCA cycle, glutamine is used to fuel the TCA cycle and to meet the high demand of nitrogen and carbon in rapidly dividing cells. As tumours grow, the continuous secretion of lactate lowers the pH in the tumour environment and the high consumption of glucose and glutamine may locally lead to nutrient deprivation. Therefore, I hypothesize that cancer cells that drive malignancy must possess an adaptable metabolic state allowing them to survive stress conditions. My studies aim to identify and characterize the reprogramming events that enable adaptation to environmental stress, such as glutamine deprivation or acidosis. There are two parts to my proposal. First, I will generate antibodies targeting human cell surface states specific to defined environmental conditions using a phage-displayed synthetic antibody library. The recognised cell surface proteins will be identified by mass spectrometry and the affinity reagents will be validated across a panel of cancer cell lines. Second, I will use the CRISPR-Cas9 system to perform genome-wide gene knockout screens for genes essential for adaptation to altered environmental conditions, as well as for genes that are required for the expression of stress-specific cell surface markers. Identified gene candidates will be further characterized using biochemical approaches and the therapeutical use of the identified sensitizers and regulators of stress will be explored.Together, these approaches will foster the development of new affinity reagents that can be used to mark cell surface features that are linked to environmental stress conditions, identify proteins that are functionally associated with specific stress conditions, and provide a detailed understanding of the genetic factors required for expression of stress-specific cell surface proteins. Furthermore, the proposed research will identify novel sensitizers and regulators of environmental stress and is expected to reveal novel drug targets and tools for cancer therapeutics.

Louis Pasteur HÃ´pitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg	2017-03-01	2018-08-31	Mechanisms of Staphylococcus aureus leukotoxins inducing ETosis	ETosis is a form of cell death where extracellular traps (ETs) are released by neutrophils and macrophages, contributing to the innate immune response. ETs are formed in response to bi-component leukotoxins (LukS-PV/LukF-PV for PVL and HlgC/HlgB for Hlg) of the Gram + bacterium Staphylococcus (S.) aureus, in order to trap and kill the invading pathogen. ETosis may thus, be beneficial for pathogenic infections, but may also present negative effects such as tissue damage due to inflammation or bacterial clearing of the ETs. Thus, as their precise role remains scarce, it is essential to understand the signaling mechanisms of ETosis and identify potentially different signaling pathways in response to the different leukotoxins. My objectives will be to identify differences in the intracellular signaling pathways during ETosis triggered by S. aureus leukotoxins (LukS-PV/LukF-PV and HlgC/HlgB), as well as by their cross combinations (HlgC/LukF-PV and LukS-PV/HlgB) to determine their specific roles. Transcriptomics will be applied for the analysis of these differences, followed by the Clustered Regularly-Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system for gene knockout in order to confirm the implication of specific genes in ETosis. This would shed light on whether only one or both proteins of these leukotoxins are responsible for the activation of different signaling pathways in ETosis. Finally, inhibitor identifications of this induced ETosis by targeting identified signals is essential for the prevention of severe tissue damage in response to S. aureus infections, as this bacterium is known for its DNase production, favoring replication through the released DNA from ETs. This study favors the discovery of specific signaling pathways during ETosis in response to bacterial toxins and the detection of well adapted inhibitors for ETosis. The study of host and pathogen factors involved in cell death resulting in extensive tissue damage may thus be facilitated, as well as the establishment of a therapy resulting in the bacterial clearance in some severe human infections.

436	Dr Ababneh Nidaa	University of Berne	2016-12-01	2019-11-30	Phenotypic and genomic characterization of stem-like cancer cells surviving castration in human prostate cancer	Approximately a quarter of aggressive prostate cancers progress to a lethal disease due to the emergence of resistance to chemical or surgical androgen deprivation therapy. The cancer stem cell hypothesis proposes that a rare subpopulation of cells within a tumor possesses the key features of stem cells, namely self-renewal and multi-potency, and that these stem-like cancer cells arise from oncogenic transformation of normal stem cells or closely related multi-potent progenitors. Patient-derived xenografts of prostate cancer represent excellent models to explore the biological and molecular implications of the cancer stem cell hypothesis in the progression to castration resistant prostate cancer, and to identify key features of putative stem/progenitor-like PCa cells that are likely to be at its origin. Based on our previous work and on ongoing studies on normal prostate epithelial stem/progenitor cells, we plan to investigate the two following aims:1. To identify/characterize pre-existing stem/progenitor-like PCa cells based on differential resistance to castration for survival and/or growth2. To investigate the molecular phenotype and/or genetic switch that confers androgen independent growth in a pre-existing stem/progenitor-like PCa cellsThe phenotype, genomic aberrations and the functional role of stem/progenitor-like prostate cancer cells as tumor-initiating/re-initiating cells in castration resistant prostate cancer will be studied in two pairs of patient-derived xenografts. Each pair of patient-derived xenografts represents models either of androgen independent prostate cancer for survival, but not growth (BM18 and PC-82 models) or of prostate cancer independent for both, survival and growth (LAPC-4/-9). According to the selection model, castration/regeneration strategy will facilitate the identification/selection of pre-existing in vivo tumor re-initiating, stem/progenitor-like prostate cancer cells under androgen deprivation. A parallel castration/regeneration strategy for in vitro organoid-initiating cell(s) from cell subpopulation(s) surviving castration in the four patient derived xenograft models will further certify their stem/progenitor-like properties (self-renewal, expansion and differentiation) and characterize their phenotype. An unique set of markers (ALDH, CD44, CRIPTO and MCAM) will be employed for their identification/selection. A comparative, genomic and transcriptomic analysis of tumor re-initiating and organoid-initiating stem/progenitor-like prostate cancer cell populations from the two sets of patient derived xenografts will be then performed. Putative, castration resistant prostate cancer-âdrivingâ mutations found in LAPC-4/-9 will be assessed for functionality by genome editing (CRISPR-Cas9) in BM18 and PC-82.Our goal is to expand our understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling intrinsic resistance to androgen deprivation therapy. Such information will be important for understanding why prostate cancer relapse as castration resistant prostate cancer is invariably fatal and for developing better treatments for castration resistant prostate cancer. Additionally, these studies could lead to the identification of novel mechanisms of castration resistance that could be translated into biomarkers able to distinguish indolent from aggressive prostate cancer and provide surrogate end-point markers for monitoring prostate cancer treatments. The uniqueness of this proposal lies in: a) the assessment of the value of a novel stem/progenitor-like prostate cancer cell signature; b) the comparative phenotypic and genomic analysis of preclinical models, in vitro and in vivo, that differ in their capacity for growth progression under androgen deprivation; c) the reverse genetic approach on stem/progenitor-like prostate cancer cell; d) the evaluation of the prognostic value of the stem/progenitor-like prostate cancer cell signature(s) on tissue micro arrays.The proposed study may provide an invaluable translational tool for stratifying early-stage prostate cancer patients at risk of castration resistant prostate cancer progression. It may also propose novel therapeutic targets for a curative intent.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div. I-III)	429000.0CHF
437	Dr Ababneh Nidaa	Jonkers Laboratory Molecular Pathology Netherlands Cancer Institute	2015-09-01	2015-11-30	Genome-wide loss-of-function screens to identify platinum drug resistance mechanisms	Resistance to anti-cancer therapy is a major handicap in clinical oncology. Despite the benefit of chemotherapy, patients with disseminated solid cancers are usually not cured and eventually develop resistance to all drugs available. The precise mechanisms underlying resistance are often unclear, however. A good example are platinum-based drugs, such as cisplatin and carboplatin. They are particularly effective to treat patients with BRCA1/2-mutated breast or ovarian carcinomas. Due to the BRCA1/2 deficiency the tumor cells are unable to repair chemotherapy-induced DNA damage by homology-directed DNA repair and many tumor cells undergo cell death. However, most of the patients with tumor metastasis develop secondary resistance eventually. Moreover, many patients hardly respond upfront and only suffer from the severe side effects of the chemotherapy. Since the underlying mechanisms of drug resistance are not fully understood, the therapy response of the BRCA1/2-deficient cancers is difficult to predict. Several cases of resistance may be explained by secondary mutations that restore BRCA1/2 function, but these do not explain all cases of resistance.The goal of this project is to identify novel mechanisms that explain the poor drug response of BRCA1/2-deficient tumors. For this purpose genome-wide loss-of-function screens will be applied as an unbiased and versatile tool to search for new resistance mechanisms. The use of the new generation CRISPR-Cas9 screening technology allows permanent gene knockouts in diploid cells. By testing about 130,000 single guide RNAs that result in the mutagenesis of about 20,600 genes, the functional relevance of these genes on drug resistance can be tested. In this project, the genome-wide screen will be conducted on mouse cells derived from BRCA1/2-deficient mammary tumors using platinum drug selection. The advantage of these cells is that mechanisms of resistance can also be validated in vivo. This project will hopefully unravel new mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance, providing new targets for anti-cancer therapy. The broader understanding of therapy resistance will allow more tailored therapy possibilities increasing the patientâs benefit in terms of a better prognosis and less therapy side effects.

438	Dr Ababneh Nidaa	Developmental Biology Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center	2014-12-01	2015-11-30	Follow-up: Detailed assessment of the potential of pluripotent stem cell based in vitro disease modeling using Familial Dysautonomia	The main goal of this proposal is to explore the full potential of disease modeling usingpluripotent stem cells. In particular the goal of the Follow-up proposal for my AdvancedPostdoctoral Mobility (APM) fellowship is to finish and improve the work on the proposed aims,complete an exciting new collaboration that may lead to the identification of a novel diseasemechanism using the in vitro modeling technology and start the application process for runningmy own laboratory.The neurodegenerative/neurodevelopmental disease Familial Dysautonomia (FD) is being used to establish the principle of disease modeling in a dish as valid alternative/addition to animal models. The use of patient specific stem cells enables the study of human disease pathogenesis, primary chemical compound screens and the validation of existing drugs.In a set of elegant studies, the Studer lab has previously established FD-patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiated them into neural crest (NC) cells, precursors ofthe peripheral nervous system, specifically affected in FD. Characteristics of the disease detected in patients were reproduced in vitro establishing the first disease specific, iPSC-based in vitromodel of a genetic disease[1]. Furthermore, the partial rescue of disease phenotypes was achieved using kinetin, a plant hormone. Remarkably, kinetin has now moved forward into actual clinical trials for treating children with FD. Finally, the FD-iPSC model also enabled the first primary high-throughput drug screen in human patient-specific cells, a screen which yielded new drugcandidates with distinct therapeutic action and potentially higher potency than kinetin (Lee andZeltner et al, Nature Biotechnology 2012)[2].For my APM fellowship I proposed 4 aims and have completed 3 of them. Namely: Idemonstrated that the stem cell-based disease modeling system in FD is capable of modeling the differences in symptom presentation (severe, mild or absent) among FD patients. Fibroblasts ofthese FD patient groups were reprogrammed to iPSCs (Aim 1), differentiated in vitro and used to investigate three next steps to establish the hESC/iPSC-based disease modeling technologyfurther: 1. The sensitivity of the system to detect differences in patient's phenotypes in vitro.After establishing a more defined and faster differentiation protocol for the derivation of NC cells(Zeltner et al., JoVE in press), I show that the FD in vitro model can recapitulate varying disease severity reported in the different patient groups (Aim 2). 2. The potential of the technology forthe study of disease mechanisms and drug discovery. I show that patients with mild FDpresentation are able to generate the critical cell types, i.e. NC, peripheral sensory neurons(pSNs) and autonomic neurons (ANs) similar to those in healthy controls. However, I also foundthat the reason those patients suffer from FD is due to a neurodegenerative phenotype in thosecells based on cell survival studies in pSNs (Aim 3). For the extension of my APM fellowship, Ipropose to optimize the established differentiation protocol for generating ANs (Follow-up Aim 1) and to assess survival similarly for FD-derived ANs (Follow-up Aim 2). 3. The specificity ofhES/iPSC-based disease modeling in FD (Aim 4). Originally, I proposed to use the AAV-mediated gene targeting technology to genetically modify FD-iPSCs. After failed attempts to modify the cells, I generated one potentially targeted clone. However, this clone showed abnormal growthbehavior likely unrelated to any gene correction event. Accordingly, I refrained from using it anyfurther. Thus, for the APM follow-up, I propose to generate gene-edited, isogenic FD-iPSCs pairsvia an alternative and highly efficient technology based on the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. I have already built the necessary tools for use in FD-iPSCs. The resulting isogenic gene-corrected clones should provide the final proof that the FD in vitro model is faithfully and specificallyrepresenting FD (Follow-up Aim 3). Furthermore, establishing this state-of-the-art gene targeting technique will also be a valuable tool for my future independent career. In Follow-up Aim 4, Ipropose to finish a recently established, multi-institutional collaboration on the molecularmechanisms of why severe and mild FD patients present with distinct disease severity despite their identical genotype. This work goes beyond the goals initially proposed in my APM fellowshipand has the potential to offer unprecedented insights into the molecular mechanisms of FD, andtherefore should result in an additional key independent publication.*references can be found in the main proposal	Swiss National Science Foundation	Advanced Postdoc.Mobility	429000.0CHF
439	Dr Ababneh Nidaa	ETH Zurich	2017-04-01	2019-03-31	Towards Therapeutic CRISPR/Cas9 Genome Editing	Targeted nucleases are widely used to modify the genetic information of organisms. Recently, the CRISPR/Cas9 bacterial immune defense system has been employed for genome editing, and has since largely revolutionized the field. The tremendous success of this system lies not only in its high efficiency, but also in in the simplicity of design. It uses short guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to specifically target the Cas9 nuclease to the desired DNA locus, where it generates double-strand breaks (DSBs). DBSs trigger repair by either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which is an error-prone process, or homology-directed repair (HDR), which enables the introduction of any desired base-pair changes.Numerous studies have already successfully used CRISPR/Cas9-meadiated gene editing to repair disease-causing genes in cell lines and model organisms, thereby raising hope for bringing therapeutic genome editing into the clinics. Unfortunately, however, these studies also revealed the limitation of this technology for in vivo gene editing approaches: in the majority of cases, CRISPR/Cas9-induced DSBs generate indels by NHEJ rather than precisely edited alleles by HDR. Because NHEJ is in particular prominent in quiescent cells, which do not express all the enzymes needed for HDR, novel systems that reduce NHEJ and induce HDR need to be developed to also apply CRISPR/Cas9 to in vivo gene editing in organs with slow cellular turnover rates.In the proposed project, we aim to develop a novel approach that enhances HDR repair of CRISPR/Cas9 induced DSBs in order to correct disease-causing mutations in the adult mouse liver, a tissue that is mainly quiescent. Considering that HDR is only active during the S/G2 phase of the cell cycle, we have recently engineered a Cas9:Geminin system which limits the generation of DSBs to phases when HDR takes place. We have already tested this approach in immortalized cell lines carrying a fluorescent reporter for NHEJ and HDR, and found that the ratio between HDR and NHEJ is indeed shifted towards HDR. In a next step, we would like to test this improved CRISPR/Cas9 system in vivo in the liver of mice that carry a similar fluorescent reporter for HDR and NHEJ. In addition to the blocking of DSB formation in quiescent hepatocytes, we will try to additionally boost HDR rates by treating mice with partial hepatectomy (PHx) after CRISPR/Cas9 component delivery, which ectopically induces hepatocyte proliferation. Finally, as a proof-of-concept study for therapeutic CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing, we will perforem long-term efficacy studies with these newly developed approaches to correct mouse models of the monogenic liver diseases phenylketonuria and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency.

Two important components of the HR pathway, BRCA1 and BRCA2, are frequently impaired in breast cancers. To specifically target the HR pathway, a novel therapeutic approach has been investigated: inhibition of the PARP 1/ 2 DNA repair enzymes induces lethality in BRCA1- and BRCA2-deficient cells but widely spares wild type cells. Despite the benefit of this and other DNA damage-inducing treatments, drug resistance remains a major obstacle in clinical oncology. In particular, mechanisms of therapy escape of HR-deficient tumors are poorly understood.In this project I aim to tackle the problem of drug resistance using a novel tool: at the Netherlands Cancer Institute I shall carry out loss-of-function genomic screens using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. For this purpose, I will use cell lines with large intragenic deletions of BRCA1/2 that cannot be restored. My hypothesis is that restoration of BRCA1/2-independent DNA repair is underlying drug resistance. I will therefore focus on a CRISPR/Cas9 library that targets about 500 genes that encode proteins involved in the DNA damage response.The Netherlands Cancer Institute is one of the world-leading institutes for cancer research. The group of Prof. Jos Jonkers has special expertise in large genome screening approaches using HR-deficient cells. I expect that the experience gained in Amsterdam will substantially broaden my knowledge. Moreover, I want to help establishing this revolutionizing technique when I am back in Bern. I hope that with this screening approach, I will identify new hits that explain why HR-deficient tumors acquire drug resistance.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Doc.Mobility	254922.0CHF
441	Dr Ababneh Nidaa	University of Lausanne	2016-11-01	2019-10-31	Mechanisms of basal and regulated mammalian RNA polymerase III transcription	RNA polymerase (pol) III synthesizes a collection of non-coding RNA molecules that are essential for cell metabolism. These RNAs include the 5S RNA component of ribosomes and all tRNAs, which are essential for translation, as well as several other RNA molecules involved in a wide variety of processes including processing of other RNA molecules and the control of pol II transcription elongation. Pol III recognizes three main classes of promoters, referred to as the class 1, 2, and 3 promoters. Whereas class 1 and 2 promoters are gene-internal, class 3 promoters are located in the 5â flanking sequences of the genes; they are highly similar to the promoters of small nuclear RNA genes transcribed by pol II, and they recruit several of the same transcription factors. The class 3 pol III promoters and the pol II snRNA promoters, which differ only by the presence or absence of a TATA box, thus constitute a nice system to dissect mechanisms leading to selective polymerase recruitment. In the first aim of this project, we propose to continue our studies to decipher the protein-protein interactions that lead to recruitment of the pol III-specific transcription factor BRF2 on class 3 pol III promoters, and the pol II-specific transcription factor TFIIB on pol II snRNA promoters.Pol III transcription is tightly regulated with cell growth and proliferation, and several factors involved in such regulation have been identified. One of these is a repressor called MAF1. MAF1 is inactivated by TORC1-dependent phosphorylation. Upon cellular stress leading to inactivation of the TORC1 pathway, it becomes dephosphorylated and can then inhibit pol III transcription by associating with the enzyme and/or some of its transcription factors. However, our recent results indicate that not all pol III genes are similarly down-regulated by MAF1. In the second aim of this proposal, we will determine whether pol III genes are brought together through three-dimensional chromosomal domains, and whether such domains contain similarly regulated genes. Down-regulation of the Maf1 gene in several systems leads to perturbations of lipid metabolism through mechanisms that are so far not understood. Our recent results have shown that MAF1 is a chronic down-regulator of pol III transcription rather than an acute repressor active only in response to stress, and that in a Maf1-/- mouse synthesis of tRNA molecules is greatly increased. Paradoxically, this leads to generally decreased rather than increased translation. We propose to examine whether much increased synthesis of tRNA molecules might lead to defects in tRNA modifications, themselves leading to defects in translation, and to characterize by ribosome profiling whether the translation defect is general or whether translation of some mRNAs is particularly affected. Several years ago, we noticed a mammalian interspersed repeat (MIR) present in an antisense orientation within the first intron of the Polr3e gene, which codes for one of the pol III subunits. This MIR was highly occupied by pol III and we noticed an accumulation of pol II at the end of the antisense MIR, suggesting that it might constitute a roadblock for pol II elongation through the Polr3e intron. We have used the CRISPR/Cas9 technology to engineer cell lines with a deleted MIR, and we observe increased expression of the POLR3E subunit. We will determine whether this leads to increased pol III activity in the cell, and we will compare the effect to that of deleting the Maf1 repressor gene. We will determine whether deletion of the MIR, or both the MIR and Maf1, has different effects on translation.This research will reveal mechanisms involved in the assembly of pol II and pol III transcription complexes and in the regulation of pol III transcription. It will further uncover an exciting new link between efficiency of pol III transcription, mature tRNA production, and translation, which opens up a new layer of gene expression regulation.

Although the number of HIV-related deaths has decreased continuously since its peak in 2005, curative treatments for retroviral infections are nonexistent, and it is estimated that up to 1.7 million people died from AIDS-related causes worldwide in 2013. Understanding the underlying biology of retroviral infections is fundamental toward developing successful antiviral strategies, such as preventive and therapeutic measures. The persistence of retroviral reservoirs in the cellular genome is challenging and has not been directly targeted by commonly used antiretroviral therapies against HIV. Animal models are needed to investigate host-virus interactions and to evaluate new therapies. As in humans, retroviral infections are prevalent in diverse animal species, including the domestic cat. The prevalence of feline leukemia virus (FeLV; a gammaretrovirus) infection in the cat varies greatly, depending on host age, health, environment and lifestyle. FeLV in cats is a well-established animal model for tumor and retroviral research that has been used for nearly 50 years1. After FeLV exposure, most cats develop a regressive FeLV infection, characterized by an early and efficient immune response mediated by neutralizing antibodies and FeLV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. This remarkable feature of FeLV infection in cats yields a great opportunity to study effective antiretroviral immune responses. However, approximately one-third of cats exposed to FeLV develop progressive FeLV infections with persistent viremia; these animals lack effective FeLV-specific humoral and cellular immunity. These persistently infected cats develop fatal FeLV-associated diseases, including lymphoma, leukemia, immune suppression and anemia, and they die within a few years of infection. It is very rare but possible for cats to raise a protective immune response and overcome persistent viremia on their own, even months after infection: we have observed full recovery from viremia in one cat more than one year after the onset of infection2. This proves that under the right circumstances recovery from an established progressive retroviral infection is possible. To date, no treatment regimen is known to cure persistent viremia in cats. In the present proposal, we aim to develop a method to aid cats in overcoming progressive infection-associated viremia by lowering proviral and viral loads. We will accomplish this by specifically destroying FeLV provirus in host cells using recently developed gene-editing technology in combination with oligonucleotide (ODN)-mediated immune system stimulation. We hypothesize that these measures will tip the virus-host balance in favor of cats, which in turn will be able to mount effective immune responses to overcome persistent viremia and subsequent infection-related fatality. We have shown that the use of CpG ODNs in cats is safe and results in decreased retroviral DNA and RNA loads in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)3. For gene editing, we will employ the RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease from the type II prokaryotic clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) adaptive immune system4. The efficiency, accuracy and simplicity of CRISPR/Cas9 makes it an extremely powerful tool that, when applied to the FeLV model, should yield an exceptional opportunity to investigate new anti-retroviral strategies in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Using CRISPR/Cas9 to delete or deactivate proviruses in the cellular genome offers the possibility of eliminating retroviral reservoirs from the genome, facilitating the treatment of retroviral diseases. The current application will address the above aim via two subprojects. In Subproject A, we will optimize a CRISPR/Cas9 system to introduce double-strand breaks into the FeLV provirus in vitro using FeLV-infected cell lines and PBMCs from experimentally FeLV-infected cats. We will assess the efficiencies of different CRISPR/Cas9 systems (targeting different sequences within FeLV) in introducing double-strand breaks that lead to nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ; SURVEYOR assay) and in reducing viral replication. In a preliminary experiment, we identified a target sequence within the capsid gene of FeLV that was most promising in reducing viral load. Additionally, in Subproject A, we will assess the safety of these systems in vitro. In Subproject B, we aim to construct a suitable gene therapy vector containing the CRISPR/Cas9 system for subsequent in vivo delivery (future project). The vector will be based on adeno-associated virus (AAV)5, and its safety and efficiency will be evaluated and tested in various cell lines and in PBMCs from experimentally FeLV-infected cats. Because the presence of pre-existing antibodies to AAV in a host6 may impact the effectiveness of gene therapy, we will also assess the presence of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies in pet cats in this subproject.A curative treatment for progressively infected cats is urgently needed in veterinary practice. To date, no effective treatment option has been offered to owners of FeLV-infected cats with progressive disease, leading to harm and suffering in both cats and their owners. Cats with progressive infections must be separated from other cats to prevent viral spread, and infected cats die from FeLV-associated diseases within a short period. As a non-ideal alternative, such cats can be euthanized upon discovery of infection, also causing distress and sorrow to pet owners.In addition to benefitting veterinary medicine, the results of the suggested project will also be of great interest to retrovirological researchers in general. In the current proposal, we suggest investigating the use of a gene-editing technology to destroy retroviral proviral DNA in an outbred animal. In contrast to mice and rats, cats have an average lifespan that enables the assessment of long-term efficacy. Furthermore, due to the different outcomes produced by FeLV infection and the possibility of mounting an effective immune response against the virus, the short-term efficacy of our approach will be immediately evident. While we recognize the differences between FeLV gammaretrovirus infection in cats and HIV lentivirus infection in humans, this natural animal model may yield proof-of-concept results regarding the efficiency of using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to target retroviral proviral sequences and reduce proviral loads in an outbred species. In contrast to HIV, the genomic sequence of FeLV is quite conserved throughout infection. Because the efficacy of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is largely dependent on matching gRNA to target DNA, applying it to treat FeLV is a promising strategy, and our goal should be attainable.Additionally, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has great therapeutic potential for treating latently infected cats, which parallel HIV-infected humans in several aspects. In cats with latent infections, the provirus reservoir maintains its full replicative potential even while suppressed by the immune system. Thus, if the immune system fails, reactivation of FeLV infection may occur7, similarly to what would be expected if antiretroviral therapy is halted in HIV-infected humans. Thus, the destruction of latent virus reservoirs in such cats is an ultimate focus of this proposal. This goal could be further addressed in future studies in cats with regressive FeLV infections. Finally, by surveying pet cats for pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to AAV, we lay a foundation for gene therapy in domestic cats.1 Willett & Hosie, Vet J 2013 195:16-23.2 Hofmann-Lehmann et al, Vet Immunol Immunopathol 1995 46:127-73 Robert-Tissot et, Vet Immunol Immunopathol 2012 150:1-94 Horvath and Barrangou: Science 2010 327:167-705 Kotterman & Schaffer.

443	Dr Ababneh Nidaa	Molecular and Cell Biology Laboratory The Salk Institute for Biological Studies	2016-04-01	2018-03-31	Identification of novel targets of AMPK	AMPK is a conserved kinase that serves as a master regulator of energy homeostasis. It is activated by energy stress and phosphorylates several cellular targets involved in metabolism to shift the balance toward more energy production and decreases anabolic pathways. Several of these AMPK downstream effectors have been identified by the host laboratory in the last decade. In addition, AMPK also affects gene expression by direct phosphorylation of transcription factor and modulators. This has been well studied in yeast and plants, while transcriptional effectors of AMPK in mammals are less studied.In the present proposal, I intend to characterize new downstream effectors of AMPK in two important compartments for metabolism regulation: the mitochondria and the nucleus. To this end, I plan to use stable isotope labeling in mammals (SILAM) combined with phospho protein enrichment using 14-3-3 affinity purification to identify proteins that change in sub-cellular localization, abundance or phosphorylation status upon energy stress in wild-type livers but not AMPK KO livers in response to the AMPK-activating drug metformin. The candidates identified will be further analyzed by in vitro phosphorylation assays. Candidates that show direct phosphorylation by AMPK will be mutated in their phosphorylation site using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in mammalian cells to study their relevance to the adaptation to cellular stress in response to AMPK activation. Altogether, these experiments will allow me to identify new targets of AMPK involved in transcription regulation as well as mitochondrial function and will broaden our understanding of the way AMPK mediates adaptation to metabolic stress.

444	Dr Ababneh Nidaa	Max-Planck-Institut fÃ¼r Infektionsbiologie ZellulÃ¤re Mikrobiologie	2015-02-01	2017-01-31	A genome-wide screen to identify effectors of extracellular trap formation in human neutrophils	Neutrophils are important mediators of antimicrobial defense as well as other immune processes. The cells are circulating at high numbers in the bloodstream, where they constantly control our body for infections. If neutrophils are activated by encountering a site of infection, they are able to respond to infecting microorganisms by a variety of defense mechanisms. One of these mechanisms is the release of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs), a structure of chromatin and attached proteins, which is expelled from activated neutrophils. The generation of NETs was discovered as a unique cell death pathway called NETosis and the released NETs are considered to trap and kill invading microorganisms. The mechanism underlying the process of NET formation is only poorly understood. This is in part due to the fact that neutrophils are terminally differentiated cells with a short lifespan. Therefore, genetic manipulations of isolated neutrophils are technically not feasible. This project aims to investigate the mechanism of NETosis by a genome-wide gene disruption screen. I previously established a cell culture system using a myeloid cell line, which can be differentiated into neutrophilic cells. These differentiated cells are able to form NETs and will be used to knock down or knock out genes by either RNAi or the newly developed CRISPR/Cas9 system, respectively. Genes, which are identified by this screen to influence NETosis, will be verified using different cell culture systems, such as hematopoietic stem cells with subsequent in vitro differentiation into neutrophils or human primary neutrophils. Target genes identified by the screen will also be verified in vivo in mice. This project will establish a method to analyze neutrophil-specific functions by genetic manipulations. Furthermore, the screen will help to understand the poorly characterized mechanism of NET formation as well as the in vivo impact of NETs during infection, which is of relevance for both basic and translational research.

445	Dr Ababneh Nidaa	Ebert laboratory Brigham and Women's Hospital / DFCI Harvard Medical School	2017-03-01	2018-08-31	Generation of mouse models of acute myeloid leukemia for the identification of genotype-specific therapeutic targets	Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most frequent type of leukemia in adults with an overall incidence of 2-3 per 100,000 individuals per year. Disease course is usually aggressive and still only a minority of patients can be cured despite improvements in long-term survival rates over the past decades. With the advent of massively parallel (next-generation) sequencing the mutational landscape of adult de novo AML has been elucidated and this has led to a paradigm shift in the understanding of leukemia development. In contrast to the previous model of leukemogenesis that was based on the concept that mutations in signaling pathways (class 1 mutations) leading to uncontrolled proliferation must co-occur with mutations in transcription factors (class 2 mutations) leading to blocked normal myeloid differentiation, current data suggest a more complex molecular pathogenesis. Although the number of recurrently mutated genes in AML is relatively small and adult de novo AML genomes contain only 3-4 driver mutations on average, recurrent mutations affect genes with multiple cellular functions including transcription factors, epigenetic modification and RNA splicing. Mutations in TP53 which encodes the fundamental tumor suppressor p53 can be found in approximately 5% of de novo and up to 30% of therapy-related AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients and are associated with a particularly dismal prognosis with very poor long-term survival even in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.Thus, better pre-clinical in vitro and animal models are urgently needed to both study the molecular mechanisms of TP53-mutant leukemia as well as to identify synthetic lethal interactions that may represent potential therapeutic targets.To achieve this goal, I will combine several experimental strategies. In a first step, I will generate an isogenic cell culture-based model of TP53-mutant AML. In a second step, I will use various complementary experimental approaches including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, IP-MS and a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 in vitro loss-of-function genetic screen to identify potentially 'druggable' synthetic lethal interactions using the TP53-mutant isogenic AML cell lines. Last, I will use mouse models of TP53-mutant AML to validate putative therapeutic targets in vivo. The findings will not only be informative on basic principles of the pathogenesis of TP53-mutant AML, but importantly, may hold the promise to improve therapies for patients suffering from TP53-mutant leukemia.

446	Prof Cole Stewart	EPF Lausanne	2016-01-01	2018-12-31	From genome-derived knowledge to diagnostics for leprosy	This proposal builds on the results of a collaborative pilot project between Professor Cole's group at the Global Health Institute, EPFL, and Professor Moraes' group, the LaboratÃ³rio de HansenÃ­ase, at FIOCRUZ, that was pursued in the framework of the Brazilian Swiss Joint Research Project (grant number #0112-01). The previous investigation, entitled âComparative Transcriptomics of Leprosyâ, generated the preliminary data and main hypotheses that we now wish to test in a more ambitious, integrated manner. Leprosy is an infectious granulomatous disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae, which can result in severe disabilities in humans if diagnosed too late, this neglected tropical disease remains a global health problem and is of special significance in Brazil. Diagnosis is confounded by the many forms in which the disease can manifest and by the lack of universally effective, evidence-based diagnostic tools. At over 31,000 new cases, the incidence of leprosy in Brazil is the second highest worldwide, after India, and the number of relapse cases after multidrug therapy (MDT) is the highest in the world. In addition, the World Health Organization is concerned about multidrug-resistant leprosy in Brazil as MDT is the sole means of controlling the disease.In the present project, we will use hypothesis-driven research to underpin new interventions in support of public health measures to combat leprosy in Brazil and elsewhere. Our proposal, 'From genome-derived knowledge to diagnostics for leprosy' is built around three specific aims that are interlinked and explore the same cohorts of patients and controls. In specific aim 1, for which substantial progress has already been made, we will compare the host transcriptome in whole blood using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) between leprosy patients and healthy controls in order to identify genes that are differentially expressed; the products of such genes could later serve as specific biomarkers for active and latent leprosy. We hypothesize that patients with active disease will display a different gene expression signature to that of healthy subjects as has been reported for tuberculosis. The protocols have been successfully established during the pilot study and the first datasets generated. However, these were too small to allow statistical significance to be reached so we will now investigate larger groups of patients and controls. Validation of the best candidate genes will involve a two-pronged approach. First, gene expression will be monitored by RNA-Seq before, during and after treatment in a small group of patients. Second, candidate gene expression will be quantified in different groups of patients and healthy individuals using RTqPCR. Expression levels of the newly validated candidate genes will also be measured in a population of household contacts and the robustness of the approach challenged by measuring expression of the candidate genes in a blind test. The expected outcome is knowledge about genes/proteins that differentiate between disease, exposure and cure. This knowledge could later be translated into a diagnostic application such as an ELISA test that measures the levels of a specific protein in human blood or a point-of-care diagnostic test.Specific aim 2 is linked to specific aim 1 and involves genotyping the patients and their contacts by means of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in order to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the host genome or signatures in expression of genes and pathways. SNPs will also be surveyed in two household contact populations, one who developed the disease and one who did not. From the literature and our own results, we expect to uncover SNPs in genes for innate immunity such as PARK2, encoding the ubiquitin ligase Parkin, or the NOD2 pathway (NOD2, RIPK2, TNFSF15, and LRRK2). In parallel, based on the results of the integrative approach, we will analyze the function of these genes using an ex vivo system. Genome editing will be undertaken using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to introduce these mutations into human THP-1 cells. The THP-1 parent and the resultant mutant cell lines will then be infected with live M. leprae and the host response compared either by RNA-Seq or by using highly sensitive ELISA to measure the levels of cytokines/chemokines associated with innate immunity, such as the type I interferons. In this manner we will confirm causality between the SNPs discovered and susceptibility/resistance to leprosy. Furthermore, this approach will allow us to rank the candidate genes in terms of their power and functional importance. Once again, this information could underpin a diagnostic test for leprosy or exposure to M. leprae.Finally, to complete this investigation in Specific aim 3, we will attempt to correlate the genome sequence of the M. leprae strain from each patient with his/her disease state, haplotype and immunogenetics. We have recently optimized a DNA extraction method, which includes a step for host DNA depletion, that allows us to obtain near complete genome sequences from human skin biopsies in a cost-effective manner. From the genome sequences, we will then deduce the strain genotype, establish phylogenies and predict the drug susceptibility or resistance profiles. All the genome-derived information will be centralized in a web-based relational database that also contains details of the patient's case history and demographics.Based on the successful outcome of our earlier collaboration, we are fully confident that we can complete all three specific aims in the allotted timeframe as the foundations for the investigation have been laid and the cohorts of patients and controls established or identified. We anticipate that our integrated approach will lead to deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of leprosy and to bilateral transfer of technology. Furthermore, the subsequent translation of the results of our investigation into diagnostic tools can be envisioned and this may provide a response to an unmet medical need both in Brazil and in other countries where leprosy remains endemic.

The latter has a major impact on human health as it leads to about 250 million clinical cases of malaria and nearly one million deaths each year in endemic countries. To date, no malaria vaccine is available and increasing drug resistance is observed globally. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of these parasites, which would lead to the generation of new drugs or a vaccine, is urgently needed. Most Apicomplexa are obligate intracellular parasites that have developed unique modes of invasion and development within the host. Key biological processes and events in the biology of these parasites are enabled by a number of specific ultrastructural features. Invasive forms (zoites) are highly polarised cells, sharing an apical complex of specialised secretory organelles that facilitate successful invasion of the parasite into its host cell. Once inside their host cell, the mechanisms used by Apicomplexan parasites to replicate differ dramatically from those used by their hosts. Closed mitosis is combined with a budding process to produce variable numbers of daughter cells that do not derive from fission but instead are assembled within the mother cell. These fundamental differences between host and parasite suggest that cell division could be a potential target for therapeutic drug development.The present study will mainly focus on a putative serine/threonine kinase, named Tg269730 in Toxoplasma and PF3D7_1145200 in Plasmodium, that appears to be essential for parasite survival and whose localisation and expression profile implies a role in the biogenesis of the parasite invasion machinery during the budding phase of intracellular replication. To elucidate the function of Tg269730 and PF3D7_1145200, a series of genetic and biochemical experiments are planned to address the following questions:1) What is the subcellular localisation of Tg269730? Super-resolution imaging will be performed on a Toxoplasma strain that contains an epitope tagged form of Tg269730. Colocalisation using several established markers of parasite division and organelles will be used. In addition, immunoelectron microscopy will be performed on a similarly tagged synchronisable Toxoplasma strain. Live microscopic imaging will also be performed if a fluorescent protein tag is tolerated and does not alter the localisation of the protein.2) Does Tg269730 play a role in the lytic cycle? What is the functional role of Tg269730? To answer these questions, a conditional gene disruption (Tet-off system) as well as expression of a conditional dominant negative (destabilisation domain, DD system) will be used to examine the phenotypic consequences of loss of Tg269730 function.3) Is Tg269730 a bona fide kinase? A wild type or mutant (dead) kinase domain of Tg269730 will be expressed in recombinant form and its phosphorylation activity will be studied in vitro using biochemical approaches.4) What is the subcellular localisation and functional role of the Plasmodium orthologue, PF3D7_1145200? For this purpose an epitope tagged version of the kinase will be generated to P. falciparum using recently developed genetic tools (CRISPR-Cas9 system) and a conditional knock-out will be performed using the recombinase-mediated DiCre system. The phenotype resulting from the disruption of PF3D7_1145200 will be analysed by microscopic and videomicroscopic examination of the various developmental stages in the blood stage lifecycle. All the work will be performed at University of Montpellier where expertise in a wide range of techniques and analysis applied to the study of Toxoplasma has been demonstrated (Lebrun laboratory) and where novel tools to generate rapid genetic modifications in P. falciparum (CRISPR-Cas9 system) have been developed (Lopez-Rubio laboratory).

There is increasing evidence that the underlying cause of disease is a perturbation of earlier developmental processes, but the mechanisms of normal adolescent brain development are poorly understood. Here, I propose a project to decipher the genetic programs involved in the neural changes occurring during adolescence. I will focus my analysis on parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons in the mouse cortex, as this cell type is a likely important contributor in shaping the adolescent maturation phase. I will implement a recently developed method to generate quantitative RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from PV-interneuron populations from pre- and post-adolescent stages. Analysis of these data will reveal differentially expressed genes that might be responsible for adolescent changes in PV cells. Furthermore, to perturb the expression of the identified genes and their related genetic pathways, I aim to develop a platform for efficient, cell type-specific gene editing, using a virus-based Cre-recombinase (Cre)-dependent CRISPR/Cas9 system. The findings from the RNA-seq screen and the efficiency of gene editing will be validated experimentally by advanced in situ hybridization for RNA analysis. This project has the potential to uncover the genetic programs underlying the adolescent brain maturation process and to reveal novel targets for further functional analyses of neurodevelopment.

It is a strategic priority for CRUK and CRUK Centres in Edinburgh and at UCL. Recurrent genetic and epigenetic perturbations in glioma have now been catalogued, but we lack functional genetic analyses in relevant preclinical models. This is essential if we are to define critical therapeutic targets for each disease sub-type. A unique opportunity has arisen to enable a step change in glioma research. We can culture patient tumour stem cells, as well as matched normal controls, and probe genetic and epigenetic alterations using state-of-the-art CRISPR-based genome editing. Edinburgh and UCL have expertise in these areas. The time is now right to link each Centre, exploit the combined large patient population base and link to developmental neurobiology at the Francis Crick Institute. Aims: We will create new open access resources â collectively termed the Glioma Cellular Genetics Resource (GCGR). This will stimulate new collaborations by creating much needed cellular models and genetic tools. Ultimately, it will accelerate innovative discovery science and provide new translational hypotheses. Key elements: There are five elements that are founded upon strengths in molecular pathology, glioma stem cell biology, developmental neurobiology and genome editing: (1) Patient-derived primary glioma stem cells: low passage, clinically and molecularly annotated primary glioma stem cells (across subtypes) will be generated, curated, analysed and stored, (2) Primary neural stem/progenitor cell reference controls: foetal, adult and patient-matched iPS cell-derived neural stem cells will be generated and provide crucial isogenic controls for genetic analyses, (3) Relevant genome-edited cellular models: CRISPR/Cas-based genome editing tools will be deployed to engineer genetic and epigenetic disruptions, as well as knock in reporters for live cell/tumour imaging, (4) Integrated open access database/portal; a dedicated âgatewayâ website will be created, updated and managed, providing a user-friendly resource for all information on patient-derived glioma cells (including their modified derivatives), normal reference controls, clinical/pathological genomic annotation and available genome editing tools, (5) PhD studentships: understanding normal brain development is fundamental to tackling glioma. We will collaborate with world-leading neurobiologists at the Francis Crick Institute through new PhD studentships to provide inter-disciplinary training in the shared research themes of neural stem cells and brain cancer. We provide a few examples of exciting scientific projects that will be enabled and accelerated. The GCGR has the potential to transform interrogative and discovery glioma research, and create new translational hypotheses.	Cancer Research UK	SEB - Centres Network Accelerator Awards	267208.0GBP
454	Prof Harris Adrian	University of Oxford	2016-02-15	2019-02-14	Role of a new HIF2 hypoxia response pathway in breast cancer regulating the long non-coding RNA NEAT1	Hypoxia, via induction of the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor 1Î± (HIF1Î±) induces a major transcription programme of high relevance to breast cancer biology and therapy. However a similar factor HIF2 Î±, although expressed in all breast cancer cell lines and in many tumours, is poorly understood. We have discovered a new pathway by which it functions in breast cancer by RNAseq of breast cancer cell lines in hypoxia. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play essential roles in tumour progression and metastasis. We found that many lncRNAs are regulated by hypoxia, and NEAT1 had the highest upregulation. This was by HIF2Î± not HIF1Î±, a first major role for HIF2Î± in any epithelial cancer. NEAT1 was essential for the formation of paraspeckles in hypoxia. Paraspeckles are intranuclear protein complexes, whose functions are just being elucidated and can mediate major changes in gene expression by RNA editing. Aims To investigate the role of NEAT1 in RNA nuclear retention in hypoxia, the effect on RNA editing, and their additional effect of retention of nuclear transcription factors. How these affect growth, survival and response to therapy. HIF2 and NEAT1 CRISPR/Cas9 edited breast cell lines will be investigated in vivo for effects on invasion, metastasis and response to anti-angiogenic therapy. Techniques and Methodology RNAseq of the A-to-I editing pattern in hypoxia and normoxia. Bioinformatics analysis to study the A-to-I editing pattern. SILAC RNA pull-down assay to determine which proteins bind to NEAT1 (besides the known paraspeckle proteins). Analysis of NEAT1 expression in human breast cancer samples by RNA FISH. Impact on breast cancer research Understanding the mechanisms by which HIF2 functions is fundamental to analyse breast cancer biology, and how hypoxia affects outcome, predictive biomarkers of functional hypoxia may help select patients for hypoxia modifying drugs, and we should find new therapy targets.

We want to discover and target the most important metabolic adaptations and inhibit bypass angiogenic pathways. The combined approach will allow us to induce synthetic lethality. Aims 1. To evaluate the downstream signalling pathways of the angiogenesis related cell adhesion GPCR, ELTD1 and the role of exosomes. 2. To investigate novel pathways regulated by Delta-like 4 [DLL4], on endosomal distribution and release of the Notch intracellular domain. 3. To investigate the role of interferon signalling, induced by DNA damage after radiotherapy, in survival of tumour endothelium and its modulation by DLL4 4. To investigate the mechanisms by which the glycogen shunt enhances survival and its potential as a therapy target. 5. To conduct screens in hypoxia of a transposon tagged haploid ES cell library, for genes critical for survival. 6. To investigate the heterogeneity of the hypoxia response within cell populations and its mechanisms of regulation. Methods We will use inducible endothelial knockout mice for the ELTD1 investigations. Use of a systemic endothelial targeted siRNA delivery system will allow analysis of pathways of angiogenesis in xenograft tumours. Several vascular models will be used including zebrafish, CAM assays, neonatal mouse retina. We will use cell line models in vitro and in vivo, with gene expression inhibited either inducible shRNAi or CRISPR if cells can tolerate that degree of suppression. Molecular pathology, tissue microarrays and samples from window trials will help to test our findings and feedback into the laboratory. High-resolution imaging will be used for our angiogenesis work as well as using nanosensors for metabolites. Mass spectrometry and magnetic resonance will be used for metabolic studies. How the results of this research will be used Combinations of inhibitors of metabolism and inhibitors of angiogenesis from our work will be tested preclinically. They will provide key information on mechanisms to achieve synthetic lethality and increase effectiveness of both antimetabolism drugs and antiangiogenic drugs. These will extend to Phase I and Phase II window trials with imaging and pharmacodynamic endpoints. We expect to deliver understanding of how new agents regulate ELTD1, evidence for our siRNA targets to undergo clinical development.

456	Professor Reed Simon	Cardiff University	2020-01-01	2022-12-31	INDUCE-seq: a novel tool for next generation risk assessment	Genotoxicity testing relies on the quantitative measurement of adverse effects, such as chromosome aberrations, micronuclei, and mutations, resulting from primary DNA damage, especially the DNA double strand break (DSB). Ideally, assays will detect DNA damage and cellular responses with high sensitivity, reliability, and throughput. Current assays involve in vivo cell-based analysis of surrogate markers for breaks, such as the gamma H2AX focus assay, or the tail moment of DNA from the Comet assay. The main regulatory assay for the detection of DNA damage caused by clastogens and aneugens is the animal-based rodent in vivo micronucleus assay. Novel next generation DNA sequencing technologies now make it possible to revolutionise the way we test for factors affecting the stability of the genome, and this could also include the testing of chemicals and compounds generated by humans, and those found in the natural environment. Furthermore, novel genome editing technologies offer the possibility of novel therapeutic modalities, which also need to be safety-tested for their potential genotoxic effects due to the established problem of 'off-target' editing. In this regard, we recently developed a novel method to capture DSBs induced by CRISPR-Cas9 editing of the genome, with a view to measuring such off-target editing. Remarkably, we have determined that the method, which we call INDUCE-Seq, is exquisitely sensitive to detecting DSBs in the genome over a very broad dynamic range. Current assays for detecting genetic damage (eg gamma H2AX and Comet assays) are far less sensitive. DSBs can be caused by both endogenous processes, such as DNA replication and gene transcription, but also by induced events such as restriction enzyme digestion, or nuclease-dependent genome editing. We have shown that INDUCE-seq is capable of simultaneously detecting both rare endogenous breaks in the genome, as well as highly abundant targeted breaks over a vast dynamic range. In this application, we seek to train a student in the principles of 3Rs research with a view to training them to help build the future tools that will replace the current use of animals in genotoxicity testing of novel chemicals and compounds. This will enable the safe development of new materials in the future. We plan to further develop INDUCE-seq to test for the measurment of chemical induced DSBs, to provide additional genomic DNA damage data to add to the battery of genomic and proteomic analyses currently being developed in the drive to establish the necessary tools for next generation risk assessment (NGRA). The aim of such initiatives, which include the EPAs Toxcast programme and the related Tox21 consortium, is the successful introduction of NGRA, with a view to the eventual elimination of animal testing of chemicals.

Novel next generation DNA sequencing technologies now make it possible to revolutionise the way we test for factors affecting the stability of the genome, and this could also include the testing of chemicals and compounds generated by humans, and those found in the natural environment. Furthermore, novel genome editing technologies offer the possibility of novel therapeutic modalities, which also need to be safety-tested for their potential genotoxic effects due to the established problem of 'off-target' editing. In this regard, we recently developed a novel method to capture DSBs induced by CRISPR-Cas9 editing of the genome, with a view to measuring such off-target editing. Remarkably, we have determined that the method, which we call INDUCE-Seq, is exquisitely sensitive to detecting DSBs in the genome over a very broad dynamic range. Current assays for detecting genetic damage (eg gamma H2AX and Comet assays) are far less sensitive. DSBs can be caused by both endogenous processes, such as DNA replication and gene transcription, but also by induced events such as restriction enzyme digestion, or nuclease-dependent genome editing. We have shown that INDUCE-seq is capable of simultaneously detecting both rare endogenous breaks in the genome, as well as highly abundant targeted breaks over a vast dynamic range. In this application, we seek to train a student in the principles of 3Rs research with a view to training them to help build the future tools that will replace the current use of animals in genotoxicity testing of novel chemicals and compounds. This will enable the safe development of new materials in the future. We plan to further develop INDUCE-seq to test for the measurment of chemical induced DSBs, to provide additional genomic DNA damage data to add to the battery of genomic and proteomic analyses currently being developed in the drive to establish the necessary tools for next generation risk assessment (NGRA). The aim of such initiatives, which include the EPAs Toxcast programme and the related Tox21 consortium, is the successful introduction of NGRA, with a view to the eventual elimination of animal testing of chemicals.

460	Mr Johansen Kristoffer	University of Cambridge	2016-10-01	2020-09-30	Signaling by novel PI3K effector proteins in T cells	The proposed research project seeks to describe and characterise the roles of novel PIP3-binding proteins in T cells by knocking out PIP3-binding proteins identified during a RNAseq screen with CRISPR/Cas9 in T cell lines, primary T cells, and eventually in vivo in mouse models. By using functional assays, such as ICAM-binding assays, intracellular IFN&gamma; staining, and APC-T cell conjugation assays, the identified proteins will be characterized. Key goals of the project will be: 1) To establish techniques for knocking out the identified PIP3-binding proteins in primary Tcells. 2) To functionally analyse the knockout T cells from goal 1 and identify novel PIP-binding proteins with roles in T cell migration, adhesion, or activation. 3) To investigate a select few novel PIP3-binding proteins in vivo either by bone marrow reconstitution with KO cells, T cell transfer models, or complete conditional knockout as established with CRISPR/Cas9 at the Babraham Institute.I expect that we will help elucidate on the signalling pathways involved in T cell function, and thereby potentially gain knowledge on proteins downstream in the PI3K signalling pathway that potentially could be pharmaceutical targets in cancers, autoimmune, and infectious diseases.

To cope with this, life has evolved multiple DNA repair and associated processes, collectively termed the DNA-damage response (DDR). While considerable progress has been made in identifying DDR proteins and their regulators, much remains to be learned about how they operate and are controlled. Building on our successful proof-of-concept studies, we will carry out genome-wide and focused genetic screens via state-of-the-art CRISPR-Cas9 approaches and haploid-cell based chemical mutagenesis. Together with ensuing validation and mechanistic studies, the proposed research has the following interconnected goals: â¢ To identify novel genetic and functional relationships between DDR genes/proteins, and between these and other cellular components, thereby providing fundamental insights into how mammalian cells respond to DNA damage and defining how such responses are controlled and coordinated. â¢ To establish how defects and deregulation of certain DDR processes affect cellular sensitivity and resistance to established and emerging cancer therapies, and to explore the potential clinical relevance of these affects. â¢ To expand our knowledge of how DDR processes are affected by protein post-translational modifications, particularly ubiquitylation and phosphorylation.

Progress in deciphering its molecular pathogenesis has accelerated dramatically in recent years, propelled in significant part by advances in cancer genomics. Despite such progress, the treatment of AML patients has remained largely unchanged for decades, with cytarabine, first described in 1961, representing the last major addition. This reveals a significant unmet medical need and to this end we have recently developed a powerful and flexible CRISPR-Cas9-based platform for the performance of genome-wide recessive screens to identify genetic vulnerabilities in leukaemia cells. We have gone on to adapt this platform to the study of AML cell lines and primary AMLs from genetically-engineered mice. Our results so far have i) identified circa 500 genes that are essential to AML cells and have the potential to serve as therapeutic targets and ii) given novel insights into AML pathogenesis. From this work, it is evident that the unbiased nature of these screens makes their findings orthogonal and highly complementary to hypothesis-driven mechanistic studies that we and others have been conducting. Aims In the proposed work, I plan to build on our findings so far to identify gene targets of differentiation therapy, search for mutation-specific genetic vulnerabilities in AML, study AML drug resistance/sensitisation and investigate the pathogenesis of selected AML subtypes. Methods We will combine CRISPR-Cas9 screens with our bespoke mouse models and other reagents developed in my lab to: i) identify potential targets for AML differentiation therapy, ii) define genotype-specific vulnerabilities of selected AML subclasses, iii) derive mechanistic insights into the function of AML driver genes such as NPM1 and DNMT3A and iv) identify ways to enhance the effectiveness of existing therapies by overcoming drug resistance and also by finding genetic pathways whose co-inhibition can synergistically enhance AML cell killing. How the results of this research will be used I anticipate that this work will generate important insights into the pathogenesis of AML and also identify novel therapeutic approaches and candidate target genes, the most promising of which will be taken forward for the development of new treatments against AML and related malignancies. Given our experience so far, I expect that we will identify several novel potential therapeutic targets some of which we will pursue ourselves and others which will be pursued by others in the AML scientific community.
