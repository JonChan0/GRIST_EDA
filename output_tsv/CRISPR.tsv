We maintain that the disease is largely preventable. The proposed research programme aims to reduce incidence and death from this common cancer killer. Aims 1. Elucidate the genetic architecture of CRC risk and gene-environment interactions 2. Define the molecular perturbations responsible for CRC risk 3. Use such new understanding to develop interventions to reduce CRC risk and mortality. Methods We will continue to build the wealth of patient sample resources that we have assembled linked with clinical, pathological, demographic and survival outcome data. Informed by GWAS/EXOME genotyping data, we will perform "Next-Generation" sequencing (exome/whole genome) in genetically enriched patient groups. We will use whole genome sequencing to identify regulatory elements correlated with CRC risk and elucidate their functional roles by linking expression data from colorectal epithelium in CRC patients and cancer-free subjects. A prioritised gene shortlist will be interrogated using genome editing (CRISPR) approaches to explore pathogenicity and functional consequences in mice predisposed to CRC. We also aim to develop new approaches involving CRISPR targeting of genes in cultured organoids derived from patient colorectal mucosa samples with the ultimate aim of correcting deleterious genetic variants associated with CRC risk. We will investigate vitamin D as a modifiable risk factor, and potential chemopreventative agent, interacting with genotype at CRC risk loci. Genomewide GxE analysis will be conducted, integrating WGS data for regulatory elements (VDREs) with normal/tumour expression (RNAseq). In vitro studies of human colonic organoids and cell lines treated with vitamin D will complement clinical intervention studies. We will biopsy rectal mucosa in human subjects treated with vitamin D, using various functional readouts. How the results of this research will be used Our aim is to identify genes predisposing to CRC and intervene to reduce the risk imparted by genetic variation at those gene loci. We also aim to develop vitamin D prevention studies stratified by genotype. We will also further extend our published findings of GxE effects on CRC survival outcome due to interaction of vitamin D level and SNP genotypes. This highly translational programme has implications for interventions in CRC prevention, survival and risk stratification in population screening programmes.

3    Professor Cowley Shaun    University of Leicester    2018-01-01    2022-01-01    A multi-user FACS facility at the University of Leicester    We request funds to purchase a BD FACSAria Fusion cell sorter enclosed within a Class-II microbiological safety cabinet (MSC) to establish a multi user cell sorting facility. The FACSAria Fusion is a highly flexible and advanced flow cell based flow cytometer that can perform multi-parameter four-way sorting. The Aria flow cell-based detection method provides greater fluorescence sensitivity than alternative stream-in air based cell sorters, which is critical for many of the proposed studies. We have requested funds for a four laser (blue/red/violet/yellow-green) 18-parameter instrument to enable high dimension analysis of the cells during sorting. The violet laser will enable use of highly sensitive brilliant violet fluorochromes and the yellow-green laser will allow greater use of multiple fluorescent proteins. The instrument can also perform single cell index sorting into 384-well plates, which will enable our research teams to undertake single cell transcriptomics projects and sort CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene edited cells. The instrument is fully integrated into the biosafety cabinet enabling work to be undertaken with primary patient samples and hazard group 2 pathogens. Maintenance, assisting new users and staff training are essential for such a complex instrument, we have therefore requested funding for an experienced grade 7 manager for a 4-year period.

4    Professor Loughlin John    Newcastle University    2015-05-04    2020-05-03    Exploiting osteoarthritis genetics to enhance cartilage integrity    Our aim is to make a substantial difference to the understanding and application of a fundamental cause of osteoarthritis: its genetic basis. Utilising a range of techniques, we shall take each known OA susceptibility locus and refine it to the point at which we have identified the causal risk alleles. Using stem cells, we shall track the activity of each susceptibility gene during chondrogenesis. These data will be integrated with gene expression analyses of patient joint tissues to clarify at which point during tissue differentiation the OA susceptibility genes are most active. Using stem cells and CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we shall then perform genome editing. This will be done on each causal allele, in isolation and in combination with causal alleles from other OA susceptibility loci, and the impact of the engineered changes on cartilage will be assessed. Overall our programme will 1) identify and validate OA causal alleles, and 2) investigate the functional effect of these polymorphisms by generating engineered cartilage containing defined risk alleles. In so doing, we shall uncover which polymorphisms and which combination of polymorphisms can be best exploited to create cartilage resilient to OA degradation. Our programme will therefore guide the development of new treatment modalities.    Versus Arthritis    Programme Grant Full application    1156602.0GBP
5    Professor Scott Christopher    Queen's University Belfast    2018-09-24    2021-09-23    Characterisation of the protease CTSS as a novel therapeutic target in TNBC    TNBCs are aggressive, difficult to treat breast cancers, which are associated with a poor survival. We have shown that CTSS expression is associated with TNBC and that its expression is regulated by the key TNBC driver, BRCA1. This proposal will examine CTSS as a therapeutic target in TNBC. We hypothesize that the induction of CTSS enhances the tumourigenic phenotype of TNBC and mediates key hallmarks of tumourigenesis such as invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. Aims: 1) Determine the specific phenotypic effect of CTSS in TNBC tumour cells. 2) Examine the impact of CTSS on TNBC tumour growth and metastasis using syngeneic in vivo tumour models. 3) Investigate CTSS expression in clinical samples and its association with tumour phenotype and clinical outcomes. Techniques and Methodology: We will investigate the role of CTSS in TNBC cell lines through its genetic ablation using CRISPR technology. These CTSS CRISPR lines will be subjected to a range of cell based tumour assays to determine which phenotypic effects of TNBC are mediated by CTSS. The CTSS CRISPR cell lines will then be used in syngeneic tumour models to examine the role of CTSS in primary tumour development and metastasis. Using flow cytometry and immunohistochemical analysis, we will also evaluate the impact of CTSS on the recruitment of immune cells to the tumour. Finally we will examine the clinical significance of our findings by interrogating TNBC tissue microarrays and dissecting the correlation with clinical outcome. Impact on breast cancer research: This project will allow the validation of CTSS as a therapeutic target in TNBC. TNBC is a heterogenous disease and all patients are currently treated with the same chemotherapy cocktail with limited clinical benefit. It is imperative that new targeted treatment strategies are developed, if the prognosis for these patients is to improve.    Breast Cancer Now    PhD    1156602.0GBP

19    Professor White Malcolm    University of St Andrews    2009-08-01    2012-10-31    The CRISPR system: a new frontier in prokaryotic molecular biology    The Cas-CRISPR system is a widely conserved prokaryotic phage defense system that has only recently been recognised as such. Many bacterial and archaeal species store short sequences of phage DNA as spacers in tandem arrays with conserved repeat sequences (CRISPRs). These confer immunity against infection by phage with the cognate sequences. The mechanism is thought to be analogous to RNA interference in eukaryotes, but specific details of the pathway are not yet known. The CRISPR arrays are associated with Cas proteins that have been predicted as nucleases, helicases, polymerases and RNA binding proteins. Together the Cas proteins are thought to process CRISPRs to generate prokaryotic short interfering RNAs (psiRNAs) that mediate sequence specific degradation of phage mRNA's. There must also be a mechanism to incorporate new phage sequences into the CRISPR arrays, but the mechanism is completely unknown. The primary aim of this work is to delineate the functions of the different Cas proteins in the defense against invading phage, using the model organism Sulfolobus solfataricus, which has over 50 Cas proteins. All proteins will be cloned and subjected to crystallisation trials and structural studies. Protein interactions will be analysed and the activities of individual proteins delineated. The prokaryotic equivalents of the Slicer and Dicer proteins from the RNAi pathway will be identified and characterised. The function of the large multiprotein Polymerase Cassette Complex (PCC), which we have recently purified, will also be tested.

28    Professor Reed Simon    Cardiff University    2020-01-01    2022-12-31    INDUCE-seq: a novel tool for next generation risk assessment    Genotoxicity testing relies on the quantitative measurement of adverse effects, such as chromosome aberrations, micronuclei, and mutations, resulting from primary DNA damage, especially the DNA double strand break (DSB). Ideally, assays will detect DNA damage and cellular responses with high sensitivity, reliability, and throughput. Current assays involve in vivo cell-based analysis of surrogate markers for breaks, such as the gamma H2AX focus assay, or the tail moment of DNA from the Comet assay. The main regulatory assay for the detection of DNA damage caused by clastogens and aneugens is the animal-based rodent in vivo micronucleus assay. Novel next generation DNA sequencing technologies now make it possible to revolutionise the way we test for factors affecting the stability of the genome, and this could also include the testing of chemicals and compounds generated by humans, and those found in the natural environment. Furthermore, novel genome editing technologies offer the possibility of novel therapeutic modalities, which also need to be safety-tested for their potential genotoxic effects due to the established problem of 'off-target' editing. In this regard, we recently developed a novel method to capture DSBs induced by CRISPR-Cas9 editing of the genome, with a view to measuring such off-target editing. Remarkably, we have determined that the method, which we call INDUCE-Seq, is exquisitely sensitive to detecting DSBs in the genome over a very broad dynamic range. Current assays for detecting genetic damage (eg gamma H2AX and Comet assays) are far less sensitive. DSBs can be caused by both endogenous processes, such as DNA replication and gene transcription, but also by induced events such as restriction enzyme digestion, or nuclease-dependent genome editing. We have shown that INDUCE-seq is capable of simultaneously detecting both rare endogenous breaks in the genome, as well as highly abundant targeted breaks over a vast dynamic range. In this application, we seek to train a student in the principles of 3Rs research with a view to training them to help build the future tools that will replace the current use of animals in genotoxicity testing of novel chemicals and compounds. This will enable the safe development of new materials in the future. We plan to further develop INDUCE-seq to test for the measurment of chemical induced DSBs, to provide additional genomic DNA damage data to add to the battery of genomic and proteomic analyses currently being developed in the drive to establish the necessary tools for next generation risk assessment (NGRA). The aim of such initiatives, which include the EPAs Toxcast programme and the related Tox21 consortium, is the successful introduction of NGRA, with a view to the eventual elimination of animal testing of chemicals.

31    Professor Dunlop Malcolm    University of Edinburgh    2016-01-01    2020-12-31    Integrative genomics in colorectal cancer susceptibility: developing risk reducing interventions through understanding biology    Background Cancer of the large bowel (colorectyal cancer - CRC) is one of the most common cancers (45,000 cases annually) and results in the death of over 40% of those who develop the disease. We maintain that the disease is largely preventable. The proposed research programme aims to reduce incidence and death from this common cancer killer. Aims 1. Elucidate the genetic architecture of CRC risk and gene-environment interactions 2. Define the molecular perturbations responsible for CRC risk 3. Use such new understanding to develop interventions to reduce CRC risk and mortality. Methods We will continue to build the wealth of patient sample resources that we have assembled linked with clinical, pathological, demographic and survival outcome data. Informed by GWAS/EXOME genotyping data, we will perform "Next-Generation" sequencing (exome/whole genome) in genetically enriched patient groups. We will use whole genome sequencing to identify regulatory elements correlated with CRC risk and elucidate their functional roles by linking expression data from colorectal epithelium in CRC patients and cancer-free subjects. A prioritised gene shortlist will be interrogated using genome editing (CRISPR) approaches to explore pathogenicity and functional consequences in mice predisposed to CRC. We also aim to develop new approaches involving CRISPR targeting of genes in cultured organoids derived from patient colorectal mucosa samples with the ultimate aim of correcting deleterious genetic variants associated with CRC risk. We will investigate vitamin D as a modifiable risk factor, and potential chemopreventative agent, interacting with genotype at CRC risk loci. Genomewide GxE analysis will be conducted, integrating WGS data for regulatory elements (VDREs) with normal/tumour expression (RNAseq). In vitro studies of human colonic organoids and cell lines treated with vitamin D will complement clinical intervention studies. We will biopsy rectal mucosa in human subjects treated with vitamin D, using various functional readouts. How the results of this research will be used Our aim is to identify genes predisposing to CRC and intervene to reduce the risk imparted by genetic variation at those gene loci. We also aim to develop vitamin D prevention studies stratified by genotype. We will also further extend our published findings of GxE effects on CRC survival outcome due to interaction of vitamin D level and SNP genotypes. This highly translational programme has implications for interventions in CRC prevention, survival and risk stratification in population screening programmes.

35    Professor Cowley Shaun    University of Leicester    2018-01-01    2022-01-01    A multi-user FACS facility at the University of Leicester    We request funds to purchase a BD FACSAria Fusion cell sorter enclosed within a Class-II microbiological safety cabinet (MSC) to establish a multi user cell sorting facility. The FACSAria Fusion is a highly flexible and advanced flow cell based flow cytometer that can perform multi-parameter four-way sorting. The Aria flow cell-based detection method provides greater fluorescence sensitivity than alternative stream-in air based cell sorters, which is critical for many of the proposed studies. We have requested funds for a four laser (blue/red/violet/yellow-green) 18-parameter instrument to enable high dimension analysis of the cells during sorting. The violet laser will enable use of highly sensitive brilliant violet fluorochromes and the yellow-green laser will allow greater use of multiple fluorescent proteins. The instrument can also perform single cell index sorting into 384-well plates, which will enable our research teams to undertake single cell transcriptomics projects and sort CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene edited cells. The instrument is fully integrated into the biosafety cabinet enabling work to be undertaken with primary patient samples and hazard group 2 pathogens. Maintenance, assisting new users and staff training are essential for such a complex instrument, we have therefore requested funding for an experienced grade 7 manager for a 4-year period.

36    Professor White Malcolm    University of St Andrews    2009-08-01    2012-10-31    The CRISPR system: a new frontier in prokaryotic molecular biology    The Cas-CRISPR system is a widely conserved prokaryotic phage defense system that has only recently been recognised as such. Many bacterial and archaeal species store short sequences of phage DNA as spacers in tandem arrays with conserved repeat sequences (CRISPRs). These confer immunity against infection by phage with the cognate sequences. The mechanism is thought to be analogous to RNA interference in eukaryotes, but specific details of the pathway are not yet known. The CRISPR arrays are associated with Cas proteins that have been predicted as nucleases, helicases, polymerases and RNA binding proteins. Together the Cas proteins are thought to process CRISPRs to generate prokaryotic short interfering RNAs (psiRNAs) that mediate sequence specific degradation of phage mRNA's. There must also be a mechanism to incorporate new phage sequences into the CRISPR arrays, but the mechanism is completely unknown. The primary aim of this work is to delineate the functions of the different Cas proteins in the defense against invading phage, using the model organism Sulfolobus solfataricus, which has over 50 Cas proteins. All proteins will be cloned and subjected to crystallisation trials and structural studies. Protein interactions will be analysed and the activities of individual proteins delineated. The prokaryotic equivalents of the Slicer and Dicer proteins from the RNAi pathway will be identified and characterised. The function of the large multiprotein Polymerase Cassette Complex (PCC), which we have recently purified, will also be tested.

The expression of DEXI, a gene with no paralogue in the human genome, is correlated with risk of T1D at the 16p13.13 region. Increased DEXI expression in monocytes is associated with protection from T1D, however DEXI's specific function remains unknown. Our in vitro work with DEXI manipulation in monocytic cell lines suggests that DEXI encodes a protein which impacts on cytokine responses to external stimuli. We have also generated the first DEXI monoclonal antibody so are now uniquely poised to investigate the function of DEXI effectively at a whole organism level. DEXI is highly conserved between humans and mice. We will test the hypothesis that reduction of Dexi expression using cutting-edge CRISPR technology in a spontaneous diabetes mouse model, the Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) mouse, will increase the incidence and accelerate the development of diabetes. Evaluation of the immune system of such mice will also provide insight into the function of the Dexi protein and potentially reveal novel T1D pathways and targets for intervention.

44    Professor Bingle Colin    University of Sheffield    2017-01-01    2017-12-31    Gene editing in the middle ear: Gene deletion at will for the study of Otitis Media.    The middle ear is an air-filled cavity, containing the three smallest bones in the body (the ossicles), which are crucial for hearing. The cavity is lined with a layer of cells, called an epithelium, which contains multiple types of cells that provide protection for the cavity. The epithelium surrounding the middle ear is the target of pathogens, such as bacteria, that cause middle ear infections (known collectively as otitis media). This is one of the most common infections of childhood – by the age of 3, over four out of every five children will have had a middle ear infection – and there are over 700 million cases each year across the world. It is the most common reason for prescribing antibiotics, and one of the leading causes of childhood surgery. Although in most cases, the infection is temporary and clears up relatively straightforwardly, if the infection becomes chronic (called chronic otitis media with effusion, or COME), it can cause permanent damage to the ear, and permanent hearing loss – over 100 million people worldwide are thought to have hearing loss caused by otitis media. COME is thought to be caused by an out-of-control inflammatory response to a trigger such as a pathogen, and this response causes changes to the epithelium itself – including an increase in the number of mucus-producing cells, which contribute to the effusion from the ear. The processes underlying these changes are not well understood – it is difficult to obtain samples of affected tissue to study. Professor Bingle and his team have recently developed a ‘model’ of the middle ear epithelium, grown in the lab from middle ear cells taken from the mouse, which will help us to better understand otitis media. The cells in this model grow at the interface between the liquid culture medium (which provides the cells with the nutrients they need to grow and develop and communicate with each other), and air – this is very similar to the way in which they grow in the middle ear, and makes this model highly relevant, as the cells develop and grow much like they do in the middle ear. One of the advantages of this model is that it will allow researchers studying otitis media to investigate the role of particular genes in the processes that lead to it. Using a new genetic engineering technology called CRISPR/Cas9, the researchers will edit one of the genes in the cells, called Foxj1, which is known to control the development of the mucus-producing cells that are implicated in otitis media (COME). This will not only demonstrate the ability to use gene editing to alter these cells to study the role of particular genes, but will also provide insight into how disrupting Foxj1 impacts on the middle ear epithelium as a whole, and the development of otitis media. This project could lead to the development of a new tool to study otitis media, and a system which can be used to test potential drugs for their ability to treat this condition, making it of great value to the research community.

45    Professor Jackson Andrew    The University of Edinburgh    2018-08-01    2023-07-31    The smallest of the small: determining size through cell number    Determination of organismal size is a fundamental biological question. Vertebrate size is established based on total cell number generated during development. Despite the 75 million-fold difference in size between the smallest and largest mammals, the mechanisms for this remain to be determined. This proposal seeks insight into how total cell number is determined in both pathological and physiological states. Over the last decade our study of extreme growth disorders has identified 18 new human disease genes. We established these encode core components of the cell-cycle machinery, providing cellular and developmental insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of these disorders. From our starting point of human disease, this approach also revealed novel genome instability genes informing fundamental research of basic biological processes. Still, the molecular basis for over half of individuals with microcephalic dwarfism remains unknown. This proposal will break new ground through the comprehensive application of Whole Genome Sequencing to our patient cohort to achieve screen saturation via identification of coding and non-coding mutations. Forward-genetic genome-wide CRISPR screens in developmentally relevant cell and organoid systems will also be developed to define key cellular processes impacting human growth. Beyond these ‘discovery science’ approaches, cellular and model organism techniques will be used to define the mechanistic basis for human disease caused by mutations in core replication machinery and key epigenetic factors. To extend prior work on pathophysiological mechanisms, we aim to establish a subset of microcephalic dwarfism genes as growth regulators, and thereby further define when and how organism size is determined. These studies will link essential cellular machinery governing proliferation with human disease, identify novel genome-stability factors and may yield insights into the developmental regulation of mammalian size.

Yet, on average only 37 new drugs are launched annually before undergoing risk-benefit analysis.

Withdrawal from market occurs in severe cases; 462 drugs were discontinued between 1953-2013 (=$396-650Bn), with unexpected cardio-toxicity the leading cause. Better methods and models are needed to validate potential drugs prior to animal testing, thereby minimising animal welfare, financial and patient safety issues. Our recent publications (2018) describe NC3Rsfunded work on the use of precision genetic engineering to develop stem cell models of genetic heart disease, specifically the prevalent and life-threatening condition of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Often ADRs or black box warnings arise because drugs interfere with each other or are complicated by underlying health issues. Of the top 200 drugs, 81 carry black box warnings and 82 carry ADRs for the cardiovascular system. Working with the Medicines Discovery Catapult, we will determine whether stem cell-derived heart cells can predict drug safety/toxicity, and whether this profile changes in healthy or diseased context. Successful project delivery would allow further funding to be sourced to progress the technology as a tool to assist routine cardiotoxicity profiling, ADR or black box labelling.

Moreover, we have discovered that this pathway affects the Chk1 inhibitor sensitivity of cancer cells undergoing replication stress, providing insights into patient stratification and potential resistance mechanisms for their clinical use. This programme of research will define NF-kappaB’s role in oncogene induced DNA replication stress. This will generate new insights and hypotheses that will be tested in vivo using mouse models and integrated with the work of drug discovery teams and clinicians. Specific Aims: we will determine: (1) The role of RelA T505 phosphorylation in mouse models of oncogene driven cancer. We will define the shared mechanisms and generality of the pathways controlled by Chk1 mediated phosphorylation of the RelA NF-kappaB subunit at T505 in the context of oncogene-driven tumorigenesis. (2) The importance of the NF-kappaB target gene Claspin as a regulator of tumorigenesis. We will exploit tumour associated Claspin mutations to determine its role as a regulator of Chk1 inhibitor resistance and tumour development in vivo. We will analyse mutations in Claspin and other genes associated with the Chk1 pathway that arise during the Phase 1 clinical trial of the CCT245737 Chk1 inhibitor. (3) How DNA replication stress regulates NF-kappaB activity in vivo. We will define how the NF-kappaB subunits RelA and c-Rel are regulated by the ATR/Chk1 kinases during oncogene induced replication stress. (4) NF-kappaB regulation of the cellular response to oncogene induced DNA replication stress. We will determine the roles of RelA and c-Rel in MYC-induced B-cell lymphoma, leading to new hypotheses that will be tested in mouse models and human cell lines. Methods: We will take a unique approach that combines existing and new mouse models, together with RNASeq, ChIP-Seq and proteomics to determine for the first time the pathways regulating NF-kappaB function during oncogene induced DNA replication stress in vivo. Furthermore, we will use and CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis in cell lines to perform mechanistic analysis of this data, including any mutations that arise as a consequence of the clinical use of the CCT245737 Chk1 inhibitor. How the results of this research will be used: This programme will establish the importance of the NF-kappaB/Claspin/Chk1 pathway in cancer with direct application to the treatment of patients with anti-cancer drugs targeting checkpoint kinases and regulators of DNA replication stress.

However, since a single microRNA can (and does) target multiple genes, for both efficacy and safety concerns there is a clear need to identify and selectively affect only the relevant (beneficial) target sites. No current approaches can do this and we will address this unmet need through the use of state-of-the-art genome editing technologies. To this end we have developed a very potent strategy using CRISPR/Cas9 mediated homology-directed repair for the assessment of microRNA response element (MRE) activity in human cells. In the current study such an approach will be applied to human chondrocytes to enable identification of endogenously active microRNA binding sites in phenotypically important genes. We believe these MREs, rather than the microRNAs themselves, to be the most appropriate targets for future clinical trials.    Versus Arthritis    Project Grant    220825.07GBP

However, since a single microRNA can (and does) target multiple genes, for both efficacy and safety concerns there is a clear need to identify and selectively affect only the relevant (beneficial) target sites. No current approaches can do this and we will address this unmet need through the use of state-of-the-art genome editing technologies. To this end we have developed a very potent strategy using CRISPR/Cas9 mediated homology-directed repair for the assessment of microRNA response element (MRE) activity in human cells. In the current study such an approach will be applied to human chondrocytes to enable identification of endogenously active microRNA binding sites in phenotypically important genes.

60    Prof. Soldati-Favre Dominique    University of Geneva    2016-10-01    2021-09-30    Molecular Basis of Toxoplasma gondii Encystation and Persistence    Toxoplasma gondii is the most successful obligate intracellular parasites infecting virtually all warm-blooded animals. A infection initiates with the dissemination of the fast-replicating tachyzoites. At the onset of the immune response tachyzoites convert into slow-growing bradyzoites that form cysts in the central nervous system and in striated and heart muscles. Encystation ensures life-long persistence and poses a significant threat of reactivation during immunosuppression and can lead to encephalitis and severe clinical manifestations. Despite the importance of encystation for pathogenesis and transmission, our insight into how T. gondii defies the immune responses to take up permanent residence in the immunocompetent hosts is rudimentary. We propose to determine the molecular mechanisms governing cyst wall formation and parasite adaption to encystation. We will capitalize on the increased sensitivity of -omics approaches, the power of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, the high-resolution microscopy, and on the ex-vivo tissue examination by MALDI imaging mass spectrometry and NanoSIMS technologies.The specific objectives are to: 1. Identify the components of the Cyst Wall (CW), Parasitophorous Vacuole (PV) and PMV Membrane (PVM) of the cyst 2. Determine the parasite factors responsible for CW formation and maturation via targeted and unbiased approaches 3. Define the metabolic network of parasite that is able to initiate encystation and ensure persistence 4. Measure subversion of host metabolic functions by parasite effectors during encystation and persistence We anticipate fundamental discoveries on i) the regulatory and trafficking circuits that govern CW formation as a biological barrier during encystation ii) metabolic adaptation and subversion of host cellular functions during encystation. Ultimately, understanding parasite strategies and versatilities that ensures its parasitism in immunocompetent hosts and bottlenecks as new targets for intervention.

Prof. Dr. SCHOLZE Petra    Medical University of Vienna    2018-04-01    2021-03-31    Human Nicotinic Receptor Polymorphisms in Synaptic Pathology    NICO-SNP Role of human polymorphisms in nicotinic receptors in synaptic pathology This ERA-NET Neuron application is a joined project between Dr. Uwe Maskos from the Institute Pasteur in Paris, Dr. Huib Mansvelder from the Center for Neurogenomics and Cognitive Research at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam, and Dr. Petra Scholze from the Center for Brain Research, Medical University of Vienna. This consortium brings together experts in molecular and cell biology (including human induced pluripotent cells, iPS), imaging and electrophysiology, and train 3 Postdocs in biology of addiction and translation. We will be addressing five major addictions, which all depend on the brain cholinergic system. The project is based on human genetic studies that identified polymorphisms of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors predisposing to smoking. In addition, four other addictions have been linked to this locus: cocaine, alcohol, opioid and cannabis. Thus, nAChRs belong to the most promising pharmacological targets influencing addictive behavior. The main objectives of NICO-SNP are the development and characterization of animal models carrying nAChR polymorphisms; the development and characterization of human induced pluripotent cells carrying polymorphisms and the identification of molecules which can be used to treat the addiction. In Vienna we will analyze functional properties and downstream effects of nAChRs in human dopaminergic (DA) iPS cells. Particular emphasis will be laid on two types of receptors: alpha5-containing hetero-pentamers, and alpha7 homo-pentamers. With the support of the French collaboration partner DA iPS cells will be genetically manipulated using CRISPR technology in order to either express the polymorphisms alpha5-398D, alpha5-398N or no alpha5 at all. Another line of DA iPS cells will be engineered to express human alpha7, plus/minus the partial duplicated alpha7 gene, which is found in humans only (CHRFAM7A) or no alpha7. Our preferred method of analysis will be Ca++ imaging, based on the Fura-2 technique. When indicated, Ca++ imaging will be combined with patch clamp electrophysiology in order to determine fractional Ca-currents. The prime agonists for creating dose-response curves will be nicotine and ACh (in the presence of atropine), and the specificity of effects will be established by adding antagonists like DHbE, MEC or a-conotoxin MII. Where indicated, activation of alpha7 receptors will be prevented by including 5 nM MLA in the drug application system. Experiments will show the impact of alpha5D or its N variant on intracellular Ca++ transients. Prolonged exposure with low concentrations of nicotine will reveal whether the genotypes differ significantly in their desensitization properties, whether receptor upregulation is maintained in the alpha5N variant, and whether nAChR activation affects DA production and the function of GABAA receptors. Experiments will further show the functional impact of CHRFAM7A, if any.    Austrian Science Fund FWF    Advanced Grant    299672.1EUR
62    Ao. Univ. Prof.Dr. VALENT Peter    Ludwig Boltzmann Gesellschaft    2018-02-01    2022-01-31    Impact of Age-Related Clonal Hematopoiesis on Evolution of Atherosclerosis in CML    Recent data suggest that hematopoietic ageing is associated with an accumulation of somatic mutations and that acquisition of such mutations is associated with an increased risk a) to develop a myeloid neoplasm and b) to develop life-threatening cardiovascular events. Correspondingly, the incidence of cardiovascular events increases with age and is higher in patients suffering from certain myeloid neoplasms. However, little is known about cellular interactions and molecular mechanisms contributing to cardiovascular events in these patients. One hypothesis is that clonal myeloid cells directly mediate inflammation and vascular damage and thus contribute to atherosclerosis in elderly patients. Another hypothesis is that vascular cells are in part derived from clonal pluripotent leukemic stem cells and that the acquired mutations alter endothelial cell function which in turn facilitates the occurrence of atherosclerosis. We and others have recently shown that patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treated with nilotinib or ponatinib have an increased risk to develop atherosclerosis and severe cardiovascular events. In addition, we found that nilotinib and ponatinib can directly induce alterations in the phenotype and growth properties of vascular endothelial cells. More recently, we have detected age-related somatic loss-of-function (LOF) mutations (TET2, DNMT3A, ASXL1) in patients with CML treated with nilotinib. These mutations were detected at the time of a major or complete molecular response and were found to cluster in those patients in whom a cardiovascular event was recorded during therapy. In the current project, the functional impact of age-related LOF-mutations and their distribution among hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells in CML will be investigated. In a first step, clonality of various leukocyte-subsets and microdissected endothelial cells will be determined at diagnosis and at the time of a major molecular response. Next, the effects of age-related LOF-mutations on macrophage- and endothelial cell function will be examined. The pro-atherogenic effects of LOF-mutations will be analyzed by measuring expression of pro-atherogenic receptors and mediators in endothelial cells and macrophages after CRISPR Cas9 or shRNA-mediated knock-down of TET2, DNMT3A, or ASXL1. In addition, the impact of LOF-mutations will be studied in Ldlr-/- mice crossed with LOF gene-deficient mice. In order to define early stages of pluripotent stem cells and their angiogenic potential in CML, we will generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from primary CML cells, and will explore the effects of various targeted drugs, including nilotinib, ponatinib, and lenalidomid, on differentiation of iPSC into endothelial cells and macrophages. The long term aims are to 1) identify target-pathways triggering differentiation of CML stem cells into endothelial cells and macrophages, to 2) define the pro-atherogenic and anti-angiogenic impact of LOF-mutations under drug-exposure, and to 3) identify drugs capable of interfering with stem cell differentiation into endothelial cells and macrophages and with the pro-atherogenic activity of LOF-mutations. The results of our study should contribute to a better understanding of pathogenetic factors and mechanisms underlying vascular changes in CML patients and pave the way for therapeutic strategies through which pro-atherogenic and thromboembolic events can be prevented in these patients.

The expression of DEXI, a gene with no paralogue in the human genome, is correlated with risk of T1D at the 16p13.13 region. Increased DEXI expression in monocytes is associated with protection from T1D, however DEXI's specific function remains unknown. Our in vitro work with DEXI manipulation in monocytic cell lines suggests that DEXI encodes a protein which impacts on cytokine responses to external stimuli. We have also generated the first DEXI monoclonal antibody so are now uniquely poised to investigate the function of DEXI effectively at a whole organism level. DEXI is highly conserved between humans and mice. We will test the hypothesis that reduction of Dexi expression using cutting-edge CRISPR technology in a spontaneous diabetes mouse model, the Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) mouse, will increase the incidence and accelerate the development of diabetes. Evaluation of the immune system of such mice will also provide insight into the function of the Dexi protein and potentially reveal novel T1D pathways and targets for intervention.

67    Univ.Prof. Dr. MARTINEZ FERNANDEZ Javier Augusto    Medical University of Vienna    2019-01-02    2023-01-01    Human ANGEL2, the first eukaryotic 2´,3´-cyclic phosphatase    The fate and function of RNA molecules is very much determined by the chemistry of their termini. In sharp contrast to the known role of mRNA 5’- caps and 3’-end poly (A) tails, the biochemistry and biology of terminal, RNA 2’,3’-cyclic phosphates remain largely unexplored. RNA molecules bearing 2’,3’-cyclic phosphates are generated by endonucleases, exonucleases or de novo synthesis, but their fate as intermediate substrates or final products of RNA processing reactions is obscure. Here, we report the identification and re-definition of the first RNA 2’,3’ cyclic phosphatase in eukaryotic cells; ANGEL2, a member of the CCR4-NOT family of poly(A) ribonucleases with no previously demonstrated activity. ANGEL2 converts RNA terminal 2’,3’-cyclic phosphates into 2’,3’-OH nucleotides, likely through a 2’-phosphate intermediate with implied consecutive 2’,3’-cyclic phosphodiesterase and 2’-phosphatase activities. We have introduced mutations in the predicted active site of ANGEL2 and abrogated its enzymatic activity. We have also generated knockout and knockdown cells by CRISPR and shRNAs, respectively, where ANGEL2’s activity was eliminated. Expressing wild type ANGEL2, but not a catalytic mutant, recovered the activity. The way is paved for a thorough biochemical and in vivo investigation of the unique biology of ANGEL2, which we predict has a large impact on RNA stability and turnover, degradation and cellular processes involving RNA ligation reactions. Within the next four years, we will: a) study the biological function of ANGEL2 by acting on 2’,3’-cyclic phosphate-ended RNAs; b) dissect the reaction mechanism and structure of ANGEL2; c) identify associated proteins by mass spectrometry and RNA-targets in vitro via RNA-protein cross-linking and RNA sequencing; d) characterize animal knockout models at the phenotypic and molecular level; e) identify patients harboring mutations in ANGEL2 and explore defects in RNA pathways; and f) take advantage of the unique enzymatic activity of ANGEL2 to modify current protocols to clone 3’-phosphate ended RNAs and preserve the 5’-terminal chemistry of both 3’-phosphate and 2’,3’-cyclic phosphate ended RNAs.

68    Privatdozent Dr. KLEIN Reinhard    FH Krems - University of Applied Sciences    2017-04-03    2020-04-02    Inhibitation of adenovirus replication by CISPR/Cas9    Immunocompromised patients such as HIV-positive individuals or solid organ and allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients are at high risk of undergoing life-threatening infections with human adenoviruses. Among hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients with disseminated infections mortality rates as high as 80% have been reported. The efficacy of commonly used drugs to treat adenovirus infections is limited and associated with nephrotoxicity. Alternative drugs are still under investigation. Hence, given the fact that numbers of solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients are constantly rising, alternative treatment options are highly needed. CRISPR/Cas9 is a technology that allows to knock out genes with high efficiency. It can be easily adapted to target any gene of interest. Consequently, it has been demonstrated to be capable of not only knocking out cellular but also viral genes and in this way to inhibit viral replication. In this project we want to investigate if adenovirus infections, represented by human adenovirus 5 (Ad5), can be inhibited by CRISPR/Cas9 in vitro and in vivo. To inhibit Ad5 we intend to target the viral E1A gene. The delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 coding sequences will be performed with a replication-deficient adenoviral vector lacking the E1A gene. Thus, this vector will not represent a CRISPR/Cas9 target. However, it will display the same tropism as the wild-type virus and its use will thus have the advantage of delivering the CRISPR/Cas9 components into exactly those cells that are the primary targets of the wild-type virus in vivo. Moreover, the vector will be turned into a replicating vector upon encounter with the wild-type virus. Hence, we anticipate it to locally spread around sites of Ad5 infection and CRISPR/Cas9 copy numbers to increase in Ad5-infected cells due to vector amplification. We intend to assess the inhibition of Ad5 in the immunosuppressed Syrian hamster model which is able to mimic adenovirus infections in humans. Because Ad5 has a natural tropism for the liver, we will focus on this organ when investigating the inhibitory effect of CRISPR/Cas9 on virus replication in vivo. Beside investigating the inhibitory effect on wild-type Ad5 multiplication we intend to determine the kinetics of vector spread throughout the liver upon mobilization of the vector by the wild-type virus. Lastly, we intend to investigate if concomitant inhibition of the viral DNA replication machinery by other approaches such as nucleoside analog- or RNA interference-based methods can help to keep viral DNA copy numbers low and in this way to assist in viral genome inactivation by CRISPR/Cas9. The results generated in this project may possibly lay the fundament for the future development of CRISPR/Cas9-based anti-adenoviral therapeutic strategies which may improve the treatment options directed against life-threatening adenovirus infections that are refractory toward conventional therapy.

69    Univ.Prof. Dr. KOVARIK Pavel    University of Vienna    2014-03-01    2017-12-31    Haploid genetics and genome editing in immune responses to GAS (Group A Streptococci)    Multidrug resistant bacterial infections are on the rise while antibiotic pipelines are drying out. This global threat urgently calls for novel antimicrobial therapies. Adjuvant immunotherapy represents a promising strategy to combat infections without fueling drug resistance. For this to work, protective immune responses must be scaled to the level of infectious threats (Blander and Sander Nat Rev Immunol 2012), thus allowing for efficient pathogen clearance while minimizing inflammation-induced tissue damage. However, the cellular machinery that accurately assesses these infectious threats in humans as well as the precise contribution of bacterial factors is not well understood. To fill this gap, we hereby propose to obtain an unbiased and comprehensive view on the bacterial recognition and human response network. To achieve this, we will exploit a unique approach and perform a genome-wide screen using haploid human immune cells (Carette et al. Science 2009) in which genes will be disrupted at saturating scale using gene trap mutagenesis (Carette et al. Nat Biotechnol 2011). By subjecting mutagenized cell pools to a selection scheme (e.g. survival, inflammatory response, internalization of PAMPs), mutants with desired phenotypes will be enriched and identified by deep sequencing. Following the identification of cellular targets, we will verify the functional relevance of these molecules by obtaining and testing cells from the human gene trap mutant collection of individual clones. This unique haploid clone collection contains conditional alleles, is DNA barcoded and will be provided by our external collaboration partner Haplogen and via the Research Center for Molecular Medicine (Ce-M-M-; Austria). Furthermore, we will explore CRISPR (RNA programmable Cas9)-mediated genome editing (discovered by E. Charpentier’s group) (Deltcheva et al. Nature 2011; Jinek et al. Science 2012) that has recently been expanded to mammalian cells, to inactivate genes of interest in relevant human immune cells (Cong et al. Science 2013; Mali et al. Science 2013). Finally, the biological in vivo function of selected target molecules will be investigated in relevant mouse models of infectious diseases. Using these approaches, my specific project part will focus on the inflammatory response to the medically relevant pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes, and a selected set of PAMPs, such as cell wall extracts and bacterial nucleic acid preparations, known to signal threat to the host. The unique combination of expertise within our consortium, covering haploid genetic screens, RNA-programmable Cas9-mediated genome editing and proficiency in innate immune responses to bacterial pathogens and bacterial virulence strategies, provides a clear competitive advantage and the ideal setting to successfully apply this innovative and discovery driven strategy.

70    Professor Rutter Guy    Imperial College London    2016-10-01    2019-10-01    Use of functional genomics to identify the causal genes at two novel type 2 diabetes loci    Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of the foremost health challenges currently facing developed societies. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 90 loci that are associated with T2D risk and most of the identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affect β-cell mass or function. A limitation of the above approaches is that they highlight broad regions in the genome (loci), and usually implicate multiple genes as affecting disease risk. Functional studies in model systems are ultimately required to determine which genes are chiefly responsible. The proposed project will take advantage of primary human islets and knockout mouse models and will analyse the impact on insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis respectively of the inactivation of genes close to two adjacent SNPs, rs4502156 and rs11071657, namely VPS13C, C2CD4A, C2CD4B. We have already generated mice null for the murine homologue of VPS13C selectively in β-cells, and will shortly receive animals deleted globally for C2cd4a and C2cd4b using CRISPR/Cas9 technologies through the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC). Subject to progress, studies will also be extended to the role of the PTPLB gene at the ADCY5 locus.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 90 loci that are associated with T2D risk and most of the identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affect β-cell mass or function. A limitation of the above approaches is that they highlight broad regions in the genome (loci), and usually implicate multiple genes as affecting disease risk. Functional studies in model systems are ultimately required to determine which genes are chiefly responsible. The proposed project will take advantage of primary human islets and knockout mouse models and will analyse the impact on insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis respectively of the inactivation of genes close to two adjacent SNPs, rs4502156 and rs11071657, namely VPS13C, C2CD4A, C2CD4B. We have already generated mice null for the murine homologue of VPS13C selectively in β-cells, and will shortly receive animals deleted globally for C2cd4a and C2cd4b using CRISPR/Cas9 technologies through the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC). Subject to progress, studies will also be extended to the role of the PTPLB gene at the ADCY5 locus. The appointed student will receive training in state-of-the-art imaging approaches, mouse physiology and bioinformatic analysis.    Medical Research Council    Research Grant    23516.0GBP
72    Univ.Prof. Dr. KNAPP Sylvia    Medical University of Vienna    2014-03-01    2017-12-31    Haploid genetics, genome editing and pneumococcal recognition    Multidrug resistant bacterial infections are on the rise while antibiotic pipelines are drying out. This global threat urgently calls for novel antimicrobial therapies. Adjuvant immunotherapy represents a promising strategy to combat infections without fueling drug resistance. For this to work, protective immune responses must be scaled to the level of infectious threats (Blander and Sander Nat Rev Immunol 2012), thus allowing for efficient pathogen clearance while minimizing inflammation-induced tissue damage. However, the cellular machinery that accurately assesses these infectious threats in humans as well as the precise contribution of bacterial factors is not well understood. To fill this gap, we hereby propose to obtain an unbiased and comprehensive view on the bacterial recognition and human response network. To achieve this, we will exploit a unique approach and perform a genome-wide screen using haploid human immune cells (Carette et al. Science 2009) in which genes will be disrupted at saturating scale using gene trap mutagenesis (Carette et al. Nat Biotechnol 2011). By subjecting mutagenized cell pools to a selection scheme (e.g. survival, inflammatory response, internalization of PAMPs), mutants with desired phenotypes will be enriched and identified by deep sequencing. Following the identification of cellular targets, we will verify the functional relevance of these molecules by obtaining and testing cells from the human gene trap mutant collection of individual clones. This unique haploid clone collection contains conditional alleles, is DNA barcoded and will be provided by our external collaboration partner Haplogen and via the Research Center for Molecular Medicine (Ce-M-M-; Austria). Furthermore, we will explore CRISPR (RNA programmable Cas9)-mediated genome editing (discovered by E. Charpentier’s group) (Deltcheva et al. Nature 2011; Jinek et al. Science 2012) that has recently been expanded to mammalian cells, to inactivate genes of interest in relevant human immune cells (Cong et al. Science 2013; Mali et al. Science 2013). Finally, the biological in vivo function of selected target molecules will be investigated in relevant mouse models of infectious diseases. Using these screens my specific project part will focus on the inflammatory response to the medically relevant pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, and a selected set of PAMPs, such as cell wall extracts and bacterial nucleic acid preparations, known to signify bacterial viability (i.e. threat). The unique combination of expertise within our consortium, covering haploid genetic screens, RNA-programmable Cas9-mediated genome editing and proficiency in innate immune responses to bacterial pathogens and bacterial virulence strategies, provides a clear competitive advantage and the ideal setting to successfully apply this innovative and discovery driven strategy.

73    Univ.Prof. Dr. Busslinger Meinrad Josef    Research Insitute of Molecular Pathology    2018-01-01    2020-12-31    Multifunctional Role of the PAX5-JAK2 Oncoprotein in B Cell Leukemia    B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is the most common malignancy in children and also occurs in adolescents and adults. Despite good prognosis in pediatric patient outcome, at least 15% of patients will suffer from relapse. Hence, a deep understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of this disease is needed to improve current therapeutic approaches. For instance, genome-wide analyses of genetic alterations in B cell leukemia identified the transcription factor PAX5 as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor in one third of all B-ALL cases. Less is known about the role of PAX5 translocations and rearrangements, which generate novel chimeric PAX5 transcription factors in a smaller subset of B-ALL. The PAX5-JAK2 rearrangement creates a fusion protein that consists of the N- terminal DNA-binding paired domain of PAX5 linked to the C-terminal kinase domain of JAK2. The PAX5-JAK2 rearrangement is likely a dual-hit mutation as it inactivates one PAX5 allele and leads to the expression of a constitutively active JAK2 kinase that could activate the JAK- STAT signaling pathway. Moreover, JAK2 can act as an epigenetic regulator by phosphorylating tyrosine 41 on histone H3 (H3Y41ph), which functions as an active histone mark to stimulate gene expression. To investigate the role of PAX5-JAK2 in leukemia development, we have generated a mouse model expressing the PAX5-JAK2 protein from the endogenous Pax5 locus. Pax5JAK2/+ mice rapidly develop an aggressive B-ALL tumor without the need of an additional cooperating mutation, which thus confirms the dual-hit hypothesis. Having established a mouse tumor model for PAX5-JAK2, we will investigate to what degree PAX5-JAK2 contributes to B- ALL development through activation of canonical JAK-STAT signaling and/or the non-canonical epigenetic pathway. We will identify and characterize PAX5-JAK2-regulated target genes by genome-wide transcriptome, PAX5-JAK2 binding and chromatin profiling analyses of Pax5JAK2/+ B-ALL tumors. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutagenesis will then be used to define the functional relevance of the top-ranked target genes for leukemia development. By analyzing the expression profile of human PAX5-JAK2+ B-ALLs, we will determine the degree to which the critical PAX5-JAK2 target genes identified in mouse Pax5JAK2/+ B-ALL tumors are also deregulated in the human disease. Collectively, these data will provide novel important insight into the molecular mechanisms, by which the oncoprotein PAX5-JAK2 induces B cell leukemia, and may suggest improved therapeutic approaches for the treatment of this B-ALL subtype.

Despite the global impact of helminthiasis, lack of access to tractable experimental systems is severely hampering research progress. FUGI will advance this agenda by developing reverse genetics, genome-editing tools and immortal cell lines built around the thorough characterisation and understanding of parasitic flatworm stem cell systems. Application of CRISPR/Cas9 methods for facilitating flatworm genome-editing will grant unprecedented control over individual gene-level investigations. Use o f this technology to derive lines of knockout/knock-in flatworms will be assisted by our experience in harnessing retroviruses as germ-line, gene-transduction agents. Creation of immortalised flatworm cell lines, based on the proliferative potential of stem cell systems, will allow lifecycle-free, NC3R compliant, helminthology to proceed at pace. By applying tools of human stem cell science to parasitic flatworms, we will produce self-renewable resources for obtaining biological material, for o ptimising genome-editing tools and for generating homologous proteins suitable for functional investigations. FUGI will produce enabling resources (stored in community-accessible repositories) that will provide our field, for the first time, with the means to characterise the gene products responsible for parasite pathogenesis and persistence. These functional genomics tools will allow the helminth community to ask fundamental questions necessary to accelerate the development of novel anthelmint hic drugs and vaccines.

76    Privatdozent Dr. KLEIN Reinhard    FH Krems - University of Applied Sciences    2017-04-03    2020-04-02    Inhibitation of adenovirus replication by CISPR/Cas9    Immunocompromised patients such as HIV-positive individuals or solid organ and allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients are at high risk of undergoing life-threatening infections with human adenoviruses. Among hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients with disseminated infections mortality rates as high as 80% have been reported. The efficacy of commonly used drugs to treat adenovirus infections is limited and associated with nephrotoxicity. Alternative drugs are still under investigation. Hence, given the fact that numbers of solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients are constantly rising, alternative treatment options are highly needed. CRISPR/Cas9 is a technology that allows to knock out genes with high efficiency. It can be easily adapted to target any gene of interest. Consequently, it has been demonstrated to be capable of not only knocking out cellular but also viral genes and in this way to inhibit viral replication. In this project we want to investigate if adenovirus infections, represented by human adenovirus 5 (Ad5), can be inhibited by CRISPR/Cas9 in vitro and in vivo. To inhibit Ad5 we intend to target the viral E1A gene. The delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 coding sequences will be performed with a replication-deficient adenoviral vector lacking the E1A gene. Thus, this vector will not represent a CRISPR/Cas9 target. However, it will display the same tropism as the wild-type virus and its use will thus have the advantage of delivering the CRISPR/Cas9 components into exactly those cells that are the primary targets of the wild-type virus in vivo. Moreover, the vector will be turned into a replicating vector upon encounter with the wild-type virus. Hence, we anticipate it to locally spread around sites of Ad5 infection and CRISPR/Cas9 copy numbers to increase in Ad5-infected cells due to vector amplification. We intend to assess the inhibition of Ad5 in the immunosuppressed Syrian hamster model which is able to mimic adenovirus infections in humans. Because Ad5 has a natural tropism for the liver, we will focus on this organ when investigating the inhibitory effect of CRISPR/Cas9 on virus replication in vivo. Beside investigating the inhibitory effect on wild-type Ad5 multiplication we intend to determine the kinetics of vector spread throughout the liver upon mobilization of the vector by the wild-type virus. Lastly, we intend to investigate if concomitant inhibition of the viral DNA replication machinery by other approaches such as nucleoside analog- or RNA interference-based methods can help to keep viral DNA copy numbers low and in this way to assist in viral genome inactivation by CRISPR/Cas9. The results generated in this project may possibly lay the fundament for the future development of CRISPR/Cas9-based anti-adenoviral therapeutic strategies which may improve the treatment options directed against life-threatening adenovirus infections that are refractory toward conventional therapy.

Progress in deciphering its molecular pathogenesis has accelerated dramatically in recent years, propelled in significant part by advances in cancer genomics. Despite such progress, the treatment of AML patients has remained largely unchanged for decades, with cytarabine, first described in 1961, representing the last major addition. This reveals a significant unmet medical need and to this end we have recently developed a powerful and flexible CRISPR-Cas9-based platform for the performance of genome-wide recessive screens to identify genetic vulnerabilities in leukaemia cells. We have gone on to adapt this platform to the study of AML cell lines and primary AMLs from genetically-engineered mice. Our results so far have i) identified circa 500 genes that are essential to AML cells and have the potential to serve as therapeutic targets and ii) given novel insights into AML pathogenesis. From this work, it is evident that the unbiased nature of these screens makes their findings orthogonal and highly complementary to hypothesis-driven mechanistic studies that we and others have been conducting. Aims In the proposed work, I plan to build on our findings so far to identify gene targets of differentiation therapy, search for mutation-specific genetic vulnerabilities in AML, study AML drug resistance/sensitisation and investigate the pathogenesis of selected AML subtypes. Methods We will combine CRISPR-Cas9 screens with our bespoke mouse models and other reagents developed in my lab to: i) identify potential targets for AML differentiation therapy, ii) define genotype-specific vulnerabilities of selected AML subclasses, iii) derive mechanistic insights into the function of AML driver genes such as NPM1 and DNMT3A and iv) identify ways to enhance the effectiveness of existing therapies by overcoming drug resistance and also by finding genetic pathways whose co-inhibition can synergistically enhance AML cell killing. How the results of this research will be used I anticipate that this work will generate important insights into the pathogenesis of AML and also identify novel therapeutic approaches and candidate target genes, the most promising of which will be taken forward for the development of new treatments against AML and related malignancies. Given our experience so far, I expect that we will identify several novel potential therapeutic targets some of which we will pursue ourselves and others which will be pursued by others in the AML scientific community.

84    Dr Wang Xin    University of Dundee    2020-01-01    2022-12-31    Modelling O-GlcNAc transferase Intellectual Disability in Drosophila    O-Linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) is an essential enzyme which is solely responsible for the dynamic cytosolic and nuclear O-GlcNAcylation of serine and threonine residues on over 1000 proteins. This modification is removed by a single enzyme, OGlcNAc hydrolase (OGA). Both proteins are essential for mammalian embryonic and perinatal survival, respectively. Recently, mutations in OGT have been identified as causal in intellectual disability (ID), however, the exact mechanism leading to this disorder are unknown. This studentship will endeavour to identify how two hypothesised mechanisms contribute to OGT-ID: altered O-GlcNAcylation and altered OGT:protein interactions. To achieve this the student will use Drosophila melanogaster as a model system. OGT is highly conserved from humans to Drosophila, along with many of its interactors, such as the mitochondrial motility protein Milton and periodicity proteins involved in the circadian rhythm. The student will dissect the molecular mechanisms leading to ID through achieving 4 aims. (1) The student will generate fly lines carrying OGT mutations equivalent to those found in patients using a CRISPR/Cas9 system. We have already demonstrated the viability of this approach successfully generating a fly line carrying a patient mutation. (2) These fly lines will then be assayed for a number of neuronal phenotypes, both morphological and behavioural. The former will be achieved using a combination of genetic and antibody labelling to visualize gross brain morphology, mushroom body morphology (the associative memory region of the fly brain, and an excellent model to study axonal morphology), and dendritic morphology using class IV dendritic arborisation sensory neurons. To assay neuronal function through behaviour, a light-off habituation test will be employed. This leverages the natural escape response of Drosophila to a sudden reduction in light, in nature signalling the presence of a predator, and measures their neuronal adaptation to the repetition of this stimulus without the ordinarily associated consequence. In preliminary experiments, we have found a decrease in habituation in OGT mutant flies. (3) The specific mechanisms driving the observed phenotypes will be dissected through proteomic and transcriptomic approaches. Quantitative O-GlcNAc proteomics will be conducted through enrichment of O-GlcNAcylated proteins with a catalytically inactive OGA we have used for this purpose in the past. The role of individual proteins or modified sites will be probed through genetic approaches, ablating induvial proteins to assess genetic interactions or individual modified sites by mutating modified residues to alanine. An additional approach which can be employed is the mutation of identified sites to cysteine. We have found this results in a SGlcNAc modification which is not hydrolysable by OGA, elevating the stoichiometry of the modification on a single residue. This is a technique which has never before been employed in vivo, and we would assay in the context of rescuing (some of) the phenotypes seen in OGT mutant flies. (4) The student will also attempt to rescue observed phenotypes by globally manipulating O-GlcNAc levels, genetically by knocking out OGA (which unlike in mammals is tolerated in the fly) and pharmacologically through the use of OGA inhibitors or glucosamine supplementation.

This modification is removed by a single enzyme, OGlcNAc hydrolase (OGA). Both proteins are essential for mammalian embryonic and perinatal survival, respectively. Recently, mutations in OGT have been identified as causal in intellectual disability (ID), however, the exact mechanism leading to this disorder are unknown. This studentship will endeavour to identify how two hypothesised mechanisms contribute to OGT-ID: altered O-GlcNAcylation and altered OGT:protein interactions. To achieve this the student will use Drosophila melanogaster as a model system. OGT is highly conserved from humans to Drosophila, along with many of its interactors, such as the mitochondrial motility protein Milton and periodicity proteins involved in the circadian rhythm. The student will dissect the molecular mechanisms leading to ID through achieving 4 aims. (1) The student will generate fly lines carrying OGT mutations equivalent to those found in patients using a CRISPR/Cas9 system. We have already demonstrated the viability of this approach successfully generating a fly line carrying a patient mutation. (2) These fly lines will then be assayed for a number of neuronal phenotypes, both morphological and behavioural. The former will be achieved using a combination of genetic and antibody labelling to visualize gross brain morphology, mushroom body morphology (the associative memory region of the fly brain, and an excellent model to study axonal morphology), and dendritic morphology using class IV dendritic arborisation sensory neurons. To assay neuronal function through behaviour, a light-off habituation test will be employed. This leverages the natural escape response of Drosophila to a sudden reduction in light, in nature signalling the presence of a predator, and measures their neuronal adaptation to the repetition of this stimulus without the ordinarily associated consequence. In preliminary experiments, we have found a decrease in habituation in OGT mutant flies. (3) The specific mechanisms driving the observed phenotypes will be dissected through proteomic and transcriptomic approaches. Quantitative O-GlcNAc proteomics will be conducted through enrichment of O-GlcNAcylated proteins with a catalytically inactive OGA we have used for this purpose in the past. The role of individual proteins or modified sites will be probed through genetic approaches, ablating induvial proteins to assess genetic interactions or individual modified sites by mutating modified residues to alanine. An additional approach which can be employed is the mutation of identified sites to cysteine. We have found this results in a SGlcNAc modification which is not hydrolysable by OGA, elevating the stoichiometry of the modification on a single residue. This is a technique which has never before been employed in vivo, and we would assay in the context of rescuing (some of) the phenotypes seen in OGT mutant flies. (4) The student will also attempt to rescue observed phenotypes by globally manipulating O-GlcNAc levels, genetically by knocking out OGA (which unlike in mammals is tolerated in the fly) and pharmacologically through the use of OGA inhibitors or glucosamine supplementation. All aforementioned approaches have been shown to result in elevated OGlcNAcylation. Their efficacy at rescuing phenotypes will be assayed through administration at various developmental stages providing insight into the reversibility of the ID in adult organisms. Together, this studentship will answer many fundamental questions about the role of OGT mutations in the development of ID, establish Drosophila as a model for the functional analysis of single site O-GlcNAc modifications, and guide future research we will conduct on a mammalian system.

87    Dr Pollard Steven    University of Edinburgh    2014-08-01    2015-07-31    Equipment supplement: The role of SOX and FOX genes in orchestrating transcriptional and epigenetic programs in glioblastoma    Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most devastating human cancers. There are few treatment options and median survival is only around one year. Sequence-specific transcription factors required for normal neural stem cell self-renewal are likely to play critical roles in driving unconstrained self-renewal in GBM. Particularly interesting are members of the forkhead box (FOX) and SRY-related (SOX) families, which orchestrate lineage choice, differentiation and proliferation/survival pathways in the developing nervous system. For example, there is clear evidence that FOXG1 and SOX2 cooperate to establish and sustain the neural stem cell state. Although each of these factors has been previously implicated in human GBM, we have poor mechanistic understanding of their specific functions and key downstream effectors. Aims: We will define the specific function, molecular partners and transcriptional targets of FOXG1 and SOX2 in normal human neural stem (NS) cells and GBM-derived neural stem (GNS) cells. Our hypothesis is that in GBM the increased level and/or activity of these factors restricts differentiation, locking cells into a continuous cycle of self-renewal. There are three complementary aims: 1) Test the role of SOX and FOX in establishing and sustaining GBM. 2) Determine the molecular basis of SOX2 and FOXG1 activity by defining their molecular partners and key transcriptional targets. 3) Exploit our expertise in genome editing to explore FOX and SOX gene function and create live cell reporters for drug screening. Methods: We will use primary human GBM-derived cell lines as a tractable and disease-relevant model. We have routine access to fresh tumours and a set of well-characterized GNS cell lines. Intracranial transplantation will be used to assess the malignancy of cells following perturbation of FOXG1 and SOX2. Tumour initiation will be tested by delivery of lentiviral overexpression vectors into the mouse forebrain. ChIP-seq, and immunoprecipitation mass spectometry (IP-MS) will be used to determine targets and partners, respectively. Genome editing methods (TALENs and/or CRISPR/Cas system) will be exploited to generate conditional alleles and knock-in reporters. How the results will be used: SOX2 and FOXG1 proteins are important therapeutic targets, yet we need to define their precise molecular activities to identify ‘druggable’ effectors. These might be direct protein partners within the transcriptional/chromatin regulatory complex, or downstream transcriptional targets. The SOX2 and FOXG1 reporter cell lines developed in this project will be of immense value for cell based screening for new drug discovery.

Prof. Dr. SCHOLZE Petra    Medical University of Vienna    2018-04-01    2021-03-31    Human Nicotinic Receptor Polymorphisms in Synaptic Pathology    NICO-SNP Role of human polymorphisms in nicotinic receptors in synaptic pathology This ERA-NET Neuron application is a joined project between Dr. Uwe Maskos from the Institute Pasteur in Paris, Dr. Huib Mansvelder from the Center for Neurogenomics and Cognitive Research at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam, and Dr. Petra Scholze from the Center for Brain Research, Medical University of Vienna. This consortium brings together experts in molecular and cell biology (including human induced pluripotent cells, iPS), imaging and electrophysiology, and train 3 Postdocs in biology of addiction and translation. We will be addressing five major addictions, which all depend on the brain cholinergic system. The project is based on human genetic studies that identified polymorphisms of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors predisposing to smoking. In addition, four other addictions have been linked to this locus: cocaine, alcohol, opioid and cannabis. Thus, nAChRs belong to the most promising pharmacological targets influencing addictive behavior. The main objectives of NICO-SNP are the development and characterization of animal models carrying nAChR polymorphisms; the development and characterization of human induced pluripotent cells carrying polymorphisms and the identification of molecules which can be used to treat the addiction. In Vienna we will analyze functional properties and downstream effects of nAChRs in human dopaminergic (DA) iPS cells. Particular emphasis will be laid on two types of receptors: alpha5-containing hetero-pentamers, and alpha7 homo-pentamers. With the support of the French collaboration partner DA iPS cells will be genetically manipulated using CRISPR technology in order to either express the polymorphisms alpha5-398D, alpha5-398N or no alpha5 at all. Another line of DA iPS cells will be engineered to express human alpha7, plus/minus the partial duplicated alpha7 gene, which is found in humans only (CHRFAM7A) or no alpha7. Our preferred method of analysis will be Ca++ imaging, based on the Fura-2 technique. When indicated, Ca++ imaging will be combined with patch clamp electrophysiology in order to determine fractional Ca-currents. The prime agonists for creating dose-response curves will be nicotine and ACh (in the presence of atropine), and the specificity of effects will be established by adding antagonists like DHbE, MEC or a-conotoxin MII. Where indicated, activation of alpha7 receptors will be prevented by including 5 nM MLA in the drug application system. Experiments will show the impact of alpha5D or its N variant on intracellular Ca++ transients. Prolonged exposure with low concentrations of nicotine will reveal whether the genotypes differ significantly in their desensitization properties, whether receptor upregulation is maintained in the alpha5N variant, and whether nAChR activation affects DA production and the function of GABAA receptors. Experiments will further show the functional impact of CHRFAM7A, if any.    Austrian Science Fund FWF    Sir Henry Dale Fellowship    299672.1EUR

Prof.Dr. VALENT Peter    Ludwig Boltzmann Gesellschaft    2018-02-01    2022-01-31    Impact of Age-Related Clonal Hematopoiesis on Evolution of Atherosclerosis in CML    Recent data suggest that hematopoietic ageing is associated with an accumulation of somatic mutations and that acquisition of such mutations is associated with an increased risk a) to develop a myeloid neoplasm and b) to develop life-threatening cardiovascular events. Correspondingly, the incidence of cardiovascular events increases with age and is higher in patients suffering from certain myeloid neoplasms. However, little is known about cellular interactions and molecular mechanisms contributing to cardiovascular events in these patients. One hypothesis is that clonal myeloid cells directly mediate inflammation and vascular damage and thus contribute to atherosclerosis in elderly patients. Another hypothesis is that vascular cells are in part derived from clonal pluripotent leukemic stem cells and that the acquired mutations alter endothelial cell function which in turn facilitates the occurrence of atherosclerosis. We and others have recently shown that patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treated with nilotinib or ponatinib have an increased risk to develop atherosclerosis and severe cardiovascular events. In addition, we found that nilotinib and ponatinib can directly induce alterations in the phenotype and growth properties of vascular endothelial cells. More recently, we have detected age-related somatic loss-of-function (LOF) mutations (TET2, DNMT3A, ASXL1) in patients with CML treated with nilotinib. These mutations were detected at the time of a major or complete molecular response and were found to cluster in those patients in whom a cardiovascular event was recorded during therapy. In the current project, the functional impact of age-related LOF-mutations and their distribution among hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells in CML will be investigated. In a first step, clonality of various leukocyte-subsets and microdissected endothelial cells will be determined at diagnosis and at the time of a major molecular response. Next, the effects of age-related LOF-mutations on macrophage- and endothelial cell function will be examined. The pro-atherogenic effects of LOF-mutations will be analyzed by measuring expression of pro-atherogenic receptors and mediators in endothelial cells and macrophages after CRISPR Cas9 or shRNA-mediated knock-down of TET2, DNMT3A, or ASXL1. In addition, the impact of LOF-mutations will be studied in Ldlr-/- mice crossed with LOF gene-deficient mice. In order to define early stages of pluripotent stem cells and their angiogenic potential in CML, we will generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from primary CML cells, and will explore the effects of various targeted drugs, including nilotinib, ponatinib, and lenalidomid, on differentiation of iPSC into endothelial cells and macrophages. The long term aims are to 1) identify target-pathways triggering differentiation of CML stem cells into endothelial cells and macrophages, to 2) define the pro-atherogenic and anti-angiogenic impact of LOF-mutations under drug-exposure, and to 3) identify drugs capable of interfering with stem cell differentiation into endothelial cells and macrophages and with the pro-atherogenic activity of LOF-mutations. The results of our study should contribute to a better understanding of pathogenetic factors and mechanisms underlying vascular changes in CML patients and pave the way for therapeutic strategies through which pro-atherogenic and thromboembolic events can be prevented in these patients.

Prof.Dr. MIKULITS Wolfgang    Medical University of Vienna    2019-06-03    2022-12-02    Role of Axl Receptor Shedding in Liver Cancer    Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents the major subtype of liver cancer showing the second highest cancer-related mortality worldwide. A prominent feature of HCC is the development from chronic liver diseases (CLDs) such as virally-induced hepatitis or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/steatohepatitis that occurs predominantly in the setting of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. Signalling of the receptor tyrosine kinase Axl by binding of its ligand Gas6 to the ectodomain is essentially involved in the progression of fibrosis and the development of HCC. Notably, shedding of the Axl ectodomain, resulting in soluble Axl (sAxl), provides a highly accurate biomarker for the diagnosis of advanced liver fibrosis/cirrhosis, and early to late HCC in the absence and presence of cirrhosis. These observations raise the question whether the cleavage of sAxl either (i) leads to Gas6-independing Axl signalling, or (ii) does not affect Axl signalling by abundant expression of wild type Axl together with available free Gas6, or (iii) dampens an anti-oncogenic Axl signal. In this project, we will address the role of Axl receptor shedding as a driver of liver fibrosis and HCC development by using human CRISPR/Cas9 liver models, Axl-deficient mouse models and CLD/HCC patient samples. Gas6-dependent and Gas6-independent Axl targets will be identified by RNA-Seq analysis and further examined by gain- and loss-of-functions studies in vitro and in vivo for their mechanistic impact on liver fibrosis and HCC. Moreover, a chemical compound screening will be employed to identify novel Axl treatment targets that can be exploited for the reversion of liver fibrosis and ablation of HCC. Altogether, this project will yield novel insights into Axl receptor shedding that could be used for innovative strategies to efficiently combat liver fibrosis and HCC .

94    Univ.Prof. Dr. Busslinger Meinrad Josef    Research Institute of Molecular Pathology GmbH - Vienna    2018-01-01    2022-12-31    Transcriptional control of plasma cell development and function    Antibody-secreting cells consisting of short-lived proliferating plasmablasts and long-lived quiescent plasma cells are essential for the acute response to infection and long-term protection of the host against pathogens. Only a few regulators (Blimp1, IRF4, XBP1, Aiolos, Ikaros and E-proteins) have been implicated in the transcriptional control of antibody-secreting cells, and their target genes, with the exception of Blimp1 and E-proteins, are still unknown. This proposal aims to systematically identify key players in the development and function of antibody-secreting cells by using the CRISPR/Cas9 and Cre/loxP methods. For this, we improved existing protocols to extend the duration of in vitro plasmablast differentiation and showed that Rosa26(Cas9/+) B cells infected with Blimp1 or Xbp1 sgRNA-expressing retroviruses recapitulated the Blimp1 and Xbp1 mutant phenotypes in this proof-of-principle experiment. Moreover, Cre retrovirus-mediated deletion of Irf4, Ikaros and Aiolos strongly impaired plasmablast differentiation in this optimized system. To discover new regulators of plasma cell differentiation, CRISPR/Cas9-based screens will be performed with pooled sgRNA libraries targeting all known upregulated genes in plasmablasts and plasma cells, followed by individual validation of the best hits. Selected top-ranked genes will be analyzed in vivo by conditional mutagenesis with newly generated, plasma cell-specific Cre lines. Regulated target genes of IRF4, Ikaros, Aiolos, XBP1 and the XBP1-regulated transcription factor Bhlha15 will be identified in plasmablasts by ChIP- and RNA-seq analyses. Target genes with potentially interesting functions will be further characterized by CRISPR/Cas9- or Cre/loxP-mediated mutagenesis. These experiments will provide fundamentally new insight into the molecular mechanisms controlling the development and function of antibody-secreting cells, which are the essential effector cells of humoral immunity.

95    Prof. SUPERTI-FURGA Giulio    Cemm- Center For Molecular Medicine Of The Austrian Academy Of Sciences    2016-06-01    2019-05-31    The viral transportome (ViTra)    The ViTra (Viral Transportome) research proposal investigates the possibility that in host cells, viruses regulate members of the solute carrier of transport proteins (SLCs) to tweak the metabolic state to their advantage. The study will offer important insights into the function of SLCs, most of which are poorly characterized, and is expected to shed light into the intertwining of metabolism and signaling and, potentially, open up possibilities to stop viruses by starving them of key building blocks. Both research areas, viral-host interactions and solute carrier proteins, are increasingly becoming the object of significant research efforts from the scientific community. At the same time, it would be inappropriate to consider them mainstream yet. Research on solute carrier proteins has traditionally been focused on individual proteins and individual transport phenomena and it is only through relatively recent efforts of pioneering individuals and initiatives that over-arching themes and connections are becoming apparent. We aim to characterize the role of host SLCs in the viral life cycle as well as confirm their function as a new regulatory group of proteins in the antiviral immune response. Upon integration of the multiple large-scale datasets from recent genome-wide screens, a group of 20 SLC proteins has been identified to have a function linked to viral replication or immune response. We will systematically inactivate the genes encoding these SLCs using CRISPR/Cas9 technology in the haploid human cell line HAP1 and screen for the effect of these mutations on the susceptibility of the cells to virus infection. Moreover, we will study the protein-protein interactions of the most interesting candidates and will try to deduce, through metabolomics and bioinformatics approaches, the natural cargo that may be critical during the viral life-cycle. Together, this “viral transportome” will offer new insights into possible strategies to pharmacologically interfere with viral infections. We are seeking support for one postdoctoral fellow and a 50% time commitment from a technical assistant in order to complete this proposal. They will complement the efforts currently made by PhD student Anna Moskovskich, who generated the SLC KO lines and is already involved in setting up the primary and secondary screens with several viruses. We will work closely with Keiryn Bennett, the group leader of the CeMM Proteomics facility and a world-renowned mass spectometrist, who will help and assist with the proteomics and metabolomics aims of the project. Moreover, this proposal will also benefit from collaborations with Douglas Kell (University of Manchester, UK) and Matthias Hediger (University of Bern, CH) and from the virology expertise of Gijs Versteeg (MFPL, AT) and Franz Heinz (MUW, AT).

They are the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in the young through ventricular arrhythmias and also contribute substantially to heart failure, putting a major burden on health care systems. To develop specific therapies, it is necessary to understand the consequences of the genetic mutations at the molecular level. Model systems, such as cells, organoids and whole organisms are used to elucidate disease pathways. The animal models among them have a high ethical burden, therefore there is a need to replace them by cellular models. Induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM) have emerged as a novel model system to study inherited heart conditions and thereby provide an opportunity to replace animal models, especially mice, to study these genetic diseases. The advantage of the iPSC-CM system is their human physiology (e.g. beating rates and ion channel setups) and that genetic mutations can be introduced via CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome-editing. However, immaturity of iPSCCM proves a major obstacle in their utilisation, but novel 3D culturing methods such as engineered heart tissue (EHT) have been shown to result in more mature characteristics of iPSC-CM. Titin truncation variants (TTNtv) are found in up to 25 % of patients suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy, one of the major inherited cardiac conditions. There is an increased burden of ventricular arrhythmias in these patients as well as a link of TTNtv and atrial fibrillation (a form of atrial arrhythmia), indicating that TTNtv can predispose to arrhythmias in both settings. The main scientific objective of the project is to develop iPSC-CM derived cellular model systems (both 2D and 3D) to study the predisposition to atrial and ventricular arrhythmias caused by mutations in cardiac genes.

97    Dr Davies James    University of Oxford    2018-02-20    2022-02-19    Development of highly sensitive methods for defining off target mutations to enable safe gene editing of haematopoietic cells for transplantation    Inherited cardiac conditions are caused by genetic mutations in cardiac genes. They are the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in the young through ventricular arrhythmias and also contribute substantially to heart failure, putting a major burden on health care systems. To develop specific therapies, it is necessary to understand the consequences of the genetic mutations at the molecular level. Model systems, such as cells, organoids and whole organisms are used to elucidate disease pathways. The animal models among them have a high ethical burden, therefore there is a need to replace them by cellular models. Induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM) have emerged as a novel model system to study inherited heart conditions and thereby provide an opportunity to replace animal models, especially mice, to study these genetic diseases. The advantage of the iPSC-CM system is their human physiology (e.g. beating rates and ion channel setups) and that genetic mutations can be introduced via CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome-editing. However, immaturity of iPSCCM proves a major obstacle in their utilisation, but novel 3D culturing methods such as engineered heart tissue (EHT) have been shown to result in more mature characteristics of iPSC-CM.

98    Dr Bergen Dylan    University of Bristol    2019-04-01    2022-03-21    Determining new osteo-anabolic targets using zebrafish models of human genomic study discoveries    Over 3-million people in the UK have osteoporosis and suffer bone fragility due to an altered balance of bone-building osteoblast and bone-resorbing osteoclast activity. Most available therapies are anti-resorptive, targeting osteoclasts which halt bone loss, rather than building new bone. Osteo-anabolic treatments are few; new compounds are needed as our population ages and fracture numbers rise. I will exploit the rich genetic learning from two unique studies to identify novel bone regulatory pathways, amenable to therapeutic manipulation for treating osteoporosis. The evolutionarily conserved zebrafish model allows quick screening of osteo-anabolic target genes by combining efficient CRISPR-Cas9 genome-engineering, rapid skeletal development and translucency; enabling skeletal imaging with fluorescent transgenic lines. I will use the latest data from (1) UK-Biobank genome wide association study of bone mineral density (BMD) and (2) whole-exome sequencing analysis of 22 pedigrees with unexplained monogenic high bone-mass (HBM), two unique datasets which together have identified hundreds of potential novel osteo-anabolic genes. I will deploy my newly developed in-silico prioritisation pipeline to objectively select genes for functional investigation in zebrafish. Preliminary in-silico prioritisation identified DOT1L histone-H3 methyltransferase as a novel BMD factor and proof-of-concept data demonstrated a HBM phenotype in dot1l mutant zebrafish. The efficient CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing protocol will in addition generate loss-of-function mutants of several prioritised genes. These mutants will be imaged for osteoblast number, skeletal development and morphology. I will learn and deploy state-of-the-art methods to ex-vivo culture of adult zebrafish scales, containing dermal bone decorated with osteoblasts and osteoclasts. This new approach will allow investigation of responses to compounds hypothesised to affect prioritised osteo-anabolic targets and enable compound screening in a gene-specific setting. This exciting high-impact collaborative research will launch my independent scientific career, focussing on osteoblast biology in-vivo, compounds for osteo-anabolic pharmacotherapies, aiming to generate cutting-edge pre-clinical data to inform future drug trials.

Recently the concept of synthetic rescue has emerged to ameliorate pathologies that occur in rare diseases. Our hypothesis is synthetic rescue interactions can be identified and utilized to alleviate rare diseases resulting from defects in the DNA repair pathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER). Thus, we have generated loss-of-function mutations for four rare diseases associated with defective NER. Next, using insertional mutagenesis, CRISPR libraries and drug/compound screening we will systematically identify the combinatorial loss of the second gene/target that results in synthetic rescue. Patient cells will be used for confirmation studies. Next we shall elucidate the mode of action for the synthetic viable interactions, hence catalyzing the discovery of new treatments for these debilitating diseases.

Tight control of alternative splicing is very important as evidenced by linkage of abnormal alternative splicing with numerous human diseases including cancer. Exon skipping/inclusion is the major alternative splicing event in human, therefore genome-wide studies of cancer-associated alternative splicing have been well focused on detection and characterization of this type of event. Recently, we have discovered unusual alternative splicing that we termed exitron (exonic intron) splicing. Exitrons are internal regions of protein-coding exons and have features of both exons and introns. Exitron splicing results in protein isoforms with altered sequences and often affects protein domains and various post-translational modification sites. Strikingly, at least 3.7% of human protein-coding genes contain exitrons as evidenced by analyses of seven tissue and one breast cancer transcriptomes. Here we propose a project based on our findings that 1) exitron splicing involves genes with reported functions in cancer; 2) exitron splicing broadly affects features of proteins encoded by cancer-related genes; 3) mutations affect exitron splicing in cancer-associated genes; and 4) ~9% of exitron splicing events are misregulated in breast cancer involving genes with implicated functions in cancer. We aim to elucidate a link between exitron splicing and cancer so far never explored in different cancer types. To this end, we will identify misregulated exitron splicing events in various solid tumours by using publicly available RNA-seq datasets. We will use RT-PCR and Lariat-seq, extensive sequencing of splicing-derived lariat RNAs, to validate exitron splicing. We will examine functional relevance of misregulated exitrons regarding their effects on protein isoform features. We will test impact of misregulated exitron-retained/spliced isoforms using siRNA/CRISPR-mediated knockdown/outs together with various functional assays. We are interested to elucidate basis of exitron splicing regulation. The unique feature of exitrons as intra-exonic sequences implies specific recognition mechanism and requirements for regulating their splicing. Hence, we will investigate splicing regulatory elements and splicing factors implicated in exitron splicing. We assume that exitron splicing takes place on mature spliced mRNA via mRNA re-splicing, and we will examine this hypothesis. Taken together, this project will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of alternative splicing. Identified set of exitron splicing events will complement the repertoire of the known alternative splicing events misregulated in cancer and may lead to the development of novel cancer markers and/or therapeutic targets.

They are the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in the young through ventricular arrhythmias and also contribute substantially to heart failure, putting a major burden on health care systems. To develop specific therapies, it is necessary to understand the consequences of the genetic mutations at the molecular level. Model systems, such as cells, organoids and whole organisms are used to elucidate disease pathways. The animal models among them have a high ethical burden, therefore there is a need to replace them by cellular models. Induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM) have emerged as a novel model system to study inherited heart conditions and thereby provide an opportunity to replace animal models, especially mice, to study these genetic diseases. The advantage of the iPSC-CM system is their human physiology (e.g. beating rates and ion channel setups) and that genetic mutations can be introduced via CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome-editing. However, immaturity of iPSC-CM proves a major obstacle in their utilisation, but novel 3D culturing methods such as engineered heart tissue (EHT) have been shown to result in more mature characteristics of iPSC-CM. Titin truncation variants (TTNtv) are found in up to 25 % of patients suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy, one of the major inherited cardiac conditions. There is an increased burden of ventricular arrhythmias in these patients as well as a link of TTNtv and atrial fibrillation (a form of atrial arrhythmia), indicating that TTNtv can predispose to arrhythmias in both settings. The main scientific objective of the project is to develop iPSC-CM derived cellular model systems (both 2D and 3D) to study the predisposition to atrial and ventricular arrhythmias caused by mutations in cardiac genes. This will provide an alternative to in vivo mouse models commonly used, which can be highly invasive. TTNtv, linked to ventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation in humans, will be used as example mutations. Specific aims of the project are: 1.) Introduction of two pathogenic TTNtv into iPSC, done in collaboration with Prof C Denning (University of Nottingham), using optimised genome-editing protocols. 2.) Development of protocols to differentiate Kolf2 iPSC into ventricular and atrial iPSC-CM While differentiation into ventricular iPSC-CM is established in the lab, differentiation protocols for atrial iPSC-CM using retinoic acid will be established. 3.) Generation of EHT from atrial and ventricular iPSC-CM Generation of ventricular EHT is established in the lab, however atrial EHT is a novel approach to be established. Enhanced maturity of both ventricular and atrial EHT will be documented by comparison to 2D cultures of the same iPSC-CM (atrial/ventricular). 4.) Characterisation of electric disturbances in iPSC-CM in the presence of TTNtv 2D cultures of atrial and ventricular iPSC-CM with and without TTNtv will be assessed using optical mapping, multi-electrode arrays and measurements of calcium transients. Spontaneous electric activity of atrial and ventricular EHTs will be assessed by optical mapping. Challenge experiments will apply arrhythmia-inducing drugs to provoke or enhance arrhythmic behaviour. The work of aims 2 to 4 will be carried out at the University of Birmingham (UoB), guided by Dr. K Gehmlich and Prof P Kirchhof. 5.) Modelling of electric disturbances Under guidance by Prof B Rodriguez (University of Oxford), computational modelling will provide insight into underlying molecular changes responsible for arrhythmic behaviour. Identified targets will be validated by biochemical and electrophysiological methods. By the end of the project the student will have a thorough understanding which arrhythmic aspects of TTNtv can be modelled in iPSC-CM derived cellular systems and how computational modelling can aide the experimental work.

107    Dr. HANNA Yaqub    Weizmann Institute    2017-11-01    2022-10-31    Deciphering the Molecular Foundations and Functional Competence of Alternative Human Naïve Pluripotent Stem Cells    An important goal of stem cell therapy is to create “customized” cells that are genetically identical to the patient, which upon transplantation can restore damaged tissues. Such cells can be obtained by in vitro direct reprogramming of somatic cells into embryonic stem (ES)-like cells, termed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). This approach also opens possibilities for modelling human diseases in vitro. However, major hurdles remain that restrain fulfilling conventional human iPSC/ESC potential, as they reside in an advanced primed pluripotent state. Such hurdles include limited differentiation capacity and functional variability. Further, in vitro iPSC based research platforms are simplistic and iPSC based “humanized” chimeric mouse models may be of great benefit. The recent isolation of distinct and new “mouse-like” naive pluripotent states in humans that correspond to earlier embryonic developmental state(s), constitutes a paradigm shift and may alleviate limitations of conventional primed iPSCs/ESCs. Thus, our proposal aims at dissecting the human naïve pluripotent state(s) and to unveil pathways that facilitate their unique identity and flexible programming. Specific goals: 1) Transcriptional and Epigenetic Design Principles of Human Naïve Pluripotency 2) Signalling Principles Governing Human Naïve Pluripotency Maintenance and Differentiation 3) Defining Functional Competence and Safety of Human Naïve Pluripotent Stem Cells in vitro 4) Novel human naïve iPSC based cross-species chimeric mice for studying human differentiation and disease modelling in vivo. These aims will be conducted by utilizing engineered human iPSC/ESC models, CRISPR/Cas9 genome-wide screening, advanced microscopy and ex-vivo whole embryo culture methods. Our goals will synergistically lead to the design of strategies that will accelerate the safe medical application of human naive pluripotent stem cells and their use in disease specific modelling and applied stem cell research.

108    Dr. HANNA Yaqub    University of Basel    2016-04-01    2019-03-31    Testing predictions of Red Queen coevolution    Testing predictions of Red Queen coevolutionDieter Ebert, Universität BaselSUMMARYIt is believed that many biological phenomena (e.g. the evolution of sex, Batesian mimicry, and immune response) have evolved as a consequence of host-parasite coevolution. The leading hypothesis for such coevolution is based on time-lagged negative frequency dependent selection (NFDS), also known as Red Queen coevolution. Evidence from population genetics (e.g. high genetic diversity and balancing selection at disease loci) is consistent with the idea that NFDS drives coevolution in host-parasite systems, but other models of coevolution (e.g., selective sweeps) cannot be easily excluded. Here I propose to test the predictions of the Red Queen coevolution hypothesis by analysis of hosts and parasite dynamics in one well-characterized population. In this Daphnia magna population we observe yearly strong epidemics of the bacterial parasite Pasteuria ramosa. I propose to test the hypothesis that coevolution in this system is driven by NFDS. Subproject A aims to identify the host genes that prevent parasite attachment in one particular population (“The Swisspond”), which has yearly strong epidemics of Pasteuria ramosa. We plan to compare different host-genotypes by sequencing from each resistotype multiple genomes and conduct genome-wide association mapping. In a next step we aim to pinpoint the exact genes responsible for the resistance polymorphism by employing molecular tools (CRISPR/Cas9) to knock down candidate genes in the regions of interest. The cloned offspring of the knock down genotypes will be tested for phenotypic effects in response to multiple parasite clones.Subproject B continues our efforts to find the infectivity genes in the bacterial pathogen Pasteuria. This parasite has now been fully sequenced and genomes from different isolates with known infection characteristics will be compared. As a further step we plan to do a proteomics approach, to identify the proteins which are expressed on the spore surface and which are responsible for the attachment of the parasite to the host. Subproject C aims to uncover the genetic interaction matrix between host and parasite genotypes. Host and parasite isolates from the field will be cloned in the laboratory and the mode of inheritance of resistance will be worked out by conducting genetic crosses among hosts. At the same time, infected hosts will be collected across the course of an epidemic in the field and will be genotypes for candidate genes at host resistance loci and parasite infectivity loci. This “co-genotyping” will allow estimating the strength of genetic host-parasite interactions during natural epidemics and enable us to estimate the strength of selection acting on different genotypes. Expected value of the research: This research aims to provide a convincing case study on the validity and predictions of the Red Queen coevolution hypothesis, offering urgently needed genetic data for theoretical and empirical research in evolution, epidemiology and disease biology. It has implications for our understanding of how coevolution shapes genetic diversity and genomes.    Swiss National Science Foundation    Project funding (Div. I-III)    834000.0CHF
109    Dr. HANNA Yaqub    University of Berne    2015-10-01    2018-09-30    Quality control of gene expression: towards understanding mechanism and physiological role of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD)    The term “Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay” (NMD) was originally coined to describe a translation-dependent process that degrades mRNAs with truncated open reading frames (ORFs). By recognizing and degrading mRNAs with premature termination codons (PTCs), many of which arise by alternative splicing, NMD serves as a quality control of gene expression and protects the cell from accumulating C-terminally truncated proteins with potentially toxic functions. However, a more general role of NMD in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression emerged from transcriptome-wide mRNA profilings that identified many physiological (i.e. PTC-free) mRNAs as NMD targets, overall affecting the mRNA levels of 3 - 10% of all genes in yeast, Drosophila, and human cells. NMD is essential in vertebrates and an important modulator of genetic disease phenotypes in humans, since 30% of all known disease-causing mutations are predicted to trigger NMD.Over the past 10 years, our lab has contributed both to the dissection of the molecular mechanism of NMD as well as to a better understanding of the biological function of NMD in mammalian cells. With the projects proposed here, we aim at continuing our research along these two lines by using a combination of biochemical, molecular biology, cell biology and reverse genetics methods. We plan to generate several inducible pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines with mutations in various NMD factors and assess their effect on the transcriptome and the capability of the cells to differentiate. The mutations will be introduced using recently developed genome-editing techniques (CRISPR/Cas). Compared to traditional knockdown-rescue experiments, the genome editing approach has the advantage that the effect of the mutant proteins can be assessed in the absence of any remaining low levels of WT protein possibly confounding the phenotype. On the biochemical side, one of our main goals is to establish a protocol to purify specific messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) populations that have been arrested at different stages along the NMD pathway and characterizing their composition by mass spectrometry. This will give us important insight into mRNP remodeling events during NMD. A third line of research concerns a follow-up of our recent finding that NMD appears to play a role in defending cells from RNA virus replication. We want to find out what makes the Semliki Forest Virus genomic RNA an NMD substrate and test other viruses for their sensitivity to NMD.Collectively, our research aims at understanding the molecular mechanism of NMD and its physiological role in human cells. This is the basis for the future development of highly specific approaches to manipulate in a controlled way NMD activity in different disease contexts.

110    Ao. Prof. Dr. MARTENS Sascha    University of Vienna    2015-06-01    2018-05-31    On the role of the Atg11 homology domain during selective autophagy    Autophagy is an intracellular process that mediates the bulk degradation of cellular material. During autophagy double membrane-bound vesicles called autophagosomes are formed de novo. Autophagosomes initially appear as small membrane structures called isolation membranes that gradually expand and thereby sequester cellular material. After their formation autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes (in complex eukaryotes) or the vacuole (in yeast) wherein the cargo is degraded. Autophagy thereby protects cells and thus the organism from various stresses including periods of starvation, protein aggregates, intracellular pathogens and damaged organelles. Consequently autophagy has been linked to various human diseases. It is becoming increasingly clear that autophagy can be highly selective with regard to the cargo that is captures within autophagosomes. Cargo receptor proteins specifically bind the cargo link it to the autophagic machinery via their interaction with scaffold proteins. In this proposal we will focus on the conserved Atg11-homology domain in the S. cerevisiae scaffold protein Atg11 and the human FIP200 protein. S. cerevisiae Atg11 interacts with the Atg19 cargo receptor and our preliminary results show that human FIP200 interacts with the p62 cargo receptor. Both interactions are mediated by the C-terminal Atg11 homology domain in the Atg11 and FIP200 scaffold proteins, respectively. Using biochemistry we will fine map these interactions and determine the structure of the Atg11-homology domain by X-ray crystallography. The biochemical and structural results will be tested in reconstitution systems employing cell lysates from CRISPR/Cas9 genome edited human cells and in assays for selective autophagy in S. cerevisiae and human cells lines. The experiments proposed here will yield fascinating insights into the coupling of selective autophagy cargo to the autophagic machinery. The cargo receptors and autophagic scaffold proteins are playing key roles and our experiments will help to unravel the mechanisms underlying this important process.

In particular, mirroring their unparalleled morphological and cellular complexity, vertebrate brains show the highest levels of regulated AS known in nature. However, the functions of most of these alternative transcripts, and the evolutionary impact that the increased transcriptional complexity has had on the evolution of the vertebrate brain are still widely unexplored. In this project, we will investigate the functions and evolutionary impact of neural AS in vertebrates. We will focus on neural-specific alternative exons that are highly conserved across vertebrate groups (suggesting functional importance), but that are not conserved in invertebrates, and are thus vertebrate-specific genomic novelties. We will term these exons Vertebrate- and Neural-specific Alternatively Spliced (VN-AS) exons. Through a combination of bioinformatics, experimental manipulation in models species, and systems-level network analysis, we aim to: (i) Comprehensively identify VN-AS exons, and study their regulation during vertebrate neurogenesis and nervous system development, using RNA-seq and comparative genomics; (ii) Probe the phenotypic impact of VN-AS exons on vertebrate nervous systems, using the CRISPR-Cas technology for genome editing; and (iii) Investigate how VN-AS exons rewire protein-protein interaction networks in vertebrate neurons - an emergent molecular function for AS -, and whether this rewiring underlies novel functions of VN-AS exons in the vertebrate brains. This project will thus deliver fundamental insight into two major unanswered questions: (i) what are the functions of transcriptomic diversification, and (ii) how does transcriptomic diversification impact organismal evolution. Our results will fill a large gap of knowledge in our current understanding of brain evolution and development, providing a complementary angle to traditional gene expression studies.

My proposed research aims to advance our understanding of the mechanisms of cell competition and how it impacts on adult tissue biology, to advance our fundamental understanding of this biomedically-relevant process and learn how to harness it for therapeutics. Building on my group’s recent discoveries and methodological advances, I will use an integrated strategy combining in vitro and in vivo approaches to: 1) Elucidate how the oxidative stress response, which we found marks cells as ‘losers’ for competitive elimination, triggers cell competition in Drosophila. 2) Elucidate another link we discovered between aberrant autophagy in ‘loser’ cells and cell competition, in Drosophila. 3) Characterize the molecular mechanisms behind our discovery of p53-induced cell competition, using a CRISPR-based genomic screen in mammalian cultured cells. 4) Investigate the impact of cell competition on human adult tissue biology, using human primary keratinocytes and p53 competition-inducing mutations. 5) Carry out targeted proof-of-principle experiments to investigate for the first time whether cell competition can be exploited to improve tissue engraftment and repopulation in vivo, using the mouse airway.

115    Professor Vormoor Josef    Newcastle University    2017-01-01    2021-12-31    Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia - targeting novel mechanisms of clonal survival and expansion    Background: Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy in children and adolescents and, despite its high cure rate, remains one of the major causes of cancer-related and overall childhood deaths. Moreover, 2 – 3 years of chemotherapy are associated with significant morbidity and rare but potentially life-changing long-term toxicity, necessitating the need for more effective and less toxic therapies. Aims: The vision for this programme is to develop rationally designed, small molecule-based combination therapies for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: combinations that are highly active, non-toxic and prevent the emergence of resistant subclones. Methods: These combinations will be based on: • Targeted therapies that we are currently taking into early phase clinical trials in children with relapsed ALL (e.g. MEK and BCL2 inhibition) • Hypotheses-driven approaches (e.g. reactivation of p53, a key mediator of negative selection in normal B cell development) • Functional CRISPR screens in patient-derived cells to identify synthetic vulnerabilities in the context of exposure to targeted therapies • The identification of therapeutic targets through genome-wide CRISPR screens and the analysis of leukaemia-specific gene splicing Genome-wide CRISPR screening in the context of targeted therapies offers a step change in our ability to interrogate pathway dependencies and to select the most suitable inhibitors for effective combination therapies. Unbiased CRISPR screening in patient-derived cells and the analysis of plant homeodomain finger protein 5A (PHF5A)-mediated RNA splicing will determine the key drivers of the malignant phenotype in ALL. Our screens will identify opportunities for repurposing drugs already in clinical development and provide new targets for drug discovery. Most importantly, they will inform the translational/preclinical component of our programme in which we will test novel combination therapies using patient-derived cells in clinically relevant ex vivo and in vivo models. How the results of this research will be used: Our programme will generate robust preclinical data for novel combination therapies, based on mechanistic hypotheses and unbiased screening approaches, as the basis for innovative early phase clinical trials.

General aim To interrogate the role of V(D)J recombination defects in Common Variable Immunodeficiency Disorders Background The Common Variable Immunodeficiency disorders (CVIDs) comprise a group of heterogeneous primary antibody deficiencies and form the most clinically significant antibody failure in adults and children. For the majority of CVID patients the condition is sporadic, heterogeneous and polygenic. We have applied whole genome sequencing techniques to a small cohort of spor adic CVID patients in order to develop analysis pipelines for studying this cohort. Our preliminary findings reveal multiple variants in the DNA repair pathway, in particular the V(D)J recombination associated genes. Specific aims 1 To use next generation sequencing techniques to identify V(D)J recombination defects on CVID patients. 2 To establish a causative link by mimicking identified defects in fibroblast cell lines using the CRISPR-Cas9 system and studying the functional effect, by analysing expression and radiosensitivity using the gH2AX assay. 3 To link the genetic and functional defects back to the clinical phenotype. Significance The expected outcome is the identification of a subgroup of CVID patients with defects in V(D)J recombination explaining their complex phenotype. This will lead to better stratification, earlier diagnosis and potential new treatments targeting the DNA repair pathway.    Wellcome Trust    Seed Award in Science    97324.0GBP
117    Dr Patel Smita    Queen's University of Belfast    2019-10-01    2022-09-30    Development of novel models of kidney damage using induced human pluripotent stem cells    Animal models play a central role in the study of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Researchers have used mice and rats to model kidney damage seen in human patients with diabetes, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, lupus and fibrosis injury. Although many useful gene and protein targets have emerged from these studies, rodent models are limited for a number of reasons. One is the ethical issues around the numbers of mice in particular that are needed to generate gene knockouts, particularly tissue-specific knockouts (usually in the 100s-1000s). A second limitation is the fact that mice and rat models do not faithfully recapitulate the disease phenotype seen in the human kidney. For example, the most commonly used genetic strain of mice, C57Bl/6, are resistant to diabetes-induced kidney damage. Many gene and proteins that have been identified in rodent models have failed to materialise as bona fide targets when tested in humans. These limitations have led to a growing frustration in academia and industry, and led to the drive to improve our models of CKD. We propose to establish a new model of kidney injury based on 3D organoids derived from human iPS cells. Our protocol of differentiation triggers the formation of both glomerular and tubular epithelial cells that form themselves into glomerular-like and tubule-like structures (Fig. 2). These organoids will form the basis of the three interrelated project aims, which will use cell biology, microscopy and single cell sequencing to interrogate the genetic profile of the kidney organoid cells (Aim 1). We will then establish a range of new models of CKD exposing organoids to high glucose and other important drivers of kidney disease to induce damage. Cutting-edge single cell sequencing using the 10 x Genomics platform (https://www.10xgenomics.com) will be applied in-house to interrogate the genetic profiles of each of the different kidney-like cells in 3D organoids in normal versus disease conditions. The sequencing data obtained from the various organoid damage models will then be compared to existing datasets from previously used rodent models of disease available on the GEO bioinformatics platform (e.g. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/GDSbrowser?acc=GDS3990). The critical role of Gremlin1 in organoid formation and response to fibrotic insult will be tested using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Successful completion of this project will achieve a number of scientific objectives. The first is the development of a next generation cell culture organoid model of kidney injury and CKD. The development of 3D organoid models is a common direction of travel in many fields, as the limitations of studying individual cells in isolation are becoming increasingly evident. A major outcome from this proposal will be reduction potential under the NC3Rs framework. Given the numbers of mice used for CKD experiments each year (estimated at approximately 68,000 in 2016, Fig. 1), and the moderate/severe grading of many of these experiments, we believe there is exciting potential to reduce these numbers in the future. Another significant deliverable will be the use of human iPS cells to generate the kidney organoids, which will represent a translationally relevant model of human kidney disease. The potential to modify the ES cells at the gene level using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing will allow researchers to interrogate the role of their gene of interest not only in kidney development, but also in kidney cell responses to disease insults in a 3D organoid. We will use our networks such as the European Renal Cell Study Group (ERSCG) in the UK, Europe and the US to promote the potential of the organoid model as an alternative to rodent models of CKD. Dissemination of our results at national meetings such as the UK Kidney Week and the American Society of Nephrology will maximise the potential of widespread uptake and create exciting added value for the project.

118    Professor Santocanale Corrado    National University Of Ireland, Galway    2016-02-01    2019-01-31    Cellular responses to ATP competitive CDC7 kinase inhibitors    CDC7 kinase is considered a key switch for DNA replication and its depletion by siRNA causes cancer cells to stop DNA synthesis and to die in a p53 independent manner. Many institutions are developing CDC7 inhibitors (CDC7i), which block its enzymatic activity by competing with ATP, as potential agents for refractory p53 deficient cancers. Some CDC7i have excellent antitumor activity, especially in breast cancer models, and are approaching clinical trials. On the contrary, others compounds equally able to inhibit CDC7, only have marginal effect on DNA synthesis and proliferation. Such striking differences in cellular responses to CDC7 inhibition can be due to 1) off-target effects of siRNA and drugs 2) differences between protein depletion and inhibition of its kinase activity and 3) existence of mechanisms that can compensate for loss of CDC7 activity. Aims The overarching question is “How do breast cancer cells respond to CDC7 kinase inhibition and what are the genetic determinants that affect response?” Specific objectives are: 1) Develop genetic cellular models that will unequivocally allow characterization of cellular phenotypes associated with rapid and specific inhibition of CDC7. 2) Identify cellular factors that modulate the response to CDC7i. Techniques and Methodology 1) Exploiting the concept of the “analogue sensitive kinase”, we will generate cellular models in which CDC7 activity can be rapidly and efficiently modulated, with minimal off-target effects. This will be accomplished using CRISPR/CAS9 gene editing technology. 2) Using lentivirus sgRNA pooled libraries, we will perform large-scale loss-of function screens to identify cellular factors that increase the efficacy of CDC7i. Impact on breast cancer research This work will validate the use of CDC7i in breast cancer indicating which genes are involved in determining the sensitivity to CDC7i and it will advance understanding of cell-cycle regulation.

119    Dr Mullan Paul    Queen's University Belfast    2015-05-11    2018-11-01    Exploiting the TBX2 repression of CST6 as a novel treatment strategy for poor prognosis breast cancers.    TBX2 is an oncogenic transcription factor known to drive breast cancer proliferation. We have identified Cystatin 6 (CST6) as a consistently repressed TBX2 target. CST6 is a proposed tumour suppressor gene (TSG) and expression of CST6 in TBX2-expressing breast cancer cells induced apoptosis whilst non-tumorigenic breast cells remained unaffected. Functionally, CST6 is a protease inhibitor with extremely high affinity for the cancer-associated enzyme Legumain (LGMN). We have developed a series of small compound LGMN inhibitors (LGMNi's) which selectively kill TBX2/LGMN expressing breast cancer cell lines. Aims To define the TBX2 transcriptional repression complex To characterise TBX2/KAP1/HP1 epigenetic events in breast cancers To develop genetic screens of CST6 biology and LGMNi responses Techniques and Methodology Aim 1: Cell signalling methodologies (RqPCR, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, apoptosis/senescence assays, cell cycle analyses) will investigate the cellular effects of CST6 knockdown in non-tumorigenic cells. Lentiviral generation of CST6-promoter luciferase reporter cell lines and esiRNA screens will be used to identify epigenetic events occurring at the CST6 promoter. Aim 2: ChIP-seq for TBX2 and known interactors (HP1,KAP1) and DNA Methylation array analyses will be overlapped with a TBX2 microarray differential genelist to identify markers (e.g. CST6) co-ordinately regulated by this complex and pyrosequencing will validate candidate methylated genomic regions. Aim 3: Genome-wide screening using a CRISPR (GeCKO) library to look for (i) events promoting emergence of CST6-deficient breast cancers, and (ii) genes whose loss-of-function contributes to resistance to LGMNi's. Both screens will be validated in vitro (si/shRNA) and in vivo modelling (orthotopic implantation of luciferase-labelled lines) used to evaluate efficacy of LGMNi's using IVIS. Post mortem examination of mice will test utilities of selected PD biomarkers for LGMNi's. Impact on breast cancer research This proposal highlights a novel breast cancer pathway linked to poor outcomes which we will target with new anti-cancer (LGMNi) drugs.

121    Dr Bakal Chris    Institute of Cancer Research    2016-07-01    2022-06-30    Understanding how Rho GTP Exchange Factors regulate the cell shape changes underpinning breast cancer metastasis    Background Cancer metastasis is the cause of death for the vast majority of breast cancer patients. The metastatic spread of cancer cells throughout the body is absolutely dependent on the ability of cancer cells to change their shape – such as during tissue invasion, intravasation, and extravasation. Many of the cell shape changes that drive metastasis can be promoted by signals in the tumour microenvironment, including the stiffness of the tissue, and inflammation. Rho GTP Exchange Factors (RhoGEFs) are conserved regulators of cell shape that are activated by microenvironmental factors and play critical role in metastasis. In a series of previously performed genetic screens we have identified 14 RhoGEFs that we hypothesise promote the cell shape changes that underpin breast cancer metastasis in response to tissue stiffness and/or inflammation. The identification of these RhoGEFs opens up new avenues for the development of anti-metastatic therapeutics, but their role in regulating cell shape must be further characterised before they can be considered bona fide targets for manipulation in cancer cells. In particular, it is important to understand: if these RhoGEFs regulate cell shape in 3D environments with similar stiffness and geometry as tumour cells would encounter in vivo; which are the key downstream effectors of these RhoGEFs that mediate the effects of RhoGEF activation; how these RhoGEFs act to regulate downstream signalling dynamics to control cell shape; whether inhibition of these RhoGEFs affects metastasis in vivo. Aims and Methods: 1) Determine whether the 14 RhoGEFs we have identified in previous screens regulate cell shape and migration/invasion by using quantitative analysis of single cell shape following depletion of each RhoGEF in cells cultured in 3D collagen matrices of differing stiffness. 2) Identify the signalling effectors for all 14 RhoGEFs using novel computational analysis of in-house and publicly available datasets. 3) For selected RhoGEFs determine how these RhoGEFs regulate downstream signalling dynamics in single cells using novel quantitative reporters. 4) Validate whether the activity of selected RhoGEFs contributes to metastasis in vivo using CRISPR mediated knockdown in mouse models. We will also determine how RhoGEFs regulate downstream signalling activity in vivo. How the results of this research will be used: This work will describe the biochemical pathways that activated by RhoGEFs to regulate the morphogenesis, and thus provide the basis for the development of anti-metastatic therapies.

Recently the concept of synthetic rescue has emerged to ameliorate pathologies that occur in rare diseases. Our hypothesis is synthetic rescue interactions can be identified and utilized to alleviate rare diseases resulting from defects in the DNA repair pathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER). Thus, we have generated loss-of-function mutations for four rare diseases associated with defective NER. Next, using insertional mutagenesis, CRISPR libraries and drug/compound screening we will systematically identify the combinatorial loss of the second gene/target that results in synthetic rescue. Patient cells will be used for confirmation studies.

My 2018 publications in European Heart Journal and Circulation Research showed HCM could be phenocopied by a set of 11 isogenic CRISPR/Cas9 variants of the MYH7 gene (beta myosin heavy chain) of human pluripotent stem cell-cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs). Twelve different phenotyping methods were used to interrogate the generated human cell lines, often showing contradictory results relative to animal models. Importantly, a cohort of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) potentially linked to HCM was identified by RNA sequencing. This collection of cell resources, underpinning technologies and putative lncRNA pathway controllers form the basis of this proposal. Hypothesis and plans: I hypothesise that unveiling the function of these novel lncRNAs will provide new mechanisms and drug targets for HCM. To test this hypothesis, I propose to modulate the expression of these lncRNAs in hPSC-CMs by harnessing the dead Cas9 technology. I will then assess the phenotype of up/down-regulating these lncRNAs in the context of HCM, by employing the methodologies previously developed (molecular and functional assays). This will enable determining the role of lncRNAs in HCM - either as disease-causing or cardioprotective per se, or as gene modifiers regulating the primary disease effects caused by the structural defect. Finally, prediction and validation of lncRNA-interacting proteins by coupling in silico tools with molecular biology methods will result in the identification of new pathways involved in HCM, shedding light into the development of future drug treatments. If replacement of 50% of animals for HCM research could be achieved by further validating the human model, this will equate to sparing of 2100-5000 animals (of all species) in severe procedures in the next 10 years.

If replacement of 50% of animals for HCM research could be achieved by further validating the human model, this will equate to sparing of 2100-5000 animals (of all species) in severe procedures in the next 10 years.

Summary: The cardiac sarcomere is a multi-protein complex essential to cardiac contractile function. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) are caused by pathogenic variants (PV) in sarcomere protein genes. Variants in genes directly involved in cellular contractility MYH7 (&beta;-myosin heavy chain), MYH6 (&alpha;-myosin heavy chain), and MYBPC3 (Myosin binding protein C) are either known or hypothesised to cause disease. Previous analyses of the mechanisms by which variants cause disease have relied on rodent models and extrapolation from clinical data. The introduction of clinically defined mutations into human iPSC-CMs using CRISPR/Cas-9 would allow the interrogation of these cellular phenotypes in a human background using molecular and mechanical strategies, adding clarity to the uncertainties of variant-phenotype relationships in these genes. Key goals: i) Interrogation of the molecular and biophysical (contraction and relaxation) mechanisms by which PVs in MYH7, MYH6, and MYBPC3 cause either HCM or DCM. ii) Define the contractile mechanism of MYH6 and MYH7 PVs to establish if they mirror one another. iii) Investigate if high throughput functional analyses of iPSC-CMs can be used to test individual variants of unknown clinical significance (VUS) to discriminate between those that are disease causing versus ‘benign’.

Other typical OI features such as blue sclerae, dentinogenesis imperfecta and hearing loss are not consistently present. Homozygous mutations in TMEM38B gene encoding for a potassium channel (TRIC-B) are responsible for the disease. TRIC-B is present in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane of non excitable cells and allows the potassium ions to move from the cytosol to the ensoplasmic reticulum (ER), thus acting as positive charge exchanger required for the exit of positive calcium ions from the ER without altering the potential membrane. Calcium homeostasis is very important for cellular function. The exact molecular mechanism linking the loss of TRIC-B function to the skeletal phenotype in OI type XIV is still unknown. The aim of our research will be to develop and use in vitro and in vivo models to test the hypothesis that altered proliferation and differentiation caused by altered intracellular calcium concentration could be causing OI type XIV bone fragility. The TMEM38B gene will be knocked out by CRISPR/Cas9 genomic engineering tool in an immortalized human osteoblast line widely used as model for osteoblastogenesis investigation. Proliferation and differentiation will be evaluated in control and mutated cells. To confirm our in vitro data we plan to generate a zebrafish model for OI type XIV using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology to knock out tmem38b gene. The success of the targeting will be demonstrated at the gene and protein level and mutant zebrafish bone phenotype will be investigated to validate it as model for OI type XIV.

130    Dr de la Vega Laureano    University of Dundee    2017-02-01    2023-01-31    HIPK2 as a novel determinant of cancer therapeutic resistance    Background The homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) is a multi-functional transcriptional regulator that works as an integrator of stress signals and is involved in cell growth, apoptosis, proliferation and development. Traditionally HIPK2 has been considered a potential tumour suppressor, but recent studies suggest a novel oncogenic role for HIPK2. While the pathways involved in its tumour suppressor role are relatively well studied, the underlying mechanisms mediating the pro-oncogenic function(s) of HIPK2 remain unclear. We have already uncovered a link connecting HIPK2 with a mayor pathway involved in chemoresistance. Our hypothesis is that HIPK2 is a major factor controlling cancer cell fate, by inducing either cell death or cell survival, and it can promote chemoresistance by activating multiple pathways. Understanding the conditions that drive HIPK2 towards cell survival and the signalling pathways involved, could establish HIPK2 as a potential therapeutic/prognostic factor. Aims Aim 1. To identify and characterise pathways involved in HIPK2-mediated chemoresistance Aim 2. To determine what makes HIPK2 a pro-survival factor Aim 3. To define the potential clinical value of HIPK2 Methods - CRISPR/Cas9 to knock-out, knock-in mutations or tag endogenous genes. - SILAC and RNA-seq to identify pathways regulated by HIPK2. - CRISPR-based library screening to identify HIPK2-regulated pathways involved in chemoresistance. - Automated quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence analysis of HIPK2 in tumours and correlation with survival/response to treatment. How the results of this research will be used It will provide key insights into the mechanisms underlying tumour therapeutic responses, by characterising new pathways involved in chemoresistance that may reveal HIPK2 as a potential prognostic/therapeutic target.

131    Dr de la Vega Laureano    University of Berne    2015-10-01    2018-09-30    Quality control of gene expression: towards understanding mechanism and physiological role of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD)    The term “Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay” (NMD) was originally coined to describe a translation-dependent process that degrades mRNAs with truncated open reading frames (ORFs). By recognizing and degrading mRNAs with premature termination codons (PTCs), many of which arise by alternative splicing, NMD serves as a quality control of gene expression and protects the cell from accumulating C-terminally truncated proteins with potentially toxic functions. However, a more general role of NMD in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression emerged from transcriptome-wide mRNA profilings that identified many physiological (i.e. PTC-free) mRNAs as NMD targets, overall affecting the mRNA levels of 3 - 10% of all genes in yeast, Drosophila, and human cells. NMD is essential in vertebrates and an important modulator of genetic disease phenotypes in humans, since 30% of all known disease-causing mutations are predicted to trigger NMD.Over the past 10 years, our lab has contributed both to the dissection of the molecular mechanism of NMD as well as to a better understanding of the biological function of NMD in mammalian cells. With the projects proposed here, we aim at continuing our research along these two lines by using a combination of biochemical, molecular biology, cell biology and reverse genetics methods. We plan to generate several inducible pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines with mutations in various NMD factors and assess their effect on the transcriptome and the capability of the cells to differentiate. The mutations will be introduced using recently developed genome-editing techniques (CRISPR/Cas). Compared to traditional knockdown-rescue experiments, the genome editing approach has the advantage that the effect of the mutant proteins can be assessed in the absence of any remaining low levels of WT protein possibly confounding the phenotype. On the biochemical side, one of our main goals is to establish a protocol to purify specific messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) populations that have been arrested at different stages along the NMD pathway and characterizing their composition by mass spectrometry. This will give us important insight into mRNP remodeling events during NMD. A third line of research concerns a follow-up of our recent finding that NMD appears to play a role in defending cells from RNA virus replication. We want to find out what makes the Semliki Forest Virus genomic RNA an NMD substrate and test other viruses for their sensitivity to NMD.Collectively, our research aims at understanding the molecular mechanism of NMD and its physiological role in human cells. This is the basis for the future development of highly specific approaches to manipulate in a controlled way NMD activity in different disease contexts.

132    Ao. Prof. Dr. MARTENS Sascha    University of Vienna    2015-06-01    2018-05-31    On the role of the Atg11 homology domain during selective autophagy    Autophagy is an intracellular process that mediates the bulk degradation of cellular material. During autophagy double membrane-bound vesicles called autophagosomes are formed de novo. Autophagosomes initially appear as small membrane structures called isolation membranes that gradually expand and thereby sequester cellular material. After their formation autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes (in complex eukaryotes) or the vacuole (in yeast) wherein the cargo is degraded. Autophagy thereby protects cells and thus the organism from various stresses including periods of starvation, protein aggregates, intracellular pathogens and damaged organelles. Consequently autophagy has been linked to various human diseases. It is becoming increasingly clear that autophagy can be highly selective with regard to the cargo that is captures within autophagosomes. Cargo receptor proteins specifically bind the cargo link it to the autophagic machinery via their interaction with scaffold proteins. In this proposal we will focus on the conserved Atg11-homology domain in the S. cerevisiae scaffold protein Atg11 and the human FIP200 protein. S. cerevisiae Atg11 interacts with the Atg19 cargo receptor and our preliminary results show that human FIP200 interacts with the p62 cargo receptor. Both interactions are mediated by the C-terminal Atg11 homology domain in the Atg11 and FIP200 scaffold proteins, respectively. Using biochemistry we will fine map these interactions and determine the structure of the Atg11-homology domain by X-ray crystallography. The biochemical and structural results will be tested in reconstitution systems employing cell lysates from CRISPR/Cas9 genome edited human cells and in assays for selective autophagy in S. cerevisiae and human cells lines. The experiments proposed here will yield fascinating insights into the coupling of selective autophagy cargo to the autophagic machinery. The cargo receptors and autophagic scaffold proteins are playing key roles and our experiments will help to unravel the mechanisms underlying this important process.

134    Dr van der Spuy Jacqueline    VIB    2018-07-01    2023-06-30    Harnessing tumor metabolism to overcome immunosupression    Anti-cancer immunotherapy has provided patients with a promising treatment. Yet, it has also unveiled that the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) hampers the efficiency of this therapeutic option and limits its success. The concept that metabolism is able to shape the immune response has gained general acceptance. Nonetheless, little is known on how the metabolic crosstalk between different tumor compartments contributes to the harsh TME and ultimately impairs T cell fitness within the tumor. This proposal aims to decipher which metabolic changes in the TME impede proper anti-tumor immunity. Starting from the meta-analysis of public human datasets, corroborated by metabolomics and transcriptomics data from several mouse tumors, we ranked clinically relevant and altered metabolic pathways that correlate with resistance to immunotherapy. Using a CRISPR/Cas9 platform for their functional in vivo selection, we want to identify cancer cell intrinsic metabolic mediators and, indirectly, distinguish those belonging specifically to the stroma. By means of genetic tools and small molecules, we will modify promising metabolic pathways in cancer cells and stromal cells (particularly in tumor-associated macrophages) to harness tumor immunosuppression. In a mirroring approach, we will apply a similar screening tool on cytotoxic T cells to identify metabolic targets that enhance their fitness under adverse growth conditions. This will allow us to manipulate T cells ex vivo and to therapeutically intervene via adoptive T cell transfer. By analyzing the metabolic network and crosstalk within the tumor, this project will shed light on how metabolism contributes to the immunosuppressive TME and T cell maladaptation. The overall goal is to identify druggable metabolic targets that i) reinforce the intrinsic anti-tumor immune response by breaking immunosuppression and ii) promote T cell function in immunotherapeutic settings by rewiring either the TME or the T cell itself.

Lengthening or shortening of the cell cycle is a fundamental disease mechanism in development, ageing and cancer. It is likely that many developmental diseases are caused at least in large part by early defects of cell proliferation and many studies are now using mouse models of these conditions to explore this hypothesis in numerous systems. Mouse cell cycle kinetics are often investigated using thymidine analogues such as BrdU - incorporated into DNA during S-phase. These techniques rely on multiple injections or the surgical implantation of mini osmotic pumps to deliver the analogue. Recently, genetically encoded cell cycle probes have been developed and these are key to refining proliferation assays because they can be combined with live-imaging efficiently generating large datasets from fewer animals. Of these, the best existing model is the R26Fucci2aR (developed by RLM) reporter model because of the 1:1 stoichiometry of probe expression and the ability to control expression spatio-temporally with Cre-recombinase. However a number of shortcomings still exist: 1) It does not discriminate S-phase from G2/M-phases; 2) It does not discriminate G1 from quiescent cells in G0. 3) The probes are technically difficult to detect with antibodies limiting them to live studies. In order to address these shortcomings we will develop a next generation Quiescence and Cell Cycle Indicator (QuCCI) and Rosa26 QuCCi knock-in reporter mouse. QuCCi incorporates the the tried and tested probes p27K-,hCdt1(Cy-) and hGem(1/110) fused to mCerulean, mCherry and mVenus respectively including unique epitope tags. QuCCi can discriminate between cells in G1, S, G2/M and G0. The PhD student will join an existing team across Lancaster University (UK), Edinburgh University (UK) and McGill University (Canada) who have already committed time and resources to the development of the model.

Advances in targeted hormonal therapy (second generation anti-androgens) have led to more effective management of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Despite these highly potent drugs, disease recurs with new genomic and epigenetic alterations. In this ERC proposal, I will leverage my expertise in cancer genomics and a new computational methodology to unravel the landscape of lethal PCA, with a focus on determining the Achilles' heel of these aggressive tumours. In Aim 1, I will take advantage of DNA sequencing data from over 1000 patient-derived tumour samples and use highly innovative mathematical algorithms to create a detailed evolution chart for each tumour and identify driver events leading to CRPC. After nominating candidate drivers, we propose testing 10 using in vitro gain- and loss-of-function validations experiments (i. e. , CRISPR/Cas9, shRNA, and Tet-On assays) in PCA cell lines using migration, invasion, and cell cycle as readouts. In Aim 2, I will focus on genomic events that occur in recalcitrant CRPC, positing that genetic alterations occurring prior or secondary to treatment harbour clues into resistance. In vitro validations will be performed on the top 10 biomarkers. In Aim 3, I will nominate synthetic lethality combinations by mining CRPC genomic data taken from Stand Up 2 Cancer CRPC clinical trials. I will prioritize mutually exclusive genomic alterations in genes for which approved drugs exist. The top 5-10 candidates will be validated in a prostate lineage-specific manner. In summary, this ERC proposal will leverage my many years of expertise in PCA genomics and emerging public and private CRPC datasets to uncover driver mutations that will enhance our understanding of recalcitrant CRPC.

140    Dr. Westra Edze    University of Exeter    2017-01-01    2021-12-31    The evolutionary ecology of bacterial immune mechanisms    Bacteria have a range of immune mechanisms, but it is unclear why this diverse armamentarium evolved. The most important immune mechanisms are (1) Surface Modification (SM) (2) Abortive infection (Abi) (3) Restriction Modification (R-M) (4) CRISPR-Cas and (5) prokaryotic Argonaute (pAgo), all of which can occur as stand-alone mechanisms or in combination. The individual mechanisms differ in key aspects, such as their fitness costs (constitutive versus inducible), specificity (indiscriminate versus specific), the recipient of the benefits (individual versus group), the speed of de novo resistance evolution (rapid versus slow), and heritability of immunity. Here I will take a combined in vitro and in vivo approach to tease apart the variables that drive the evolution of these diverse stand-alone and integrated bacterial immune strategies in nature, and examine their associated co-evolutionary dynamics. I focus on three ecological variables that are consistently important in host-symbiont co-evolution: (1) force of infection (2) spatial structure (3) presence of mutualists (plasmids). First, I will perform in vitro manipulations using Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 variants that carry either single or multiple immune mechanisms. Next, I will sequence metagenomes, transcriptomes and viromes of microbial communities from environments that differ in ecological variables that are important in vitro, to examine their importance in vivo. Key ecological mechanisms identified in the first two parts of the project will be used to guide mesocosm experiments to experimentally confirm that these mechanisms are the drivers of the observed patterns of resistance and co-evolution in nature. Finally, I will share my data with mathematical biologists to generate theoretical models to predict and manipulate the evolution of bacterial immune mechanisms, which will facilitate tailored species protection in agriculture and industry.

This proposal is based on a new in vivo system that I have established to study axonal transport of organelles in wing sensory neurons of Drosophila melanogaster. This system allows, for the first time, organelle transport to be studied in intact adult neurons of living Drosophila over time. Longitudinal studies in this system have revealed a remarkable age-dependent decline in mitochondrial transport. My previous data suggest that experimental upregulation of mitochondrial motility delays age-associated protein aggregation and increases neuronal healthspan. I also found compelling evidence that an evolutionarily conserved signalling pathway can regulate mitochondrial transport in axons of ageing neurons. I propose to exploit this innovative imaging assay to understand the molecular mechanisms linking this specific signalling cascade to mitochondria transport and neuronal ageing. Initially, I will undertake a biochemical characterisation of this signalling pathway in Drosophila, including the identification of downstream targets that regulate transport. By using CRISPR genome engineering and tissue specific RNAi,I will attempt to identify the key regulatory nodes of the pathway. This will be followed by phenotypic analysis of neuronal function. After the Drosophila work, I will test the relevance of our findings in mammalian neurons. These experiments will be performed in cultured mouse motor neurons derived from embryonic stem cells in which mitochondria will be fluorescently labeled with a commercial dye. Finally, I will explore whether chemical activation of the pathway is sufficient to increase mitochondrial trafficking in single neurons of mouse sciatic nerve in vivo. To achieve this, I will use an available transgenic mouse strain, known as MitoMouse, which expresses a fluorescent marker of mitochondria in neurons. In these experiments,mitochondrial transport in young and old mice will be compared before and after challenging the neurons with pathway agonists.

143    Dr Piddini Eugenia    University of Bristol    2017-05-01    2022-05-01    Understanding the mechanisms of Cell Competition and its role in tissue biology    Cell competition is increasingly recognized as playing a key role in selecting the cellular composition of tissues, both in health and diseases such as cancer. My proposed research aims to advance our understanding of the mechanisms of cell competition and how it impacts on adult tissue biology, to advance our fundamental understanding of this biomedically-relevant process and learn how to harness it for therapeutics. Building on my group’s recent discoveries and methodological advances, I will use an integrated strategy combining in vitro and in vivo approaches to: 1) Elucidate how the oxidative stress response, which we found marks cells as ‘losers’ for competitive elimination, triggers cell competition in Drosophila. 2) Elucidate another link we discovered between aberrant autophagy in ‘loser’ cells and cell competition, in Drosophila. 3) Characterize the molecular mechanisms behind our discovery of p53-induced cell competition, using a CRISPR-based genomic screen in mammalian cultured cells. 4) Investigate the impact of cell competition on human adult tissue biology, using human primary keratinocytes and p53 competition-inducing mutations. 5) Carry out targeted proof-of-principle experiments to investigate for the first time whether cell competition can be exploited to improve tissue engraftment and repopulation in vivo, using the mouse airway.

144    Professor Vormoor Josef    Newcastle University    2017-01-01    2021-12-31    Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia - targeting novel mechanisms of clonal survival and expansion    Background: Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy in children and adolescents and, despite its high cure rate, remains one of the major causes of cancer-related and overall childhood deaths. Moreover, 2 – 3 years of chemotherapy are associated with significant morbidity and rare but potentially life-changing long-term toxicity, necessitating the need for more effective and less toxic therapies. Aims: The vision for this programme is to develop rationally designed, small molecule-based combination therapies for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: combinations that are highly active, non-toxic and prevent the emergence of resistant subclones. Methods: These combinations will be based on: • Targeted therapies that we are currently taking into early phase clinical trials in children with relapsed ALL (e.g. MEK and BCL2 inhibition) • Hypotheses-driven approaches (e.g. reactivation of p53, a key mediator of negative selection in normal B cell development) • Functional CRISPR screens in patient-derived cells to identify synthetic vulnerabilities in the context of exposure to targeted therapies • The identification of therapeutic targets through genome-wide CRISPR screens and the analysis of leukaemia-specific gene splicing Genome-wide CRISPR screening in the context of targeted therapies offers a step change in our ability to interrogate pathway dependencies and to select the most suitable inhibitors for effective combination therapies. Unbiased CRISPR screening in patient-derived cells and the analysis of plant homeodomain finger protein 5A (PHF5A)-mediated RNA splicing will determine the key drivers of the malignant phenotype in ALL. Our screens will identify opportunities for repurposing drugs already in clinical development and provide new targets for drug discovery. Most importantly, they will inform the translational/preclinical component of our programme in which we will test novel combination therapies using patient-derived cells in clinically relevant ex vivo and in vivo models. How the results of this research will be used: Our programme will generate robust preclinical data for novel combination therapies, based on mechanistic hypotheses and unbiased screening approaches, as the basis for innovative early phase clinical trials.

145    Professor Vormoor Josef    Queen's University of Belfast    2019-10-01    2022-09-30    Development of novel models of kidney damage using induced human pluripotent stem cells    Animal models play a central role in the study of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Researchers have used mice and rats to model kidney damage seen in human patients with diabetes, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, lupus and fibrosis injury. Although many useful gene and protein targets have emerged from these studies, rodent models are limited for a number of reasons. One is the ethical issues around the numbers of mice in particular that are needed to generate gene knockouts, particularly tissue-specific knockouts (usually in the 100s-1000s). A second limitation is the fact that mice and rat models do not faithfully recapitulate the disease phenotype seen in the human kidney. For example, the most commonly used genetic strain of mice, C57Bl/6, are resistant to diabetes-induced kidney damage. Many gene and proteins that have been identified in rodent models have failed to materialise as bona fide targets when tested in humans. These limitations have led to a growing frustration in academia and industry, and led to the drive to improve our models of CKD. We propose to establish a new model of kidney injury based on 3D organoids derived from human iPS cells. Our protocol of differentiation triggers the formation of both glomerular and tubular epithelial cells that form themselves into glomerular-like and tubule-like structures (Fig. 2). These organoids will form the basis of the three interrelated project aims, which will use cell biology, microscopy and single cell sequencing to interrogate the genetic profile of the kidney organoid cells (Aim 1). We will then establish a range of new models of CKD exposing organoids to high glucose and other important drivers of kidney disease to induce damage. Cutting-edge single cell sequencing using the 10 x Genomics platform (https://www.10xgenomics.com) will be applied in-house to interrogate the genetic profiles of each of the different kidney-like cells in 3D organoids in normal versus disease conditions. The sequencing data obtained from the various organoid damage models will then be compared to existing datasets from previously used rodent models of disease available on the GEO bioinformatics platform (e.g. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/GDSbrowser?acc=GDS3990). The critical role of Gremlin1 in organoid formation and response to fibrotic insult will be tested using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Successful completion of this project will achieve a number of scientific objectives. The first is the development of a next generation cell culture organoid model of kidney injury and CKD. The development of 3D organoid models is a common direction of travel in many fields, as the limitations of studying individual cells in isolation are becoming increasingly evident. A major outcome from this proposal will be reduction potential under the NC3Rs framework. Given the numbers of mice used for CKD experiments each year (estimated at approximately 68,000 in 2016, Fig. 1), and the moderate/severe grading of many of these experiments, we believe there is exciting potential to reduce these numbers in the future. Another significant deliverable will be the use of human iPS cells to generate the kidney organoids, which will represent a translationally relevant model of human kidney disease. The potential to modify the ES cells at the gene level using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing will allow researchers to interrogate the role of their gene of interest not only in kidney development, but also in kidney cell responses to disease insults in a 3D organoid. We will use our networks such as the European Renal Cell Study Group (ERSCG) in the UK, Europe and the US to promote the potential of the organoid model as an alternative to rodent models of CKD. Dissemination of our results at national meetings such as the UK Kidney Week and the American Society of Nephrology will maximise the potential of widespread uptake and create exciting added value for the project.

146    Professor Vormoor Josef    Fundació Privada Centre de Regulacio Genomica    2015-04-01    2020-04-01    Functions and evolutionary impact of transcriptomic novelties in the vertebrate brain    Alternative splicing (AS) is the largest contributor to transcriptomic diversification in metazoans. In particular, mirroring their unparalleled morphological and cellular complexity, vertebrate brains show the highest levels of regulated AS known in nature. However, the functions of most of these alternative transcripts, and the evolutionary impact that the increased transcriptional complexity has had on the evolution of the vertebrate brain are still widely unexplored. In this project, we will investigate the functions and evolutionary impact of neural AS in vertebrates. We will focus on neural-specific alternative exons that are highly conserved across vertebrate groups (suggesting functional importance), but that are not conserved in invertebrates, and are thus vertebrate-specific genomic novelties. We will term these exons Vertebrate- and Neural-specific Alternatively Spliced (VN-AS) exons. Through a combination of bioinformatics, experimental manipulation in models species, and systems-level network analysis, we aim to: (i) Comprehensively identify VN-AS exons, and study their regulation during vertebrate neurogenesis and nervous system development, using RNA-seq and comparative genomics; (ii) Probe the phenotypic impact of VN-AS exons on vertebrate nervous systems, using the CRISPR-Cas technology for genome editing; and (iii) Investigate how VN-AS exons rewire protein-protein interaction networks in vertebrate neurons - an emergent molecular function for AS -, and whether this rewiring underlies novel functions of VN-AS exons in the vertebrate brains. This project will thus deliver fundamental insight into two major unanswered questions: (i) what are the functions of transcriptomic diversification, and (ii) how does transcriptomic diversification impact organismal evolution. Our results will fill a large gap of knowledge in our current understanding of brain evolution and development, providing a complementary angle to traditional gene expression studies.

147    Professor Santocanale Corrado    National University Of Ireland, Galway    2016-02-01    2019-01-31    Cellular responses to ATP competitive CDC7 kinase inhibitors    CDC7 kinase is considered a key switch for DNA replication and its depletion by siRNA causes cancer cells to stop DNA synthesis and to die in a p53 independent manner. Many institutions are developing CDC7 inhibitors (CDC7i), which block its enzymatic activity by competing with ATP, as potential agents for refractory p53 deficient cancers. Some CDC7i have excellent antitumor activity, especially in breast cancer models, and are approaching clinical trials. On the contrary, others compounds equally able to inhibit CDC7, only have marginal effect on DNA synthesis and proliferation. Such striking differences in cellular responses to CDC7 inhibition can be due to 1) off-target effects of siRNA and drugs 2) differences between protein depletion and inhibition of its kinase activity and 3) existence of mechanisms that can compensate for loss of CDC7 activity. Aims The overarching question is “How do breast cancer cells respond to CDC7 kinase inhibition and what are the genetic determinants that affect response?” Specific objectives are: 1) Develop genetic cellular models that will unequivocally allow characterization of cellular phenotypes associated with rapid and specific inhibition of CDC7. 2) Identify cellular factors that modulate the response to CDC7i. Techniques and Methodology 1) Exploiting the concept of the “analogue sensitive kinase”, we will generate cellular models in which CDC7 activity can be rapidly and efficiently modulated, with minimal off-target effects. This will be accomplished using CRISPR/CAS9 gene editing technology. 2) Using lentivirus sgRNA pooled libraries, we will perform large-scale loss-of function screens to identify cellular factors that increase the efficacy of CDC7i. Impact on breast cancer research This work will validate the use of CDC7i in breast cancer indicating which genes are involved in determining the sensitivity to CDC7i and it will advance understanding of cell-cycle regulation.

148    Dr Mullan Paul    Queen's University Belfast    2015-05-11    2018-11-01    Exploiting the TBX2 repression of CST6 as a novel treatment strategy for poor prognosis breast cancers.    TBX2 is an oncogenic transcription factor known to drive breast cancer proliferation. We have identified Cystatin 6 (CST6) as a consistently repressed TBX2 target. CST6 is a proposed tumour suppressor gene (TSG) and expression of CST6 in TBX2-expressing breast cancer cells induced apoptosis whilst non-tumorigenic breast cells remained unaffected. Functionally, CST6 is a protease inhibitor with extremely high affinity for the cancer-associated enzyme Legumain (LGMN). We have developed a series of small compound LGMN inhibitors (LGMNi's) which selectively kill TBX2/LGMN expressing breast cancer cell lines. Aims To define the TBX2 transcriptional repression complex To characterise TBX2/KAP1/HP1 epigenetic events in breast cancers To develop genetic screens of CST6 biology and LGMNi responses Techniques and Methodology Aim 1: Cell signalling methodologies (RqPCR, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, apoptosis/senescence assays, cell cycle analyses) will investigate the cellular effects of CST6 knockdown in non-tumorigenic cells. Lentiviral generation of CST6-promoter luciferase reporter cell lines and esiRNA screens will be used to identify epigenetic events occurring at the CST6 promoter. Aim 2: ChIP-seq for TBX2 and known interactors (HP1,KAP1) and DNA Methylation array analyses will be overlapped with a TBX2 microarray differential genelist to identify markers (e.g. CST6) co-ordinately regulated by this complex and pyrosequencing will validate candidate methylated genomic regions. Aim 3: Genome-wide screening using a CRISPR (GeCKO) library to look for (i) events promoting emergence of CST6-deficient breast cancers, and (ii) genes whose loss-of-function contributes to resistance to LGMNi's. Both screens will be validated in vitro (si/shRNA) and in vivo modelling (orthotopic implantation of luciferase-labelled lines) used to evaluate efficacy of LGMNi's using IVIS. Post mortem examination of mice will test utilities of selected PD biomarkers for LGMNi's. Impact on breast cancer research This proposal highlights a novel breast cancer pathway linked to poor outcomes which we will target with new anti-cancer (LGMNi) drugs.

In particular it will address the role of the actin nucleator JMY, a p53 co-factor that impacts of autophagosome formation, cell motility and survival in autophagy-mediated effects on cell survival and the role of actin nucleation. Specific goals during the duration of the funding: -assess autophagy levels (both basal and induced) in cancer cells lines and correlate with cell motility and invasion (also assessing cell survival and adhesion/motility events, using impedance measurements, to distinguish between effects on proliferation vs motility). -Assess impact of JMY on autophagy-mediated motility (using specific mutants to distinguish autophagosome targeted vs not, and Arp2/3-independent vs dependent actin nucleation. -Assess impact of modulating autophagy levels on cell motility (i.e., through siRNA/CRISPR-Cas9 targetting of JMY and autophagy initiator proteins and small molecule inhibitors of various stages in autophagosome formation).

152    Dr Batada Nizar    University of Edinburgh    2017-05-01    2019-05-01    QMAT-seq: A Novel CRISPR/Cas9 based assay for studying DNA repair associated mutations    Mutations are a root cause of cancer. In skin and lung cancers, they often result from exposure to environmental mutagens such as cigarette smoke or UV light; however, in other cancers, their causes remain unexplained. Restoration of DNA-repair in mice with BRCA1-deficiency prevents tumour formation revealing that defective DNA-repair contributes to cancer. The Alternative-Non-Homologous-End-Joining (A-EJ) pathway has recently been discovered and shown to promote genome instability and therapy resistance in BRCA1-deficient cancers but only few components of A-EJ pathway are known. In addition the causes of their activation remain elusive. Inhibition of A-EJ could be an effective therapy for cancers associated with DNA repair deficiency. In pump-priming experiments that will establish proof of concept for my new laboratory in the UK, I will develop novel quantitative laboratory assay for A-EJ employing cutting-edge CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, high-throughput sequencing and machine learning algorithm. My long-term goal is to elucidate A-EJ regulation, to identify new members of the A-EJ pathway and to define its mutational footprints that will serve as a biomarker of DNA repair deficiency. The outcomes of this seed funding will enable me to secure long-term funding to study A-EJ in cancer and its potential in cancer stratification and personalized therapy.

153    Dr Batada Nizar    Queensland Brain Institute The University of Queensland    2017-04-01    2018-09-30    Dissecting the dendritic function of Tau protein and the Src kinase FYN, two proteins implicated in Alzheimer’s disease    BACKGROUND: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder worldwide, affecting 2% of the population in industrialized countries. The disease is marked by the presence of extracellular plaques - composed of aggregated amyloid-ß peptide (Aß) - and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) - consisting of aggregates of abnormally hyperphosphorylated Tau protein. Recent studies showed that Aß and abnormal Tau protein may interact and have synergistic toxic effects, leading to neuronal death in AD, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Although Tau was primarily described as an axonal protein stabilizing microtubule function and assembly, new findings obtained in the laboratory of Professor Jürgen Götz at the University of Queensland (Australia) identified a dendritic function of this protein that seems to be crucial in mediating Aß toxicity at the postsynaptic compartment. Indeed, Tau is required for the targeting of FYN, a Src kinase widely expressed in the hippocampus, to dendritic spines. FYN phosphorylates the GluN2B subunit of the NMDA receptor, which is essential for recruiting the postsynaptic density (95kD) protein (PSD95). This enhances the stability of the receptor complex at the synaptic membrane, which boosts the excitotoxic signaling induced by the presence of Aß. Interestingly, in absence of Tau, the targeting/clustering of FYN is massively reduced in the dendritic spines and, vice versa, when tau is pseudo-phosphorylated at distinct phosphorylation sites (AT180 - 12E8 - PHF1 - S396/S404), targeting of Tau and FYN to spines is markedly increased. Together, this identifies a cross-talk between the two molecules which we intend to further dissect in the present proposal.HYPOTHESIS: Thus, based on the previous and preliminary data obtained in the laboratory of Prof. Götz, the overarching hypothesis of the project is that the subcellular localization, trafficking and clustering of FYN and Tau are tightly regulated in a physiological and pathological context (AD).AIMS: The specific aims of the present study are to prove our hypothesis and to enhance our understanding of the endogenous regulation of Tau and FYN trafficking to the dendritic spine. For this approach, a combination of technics (biochemical, pharmacological as well as super-resolution microscopy) established in the Götz laboratory, will be used to identify the mechanisms underlying the targeting of Tau and FYN at the spine, under physiological and pathological (AD) conditions. Especially, we will use novel gene-edited mouse strains created in the Götz laboratory with the TALEN / CRISPR technology, introducing a photo-convertible mEOS2 tag in-frame into the carboxy-terminus of either the Tau-encoding gene or the FYN-encoding gene. The fluorescence emitted by Tau-mEOS2 and FYN-mEOS2 will be analyzed using super resolution microscopy technics, including the single particle tracking photo-activated localization microscopy (sptPALM).Using these tools, we would like to pursue two main objectives as part of this program:Specific Aim 1: To determine the mobility of FYN and Tau in the somato-dendritic domain and spines: i) under physiological conditions; ii) after neuronal activation and; iii) in the presence of Aß.Specific Aim 2: To determine whether Tau controls FYN clustering (i.e. the formation of nanoclusters).IMPACT: The current approach opens the opportunity to dissect a novel fundamental mechanism and identifies how the two key molecules in AD, Aß and Tau, interact via FYN to exert their toxic effects. It uses state-of-the-art technology and has ramifications for additional neurodegenerative diseases with protein aggregation, as well as for the role Tau and FYN have in a physiological context and the identification of new therapeutic targets for the treatment of AD.

154    Dr Batada Nizar    University of Fribourg    2015-10-01    2018-09-30    Mechanisms of organ regeneration in zebrafish    Human regenerative capacity is commonly inadequate after injury. By contrast, some lower vertebrates, such as zebrafish, can perfectly reconstruct their damaged organs, such as appendages, heart, retina and spinal cord. Little is known about biological factors that permit or suppress the natural ability of organ regeneration. Our goal is to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms that generate new cells for fin and heart regeneration in zebrafish. We will focus on dedifferentiation processes that transform mature cells at the site of injury into a progenitor cell pool, called the blastema. An understanding of blastema formation and regulation both in the fin and heart will elucidate common principles of the regenerative machinery. On the other hand, we will investigate the factors stimulating cardiac cell proliferation and transient scar deposition after heart infarction. This undertaking will demand the use of existing methods, as well as developing novel research tools in adult zebrafish, such as the inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system technology. A conceptual and molecular deciphering of mechanisms of natural regeneration in lower vertebrates will help to build a foundation for regenerative medicine.

155    Dr Batada Nizar    University of Lausanne    2016-02-01    2019-01-31    ALK in the control of neural crest differentiation and neuroblastic tumor development    ALK IN THE CONTROL OF NEURAL CREST DIFFERENTIATION AND NEUROBLASTIC TUMOR DEVELOPMENT Neuroblastoma (NB) is a classical pediatric cancer originating from aberrant differentiation of neural crest (NC)-derived sympathoadrenal progenitors. The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene is a major oncogene in NB, and ALK activating mutations or wild-type (wt) expression are associated with poor clinical outcome. The implication of ALK-wt, and the ALK activating mutations, ALK-F1174L, and ALK-R1275Q, in NC progenitor fate and neuroblastomagenesis was previously investigated using immortalized murine neural crest progenitor cells (NCPC), MONC-1 and JoMa-1. In vivo studies by orthotopic (adrenal gland) implantations reveled that MONC-1 cells could generate various tumor types, such as NB, osteo/chondrosarcoma, and undifferentiated tumors. In contrast, MONC-1 cells expressing ALK-F1174L only produced highly aggressive undifferentiated NC cell-derived tumors, similarly to JoMa1 cells overexpressing ALK-wt, or activating ALK mutants. JoMa1-ALK-derived tumors expressed high levels of various stem cells (SC) and NC stem cell (NCSC) associated markers, confirming their stem-like and phenotypes, and suggesting an ALK-mediated impairment of NCPC differentiation potential in vivo.The specific objectives of the present project are to investigate the functional role of ALK and its downstream pathways in the control of NCPC differentiation potential and fate, as well as to elucidate the involvement of activated ALK in the maturation of the sympathoadrenal lineage and in NB differentiation. Using ALK-transduced NCPC cell lines described above in combination with specific ALK and ALK signaling pathways inhibitors, we will investigate the influence of activated ALK signaling on NCPC differentiation capacity and fate in vitro. To increase our knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms and transcriptional controllers involved in ALK-mediated blockage of NCPC differentiation in vivo, we plan to investigate the global epigenetic patterns and the expression profiles associated to NB orthotopic tumors-derived from MONC1 cells as compared to undifferentiated tumors-derived from MONC-1-ALK-F cells. The role of putative ALK target genes, Myc and Twist1/2, or of newly identified key transcriptional regulators in the control of NCPC differentiation will be explored by means of specific inhibitors and/or silencing strategies through CRISPR/Cas9. In addition, a special focus will be dedicated to the involvement of ALK deregulated activation in the differentiation and maturation of normal sympathetic neurons and adrenal chromaffin cells, using ALK-mutants knock-in mice, as well as in NB cell differentiation potential using ALK overexpressing NB cell lines. Moreover, clinical NB samples will be examined to identify a possible correlation between ALK expression level and/or localization, and neublastic cell differentiation status within individual tumors.This project will be performed within an established collaborative international team of experts in NC development (Prof. L. Sommer and Dr O. Shakhova), in the molecular genetics of NB (Drs I. Janoueix-Lerosey and G. Schleiermacher), in NB orthotopic modeling (Dr J.-M. Joseph), in NB histopathology (Dr M. Peuchmaur), and in epigenetic regulation of solid tumors (Dr N. Riggi). This study should provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms responsible for dysfunctional NC cell maturation responsible for NB development, and may contribute to the identification of new therapeutic options.

156    Dr Batada Nizar    University of Zurich    2015-06-01    2018-05-31    Role of Scavenger Receptor BI and Endothelial Lipase in the Transendothelial Transport of High Density Lipoproteins    Background: High density lipoproteins (HDL) and their main protein constituent and precursor, apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), exert several atheroprotective actions within the vascular wall, notably the removal of cholesterol from macrophage foam cells for reverse transport to the liver. However, it is little understood how HDL and apoA-I pass the endothelial barriers to reach and leave the arterial intima with the lipid laden macrophages. We have previously found that aortic endothelial cells bind, internalize and resecrete apoA-I and HDL by processes that are modulated by the ATP binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1, respectively, as well as the scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI), endothelial lipase (EL), and the ectopic F0F1-ATPase/P2Y12 axis. We have not yet unravelled the mechanisms by which these proteins contribute to endothelial transcytosis of HDL. For this proposal we will focus on the role of SR-BI and EL.Working hypothesis: SR-BI and EL are HDL binding proteins that mediate the internalization of HDL either directly as an endocytic receptor (notably the SR-BII splice variant of SCARB1) or indirectly by transducing signals to an endocytic machinery (SR-BI via its PDZ or cholesterol sensing domains) or generating signaling molecules (EL by generating lysophosphatidylcholines or exposing S1P). Specific aims: In two subprojects we want to answer the following two questions: 1. How do SR-BI and EL regulate the internalization and trafficking of HDL through endothelial cells? 2. Do EL and SR-BI modulate transendothelial transport of HDL in vivo? Experimental design: For amswering the first question we will generate human aortic and lymphatic endothelial cell lines (HAEC and HLEC) with knock-outs of the SCARB1 and LIPG genes using the CRISPR/Cas system. The SCARB1 ko cell line will be knocked-in with either of the two isoforms SR-BI or SR-BII or with two SR-BI mutants which lack the signaling PDZ domain or the cholesterol sensing activity. The LIPG1 ko cells will be knocked-in with either wild type EL or an enzymatically inactive EL mutant. After confirming the endothelial phenotype the individual cell lines as well as the effective knock-outs and knock-ins, the cells will be analyzed for their function to bind, internalize and transport HDL per se and after complementation with signaling molecules (EL knock-out and knock-in cell lines). These biochemical experiments will be complemented by fluorescence microscopy studies to unravel any erroneous trafficking of HDL. The cells will also be characterized for other responses to HDL, notably in nitric oxide production, VCAM-1 expression, apoptosis, endothelial repair, and phosphorylation of signaling molecules. The second question will be approached by comparing the kinetics of radiocatively labeled HDL and control proteins in SCARB1 ko mice, LIPG ko mice and wild type mice. We will inject radioiodinated HDL, albumin or LDL into the tail vein to monitor its appearance in the arterial wall and peritoneal cave as well as into the peritoneal cave or foot pads to monitor its appearance in plasma. We will also use two photon live microscopy to study the kinetics by which fluorescence labeled HDL and control proteins injected intravenously and subcutaneously appear in the interstial space and microvessels of the skin, respectively. Expected value: Our project will answer a key question on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, namely how HDL particles enter and leave the vascular wall. This process is a pre-requisite for the mediation of anti-atherogenic functions of HDL and therefore a potential target for anti-atherosclerotic drug therapy.

One type of chronic pain, neuropathic pain, is expected to affect more than 75 million of people worldwide. Neuropathic pain (NP) as defined by the IASP is a “Pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system”. This clinical syndrome may appear in the context of many different alterations of the peripheral and central nervous system; from radiculopathy induced by disk hernia, traumatic or compressive (tumors) nerve injuries, toxic, metabolic or infectious conditions (chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, AIDS-related pain, and so on) to multiple sclerosis, stroke or Parkinson disease. Neuropathic pain is associated with hyperexcitability of the central and the peripheral nervous systems, resulting in ongoing pain, allodynia (innocuous stimuli that become painful), hyperalgesia (exaggerated and prolonged pain response in response to noxious stimuli) and negative symptoms such as hypoalgesia. Increased neuronal activity can explain both spontaneous and exaggerated stimulus-evoked pain. In the nervous system, the excitability is mainly carried by voltage-gated sodium channels (Navs) that are responsible for the upstroke of action potentials. Navs are heteromeric glycosylated protein composed of a large pore-forming a-subunit and small ß-auxiliary subunits. Nine genes encode for distinct channel isoforms (Nav1.1 to Nav1.9) and all, except Nav1.4 and Nav1.5, are expressed in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) nociceptive neurons. In these neurons, Nav1.7 has been found to be the most expressed TTX-sensitive isoform compared to Nav1.1, Nav1.2, Nav1.3 and Nav1.6, and is coexpressed with the two TTX resistant isoforms, Nav1.8 and Nav1.9.In neuropathic pain, accumulation of Nav1.7, Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 was reported in the primary afference. In addition to this acquired pain syndrome, the contribution of Nav1.7 in inherited pain disorders has been recurrently reported. Congenital insensitivity to pain due to loss-of-function of the channel were first described in 2006 and since then other mutations have been reported. On the other side of the spectrum, multiple gain-of-functions mutations were shown to be associated with two exaggerated pain sensitivity pathologies, namely inherited erythromyelagia (IEM) and paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (PEPD). More recently, studies also highlighted a role for Nav1.7 in idiopathic small-fiber neuropathy (I-SFN); nearly 30% of patients suffering from this pathology presented a gain-of function mutation in Nav1.7. Small fiber peripheral neuropathy is a type of peripheral neuropathy that occurs from damage to C-fibers and A-d fibers that are the small unmyelinated and thinly myelinated peripheral nerve fibers belonging to nociceptive neurons. Since then, similar gain-of-function mutations in Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 have also been reported. I-SFN is not only accompanied with neuronal hyperexcitability but is also associated with axonal degeneration and neuronal death. Now what is hypothesized, but remains to be demonstrated is whether the hyperexcitability is responsible for the axonal degeneration. In vitro experiments confirmed that 1) these mutations induced modification of the biophysical properties of the different Navs in cell expression system and 2) led to DRG neurons hyperexcitability. These two combined approaches however present limitations. HEK cells do not express endogenous Navs proteins and are thus widely used to characterize the effect of a mutation on a particular canal biophysical properties. However the modulation of activity of the channel might significantly vary between different cell types and HEK cells do not necessarily reflect DRG neurons. Another limitation of cell expression system is that HEK cells no not express potassium channel, consequently the effect of these mutations on the overall cellular excitability cannot be investigated under current clamp mode (recording of action potentials is not possible). To study the effect of mutation on cellular excitability, another approach using primary culture of mice nociceptive neurons transfected with human Nav1.7 containing the specific mutation is commonly used. The main limitation of this approach is that the mutated human cDNA is expressed together with the two wild-type mice alleles; thus there is an interspecies gene coexpression and a contamination of the mutated cDNA with the endogenous allele. Another approach to investigate these single mutations of Nav1.7/1.8/1.9 would be to generate knock-in mice harbouring these mutations. But generating such knock-in mice line with the traditional approach is laborious and time consuming and has consequently never been performed in the pain field. It is well-known that upon repetitive stimulation of the primary afference, the input into the central nervous system will be potentiated. The synaptic strength between primary and secondary order neuron is increased, ultimately leading to the hyperexcitability of the dorsal horn nociceptive neurons. This process is referred to as central sensitization, a mechanism first described by Clifford Woolf, and that has been extensively studied since then. Nothing is known on the effect of the gain-of-function mutations of Nav1.7 on mechanisms of central sensitization. It is likely that the increased excitability observed in the periphery will also lead to a strengthening of the spinal cord input.AIMBecause the use of human cell lines and primary nociceptive neuron cultures both show limitations (discussed above) in AIM 1 we plan to investigate the effect of Nav1.7/1.8/1.9 I-SNF mutations on human nociceptor-like neurons excitability. We will also test the hypothesis of whether the hyperexcitability is responsible for the axonal degeneration observed in I-SFN.We will use a two-step experimental approach: 1) we will transdifferentiate human fibroblasts into nociceptor-like neurons and 2) we will use the clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system to generate these mutations in the aforementioned human nociceptive neurons. We will determine whether these mutated human nociceptive neurons also present a hyperexcitable phenotype using electrophysiology (using both voltage- and current-clamp and calcium imaging) similarly to what is observed with HEK293 cells and sensory neurons primary culture. We will then compare the observed electrical pattern with the one obtained from nociceptors derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with these mutations (from Ingemar Merkies, a collaborator of Prof. Woolf). The impact of these mutations on the cellular excitability using this approach will give results that are physiologically closer to what happens in humans and also provide a proof-of-concept that this new experimental approach is relevant. To have better insight on the in vivo effect of Nav1.7/1.8/1.9 I-SNF mutations, in AIM 2 we will also take advantage of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate knock-in mice harboring these mutations and test whether these mice develop I-SNF. We will use optogenetics, a tool that allows a very precise spatiotemporal control of neuronal excitability, to investigate how these mutations modify the cellular excitability of sensory neurons upon exogenous stimulation. In AIM3 we will again take advantage of optogenetics to investigate whether stimulation of nociceptors harbouring Nav1.7/1.8/1.9 I-SNF mutations with blue light strengthen the input into the spinal cord.Finally, as I extensively investigated Nedd4-2 effect on Navs turnover, in AIM 4 I will also use the CRISPR/Cas9 system to mutate this ubiquitin ligase in nociceptors-like human neurons and in mice and test the hypothesis that this leads to an increased neuronal excitability and pain hypersensitivity.

158    Dr. NIVARTHI Harini    CeMM- Center for Molecular Medicine    2017-06-01    2020-05-31    Mechanism of CALR mutants in Myeloproliferative Neoplasms    Molecular Mechanism of CALR Mutations in Myeloproliferative Neoplasms “Frameshift” mutations in the CALR gene are seen in about 25% of patients suffering from myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), specifically in those suffering from Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) and Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF). CALR encodes for the protein calreticulin, which is a chaperone in the Endoplasmic Reticulum. We have recently shown that the CALR mutant proteins physically interact with the Thrombopoietin Receptor (MPL), thereby activating it in a ligand-independent manner. This results in the downstream activation of the JAK-STAT pathway. However, the molecular mechanisms of the oncogenic program driven by the CALR mutations is not completely understood. The elucidation of these molecular details will not only help in understanding the biology of these mutations, but will also provide a foundation for the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Towards this, we have generated a transgenic mouse model with a conditional ‘knock-in’ of the human CALR-del52 mutant within the mouse endogenous CALR locus. The mice develop an ET phenotype at the age of 8 weeks. We propose to characterize development of the MPN phenotype in these mice with age. This will be done by assessing the peripheral blood values, FACS analysis of the hematopoietic tissues, assessment of splenomegaly and by histology of the bone marrow (for fibrosis development). Bone marrow transplantation experiments will be performed to evaluate the stem cell cell-intrinsic requirement of the CALR mutants and engraftment capabilities. As the CALR mutant proteins induce the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, we propose to genetically (using JAK2 and STAT5 conditional knock-out mice) and pharmacologically (using JAK2 inhibitor - Ruxolitinib) interfere with this pathway, to assess the requirement of this pathway for the oncogenic function of CALR mutant proteins. To elucidate the oncogenic program of mutant CALR, we will perform a transcriptome analysis of the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) isolated from these mice. Differential expression analysis will be performed with state of the art bioinformatics tools, to identify the genes/pathways most relevant for CALR mutant driven disease. The relevance of these genes to mutant CALR oncogenicity will be tested using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. A low-complexity gRNA pool will be generated against the most significantly upregulated/downregulated genes and will be expressed (lentivirally) in the HSCs of CALR-del52;Rosa-Cas9 transgenic mice. The transduced cells will be transplanted into recipient NSG mice and the most depleted/enriched gRNAs will be identified by performing Next Generation Sequencing. The most interesting hits will be further validated in vitro (Ba/F3 cells) and in vivo using over-expression/knock-out mouse models. This study will be performed within a period of 3 years.

Researchers have used mice and rats to model kidney damage seen in human patients with diabetes, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, lupus and fibrosis injury. Although many useful gene and protein targets have emerged from these studies, rodent models are limited for a number of reasons. One is the ethical issues around the numbers of mice in particular that are needed to generate gene knockouts, particularly tissue-specific knockouts (usually in the 100s-1000s). A second limitation is the fact that mice and rat models do not faithfully recapitulate the disease phenotype seen in the human kidney. For example, the most commonly used genetic strain of mice, C57Bl/6, are resistant to diabetes-induced kidney damage. Many gene and proteins that have been identified in rodent models have failed to materialise as bona fide targets when tested in humans. These limitations have led to a growing frustration in academia and industry, and led to the drive to improve our models of CKD. We propose to establish a new model of kidney injury based on 3D organoids derived from human iPS cells. Our protocol of differentiation triggers the formation of both glomerular and tubular epithelial cells that form themselves into glomerular-like and tubule-like structures (Fig. 2). These organoids will form the basis of the three interrelated project aims, which will use cell biology, microscopy and single cell sequencing to interrogate the genetic profile of the kidney organoid cells (Aim 1). We will then establish a range of new models of CKD exposing organoids to high glucose and other important drivers of kidney disease to induce damage. Cutting-edge single cell sequencing using the 10 x Genomics platform (https://www.10xgenomics.com) will be applied in-house to interrogate the genetic profiles of each of the different kidney-like cells in 3D organoids in normal versus disease conditions. The sequencing data obtained from the various organoid damage models will then be compared to existing datasets from previously used rodent models of disease available on the GEO bioinformatics platform (e.g. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/GDSbrowser?acc=GDS3990). The critical role of Gremlin1 in organoid formation and response to fibrotic insult will be tested using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Successful completion of this project will achieve a number of scientific objectives. The first is the development of a next generation cell culture organoid model of kidney injury and CKD. The development of 3D organoid models is a common direction of travel in many fields, as the limitations of studying individual cells in isolation are becoming increasingly evident. A major outcome from this proposal will be reduction potential under the NC3Rs framework. Given the numbers of mice used for CKD experiments each year (estimated at approximately 68,000 in 2016, Fig. 1), and the moderate/severe grading of many of these experiments, we believe there is exciting potential to reduce these numbers in the future. Another significant deliverable will be the use of human iPS cells to generate the kidney organoids, which will represent a translationally relevant model of human kidney disease. The potential to modify the ES cells at the gene level using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing will allow researchers to interrogate the role of their gene of interest not only in kidney development, but also in kidney cell responses to disease insults in a 3D organoid. We will use our networks such as the European Renal Cell Study Group (ERSCG) in the UK, Europe and the US to promote the potential of the organoid model as an alternative to rodent models of CKD. Dissemination of our results at national meetings such as the UK Kidney Week and the American Society of Nephrology will maximise the potential of widespread uptake and create exciting added value for the project.

164    Dr Vecellio Matteo    University of Basel    2016-10-01    2019-09-30    Characterization of the interaction network of exported proteins in Plasmodium falciparum    The rational to study the interaction network of exported proteins in Plasmodium falciparum lies in the crucial importance of the export of virulence factors to the surface of infected host cells and other modifications allowing the parasite’s survival in its host cell which are the sole cause of morbidity and mortality.P. falciparum, the deadliest form of malaria, exports during its blood cycle over 10% of its proteome into the host cell leading to major host cell modifications such as presentation of adhesins on the surface or change of membrane rigidity and permeability. Why the parasites need to export such large number of proteins is unknown and their interaction is not understood. Only for a small number of proteins a tentative function was determined and hardly any information on exported proteins in the transmission forms, the gametocytes exist.With this project, we aim to elucidate the dynamic interaction network of exported proteins in P. falciparum and their contribution to morbidity during the entire erythrocytic life cycle including gametocytes. Recent technical advances to genetically manipulate P. falciparum make this project more feasible. Using the CRISPR/CAS9 system we will generate knock out parasites of a number of selected exported proteins including a number of PHIST proteins, which were frequently found in the host cell and for which we have shown that they play an important role in anchoring the virulence factor PfEMP1 to the cytoskeleton. With this system but also the alternative selection linked transfection we will generate inducible knock down clones or introduce endogenous tags. All clones will be used for phenotypical analyses using an array of established and innovative methods (e.g. microsphiltration membrane rigidity measures, electron-microscopy for ultrastructural analyses). Protein-protein interaction will be identified using conventional immuno-precipitations but also the BioID system which introduces a promiscuous biotin ligase, which subsequently allows the identification of biotinylated proteins that were in close proximity of the protein of interest. Potential interactions will be confirmed and validated by various techniques such as NMR, fluorescent polarization experiments, fluorescence cross correlation spectroscopy, or split GFP system.We finally expect to obtain through this project an interaction network that is important for Maurer’s cleft function and transport and fixation of PfMP1 on the erythrocyte surface. In particular, we expect clarification of the function of PHIST proteins and their interaction with host cytoskeleton proteins.    Swiss National Science Foundation    Project funding (Div.

Uncontrolled proliferation and maturation arrest are hallmarks of leukemic blasts, the disease-defining cells. Current therapies mainly focus on the deregulated proliferation of blasts; an alternative therapeutic approach is to correct the differentiation defect of leukemia cells and drive the malignant cells into terminal maturation, as successfully exemplified in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a distinct subtype of AML. The overreaching objective of this proposal is to identify and elucidate new targets for differentiation in AML, with the ultimate goal of clinical translation.Specific aims include identification of new differentiation targets using state-of-the-art CRISPR-Cas screening in AML; validation of novel candidate proteins controlling myeloid maturation in multiple models of AML; and understanding the mechanistic role of new AML differentiation targets. This study will uncover a new group of potential therapeutic targets as prime candidates for drug development that will set the stage for future trials assessing differentiation therapies in AML.

In this proposal we strive to unravel how aberrant assembly of protein-RNA complexes may contribute to ALS neuropathology. For this purpose we will analyse the ability of TDP-43, an RNA-binding protein (RBP) commonly associated with ALS, to assemble on RNA transcripts in complex with additional RBPs. We hypothesise that the low complexity region (LCR) of TDP-43 coordinates binding to other RBPs and thereby promotes cooperative RNA interactions. The aim of our study is to elucidate how the composition of TDP-43/RBP complexes influences its affinity and specificity for different RNA binding sites, and thereby affects processing of neurologically relevant transcripts. The successful completion will address basic questions regarding the formation of RNA-protein complexes, and may also uncover new therapeutic avenues for ALS treatment. Our study will involve generation of isogenic cell lines (HEK Flp-In™ and CRISPR/Cas9-edited iPS cells) that will be used for state-of-the-art interaction studies (BioID, APEX, BLI) and development of a variant iCLIP method to elucidate how and where TDP-43 binds transcripts in disease-relevant models. The results of our studies are likely to strongly impact the fields of ALS and hnRNP biology.    Swiss National Science Foundation    Early Postdoc.Mobility    530629.0CHF
167    Dr Vecellio Matteo    University of Zurich    2014-07-01    2017-06-30    TCF and ß-catenin independent outputs of Wingless/Wnt signaling    A small and conserved set of signaling pathways underlies and orchestrates embryonic development and, in the adult, tissue homeostasis. To execute the diverse responses that constitute these processes the biological outputs of the pathways need to be correspondingly diverse. This can be achieved in a number of ways, such as by integrating the inputs of multiple pathways. Another potential mechanism, which has received little attention so far, is the recruitment of additional transcription factors to expand the repertoire of the genetic program that is activated. By additional factors we mean transcription factors other than the archetypal ones, such as the TCF and Gli proteins in the case of Wnt and Hedgehog signaling, respectively. For the Wnt pathway, the central tenet is that its transcriptional output is mediated by the partnership of TCF and ß-catenin; the implicit assumption being that the entire transcriptional output is mediated by TCF and ß-catenin. This belief has never been subjected to a systematic inquisition. In the proposed project we will redress this.Our approach leverages on the fact that it is now practical to routinely measure the transcriptional status of the entire genome. Additionally, novel techniques such as STARR-seq allow us to identify on a genome-wide scale the DNA regulatory regions that are responsive to signaling pathways. Perhaps most crucial of all are avant-garde genome engineering techniques, such as the CRISPR/Cas technique, which enable us to efficiently create genetic mutations - even in multiple genes simultaneously - in cell lines and in animal models. Using a combination of these state of the art techniques we will define the extent to which the transcriptional program triggered by canonical Wnts can bypass ß-catenin and/or TCFs in Drosophila and mammalian model systems. In addition to looking at activated target genes we will also investigate the phenomenon of ligand-dependent repression of target genes.1)We will generate cell lines mutant for TCF and ß-catenin using the CRISPR/Cas technique.2)We will assay the transcriptional changes triggered by the binding of Wnt ligands in these cells.3)We will use techniques such as STARR-seq and ChIP-seq to unearth responsive DNA regulatory regions.The data we generate provides the foundation for mechanistic studies that will elucidate the responsible factors, how these are incorporated into the Wnt pathway and what the biological significance of those side-pathways is during development and in disease. The insights that will be generated will promote the development of more effective therapeutic interventions into diseases where Wnt signaling is deregulated.

168    Dr Vecellio Matteo    Cambridge Institute for Medical Research University of Cambridge Cambridge Biomedical Campus    2016-06-01    2018-05-31    Identification, characterization and targeting of efflux pumps in Mycobacterium abscessus    Background: The prevalence of Mycobacterium abscessus, a rapidly growing non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) is increasing in the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) population. As a result of multidrug resistance, M. abscessus causes a chronic incurable infection in most CF patients and represents a major emerging threat to their health. Several efflux pumps have been identified in M. tuberculosis, where they have been proposed to impair mycobacterial killing, to cause macrophage-induced drug tolerance and may also promote mycobacterial growth in absence of anti-mycobacterial drugs. Inhibiting efflux pumps may thus favourably improve both, mycobacterial killing and drug susceptibility. Efflux pump inhibitors in combination with anti-mycobacterial drugs could potentially increase the number of effective drugs available and reduce treatment duration (currently averaging at over 2 years). However, the role and function of efflux pumps in M. abscessus is at present unknown.Aim 1: Identification of putative efflux pumps in M. abscessusApproach: Whole genome sequencing data of more than 1900 clinical isolates of M. abscessus is available at the CIMR / WTSI. All putative efflux pumps will be identified based on sequence homology. Furthermore polymorphisms will be assessed. Estimates indicate that M. abscessus has about 30-35 potential efflux pump genes. Genetic data will be correlated with clinical metadata to determine whether specific mutations are associated with clinical outcome and treatment response.Relevance: Putative efflux pumps of M. abscessus and their polymorphisms will be identified and associated with markers of clinical outcome. Aim 2: Characterisation of putative efflux pumps in M. abscessus Approach: Identified genes of putative M. abscessus efflux pumps will be knocked out using the CRISPR/Cas9 platform. Wild type and efflux pump knockout M. abscessus mutants will be challenged with anti-mycobacterial drugs and bacterial killing assessed, in broth culture and after macrophage infection. Relevance: Major efflux pumps affecting mycobacterial killing and tolerance will be identified using established high throughput methods of genetic editing and phenotypic analysis.Aim 3: Pharmacological inhibition of efflux pumps Approach: Specific and efficacious inhibitors of major efflux pumps in M. abscessus will be identified and tested in culture and macrophage experiments. Relevance: Efflux pump inhibitor plus anti-mycobacterial drug combinations that improve M. abscessus killing will be identified.Aim 4: Characterisation of the efflux pump expression in M. abscessusApproach: Efflux pumps will be tagged with fluorescent proteins using CRISPR/Cas9. Macrophages will be infected with M. abscessus GFP knockin mutants. The temporal dynamics of efflux pump expression will be assessed using live cell confocal fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry Relevance: Efflux pump expression in M. abscessus upon macrophage infection will be assessed and, in future, potentially manipulated.

169    Dr Vecellio Matteo    Center for Cancer Research Massachusetts Institute of Technology    2015-01-01    2016-06-30    Understanding the mechanism of metastatic dissemination in small cell lung cancer    Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive and clinically intractable subtype of lung cancer. Despite intensive treatment, widespread metastases are often unavoidable and the long-term prognosis is dismal in SCLC patients. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of SCLC metastatic dissemination will be the cornerstone for developing novel and more effective treatment. To facilitate dissecting the mechanism of SCLC pathogenesis, a genetically-engineered mouse model (GEMM) of SCLC has been developed, which bears close resemblance with human SCLC both in their genetic deregulation and in their highly metastatic nature. Herein, we propose the utility of this GEMM to identify driver mutations for metastasis. We will first harvest tumors from primary sites and from metastatic lesions, then perform exome sequencing to identify subclones in primary tumors which give rise to metastasis, followed by RNA sequencing to identify gene signatures associated with these metastatic subclones. Once the candidates are obtained, we will screen with the transplant model, by inoculating the mSCLC cell lines harboring a luciferase reporter allele into immunocompromised mice after manipulating the expression of interested genes. After subcutaneous tumor transplantation, the metastasis formation will be closely followed up by luminescence signals. Finally, we will validate selected genes from the screening and perform in vivo editing of these genes in the GEMM by the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, and follow up by microCT/MRI to assess if the burden of SCLC metastasis could be altered. With this project, we aim to identify and validate mutations driving SCLC metastasis, in the hope of developing new treatment strategies against such formidable disease.

170    Dr Vecellio Matteo    Cantonal hospital of St.Gallen    2017-09-01    2017-11-30    Identification of the genes conferring susceptibility to nelfinavir by genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen    Proteasome inhibitors (PI) have evolved as central backbone for treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) and have significantly contributed to improved patient outcomes. However, the majority of MM patients that respond initially to proteasome inhibitor therapy develop resistance over the course of their disease, and ultimately die from PI-refractory MM. In a multicenter national phase II clinical trial performed within the SAKK, we have identified the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir as a drug with unprecedented clinical activity in PI-refractory MM (Driessen, 2016, ASH abstract 487). The molecular target and mechanism of nelfinavir activity against PI-refractory MM are unknown. Our unpublished preclinical data identify ER-resident chaperones, transmembrane transporters and mitochondria-related proteins as nelfinavir-binding targets and pinpoint the mechanism of action of nelfinavir to interference with ER-based protein transport or folding and energy metabolism.With the current proposal, we shall identify key cellular mechanisms affecting susceptibility of MM and PI-refractory MM to nelfinavir treatment using CRISPR-Cas9 genome-wide loss-of-function screening. To validate the role of certain candidate genes in nelfinavir sensitivity/resistance, selected candidates from the primary screen will be individually knocked-out using the targeted CRISPR-Cas9 approach. Such data are required from the international scientific community to support the development of nelfinavir towards clinical availability for MM, possibly outside the commercial setting. Our group is globally in the leading position to elaborate these.    Swiss National Science Foundation    Scientific Exchanges    4500.0CHF
171    Dr Vecellio Matteo    ETH Zurich    2015-11-01    2018-10-31    CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene therapy in liver stem cell organoids    We have recently established methods for in vitro long-term expansion of human adult liver stem cells. When provided with the proper growth factors, these stem cells grow into polarized epithelia which consist of proliferating stem cells and postmitotic differentiated cells. Importantly, stem cells in organoid cultures are genotypically and phenotypically stable, and can be genetically modified using genome editing tools. In addition, when orthotopically transplanted into mouse models they can readily integrate and generate functional epithelia, suggesting that organoids are promising for ex vivo gene therapy approaches.In a proof-of-concept work we recently corrected disease-causing CFTR alleles in intestinal organoids derived from cystic fibrosis patients using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool. However, although functionality of the repaired receptor could be demonstrated in in vitro assays, we did not proceed towards clinical application for the reason that cystic fibrosis is a multi-organ disease in which stem cells of several epithelial tissues would need to be replaced. Importantly, this hurdle does not exist for most metabolic liver diseases, in which the correction of the disease causing allele solely in hepatocytes would be sufficient to cure the specific syndrome. In addition, hepatocyte transplantations have been already successfully performed in the clinics as an alternative to whole liver transplantations.For these reasons we decided to focus on establishing an ex vivo clinical-grade gene therapy approach for inherited metabolic disorders in the liver. In particular, we will focus on Urea Cycle Disorder (UCD), which is an inborn monogenetic disease caused by the deficiency of one of the urea cycle enzymes. Our goal is to tackle UCD with an ex vivo gene therapy approach, in which liver organoids from patient biopsies will be established, repaired by CRISPR/Cas9, differentiated into hepatocytes which can be transplanted back into the patient liver to restore sufficient enzyme activity    Swiss National Science Foundation    MD-PhD fellowships (funded by SNSF)    180000.0CHF
172    Dr Vecellio Matteo    Donelly Centre for Cellular + Biomolecular Research University of Toronto    2016-01-01    2017-06-30    Identification of genetic networks required for reprogramming of cancer cells in response to metabolic stress using next-generation CRISPR-Cas9 screens    A hallmark of cancer is the reprogramming of cellular metabolism in order to fuel growth and division. However, the rapid proliferation of cancer cells leads to several environmental stress conditions such as acidosis, hypoxia or local nutrient deprivation. In order to successfully establish tumor formation and metastasis cancer cells need to adapt to these harsh conditions and are required to rapidly reprogram gene expression in order to survive. The proposed research aims to identify the sensors and regulators of environmental stress conditions such as nutrient deprivation. Towards this goal genetic screens using the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas9 technology will be performed under various growth conditions and in different genetic backgrounds. The work of our lab and others have demonstrated that CRISPR-Cas9 gene knockout screens have the potential to discover near complete genetic pathways and are therefore expected to reveal regulators of stress-induced reprogramming at unprecedented depth. Candidate genes will be functionally characterized using biochemical assays and gene expression data. The unique combination of genetic screens, gene expression profiles and focused biochemical assays is expected to provide novel insight into the molecular mechanism of the reprogramming events required for cancer cells to adapt to metabolic stress conditions. Furthermore, the proposed research may reveal novel cancer therapeutic targets by highlighting genetic vulnerabilities associated with cellular metabolism.

173    Dr Vecellio Matteo    University of Zurich    2016-10-01    2019-09-30    Regulation of nucleotide excision repair by histone methyltransferases    Our aim is to understand how histone methyltransferases regulate DNA damage recognition by the global-genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) machinery in human cells.Background: Maintenance of genome stability is essential to prevent cancer and premature aging. GG-NER is a versatile “big enzyme” machine that safeguards the genome by removing bulky DNA adducts induced by genotoxic agents like UV light, chemical carcinogens, chemotherapeutic drugs and oxygen radicals. To be effective, this repair machine must cope with the condensation of its chromatin substrate where DNA is tightly wrapped around histones giving rise to nucleosome arrays. Our preceding work provides strong evidence for a novel role of the histone methyltransferase KMT2H in GG-NER reactions in chromatin. Working hypothesis:- Chromatin cannot simply be considered as an accessibility barrier but contributes to the damage response by priming damaged sites for DNA repair activities.- Three main molecular factors prime chromatin for DNA repair: histone modifications, histone variants and ATP-dependent remodeling.- Histone methyltransferases are key modifiers promoting DNA damage recognition in the GG-NER process.Specific aims: This project is focused on how histone methyltransferases regulate GG-NER reactions in the packed human genome. We will analyze GG-NER activity in living cells to determine the role of (i) methyltransferases that add chromatin-relaxing methyl groups to histones (for example to H3 at position K4) (ii) methyltransferases that add chromatin-condensing methyl groups to histones (for example to H3K9), (iii) chromatin remodelers like the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) family known to be recruited or activated by histone methylation. Experimental design: We established activity assays and fluorescence-based imaging methods to monitor NER reactions in human cells. For screening, histone-modifying enzymes will be down regulated using RNA interference. For confirmatory and mechanistic studies, we will employ cells with CRISPR/cas9-induced gene deletions or mutations. The assembly of GG-NER complexes will be evidence in situ by visualizing the relocation of repair subunits to UV lesion spots. To study the assembly of GG-NER complexes in the nucleosome landscape, chromatin will be solubilized and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against histones/modified histones. Composition of immunoprecipitates will be analyzed by targeted (immunoblotting) and untargeted (mass spectrometry) methods. Supporting flow cytometry experiments, cytotoxicity tests, colony-forming and comet assays will be performed for cell cycle, viability and genome stability analyses.Expected value: Due to the very high frequency of damages that the GG-NER machine needs to process simultaneously (hundred thousand or more DNA lesions in a single genome), this reaction provides a unique model system to understand how nucleosome dynamics and DNA accessibility are regulated on a global scale in the chromatin of human cells. This project, therefore, paves the way to novel pharmacologic strategies that stimulate or inhibit nucleosome fluctuations using emerging methyltransferase or demethylase inhibitors, particularly with the intent of sensitizing cancer cells to radio- or chemotherapy.

174    Dr Vecellio Matteo    University of Lausanne    2016-04-01    2019-03-31    Gene editing for Huntington's disease    Huntington’s disease (HD) is a rare neurodegenerative disease caused by a pathologic CAG expansion in the exon 1 of the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Aggregation and abnormal functions of the mutant HTT (mHTT) cause motor, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms in patients, which lead to death in 15-20 years. Currently, there are no curative treatments for HD but experimental approaches based on drug, cell and gene therapy are under investigation. Among them, mHTT silencing using small hairpin RNA (shRNA) displays important physiopathological benefits but requires long-term and continuous treatment and is leading to a partial HTT silencing. The recently described method based on the bacterial clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system is a promising tool for gene editing in mammals and offers a unique opportunity to investigate a therapeutic strategy based on DNA modifications. In this project, we propose to use the CRISPR technology for gene editing and repair of HD mutation. Both, in vitro and in vivo experiments will be performed to validate various strategies of mHTT gene editing.

176    Dr Zhao Bin    Zheijang University    2016-03-01    None    The role of Hippo signaling spatial dynamics in organ size control and cancer    Organ size determination is one of the most intriguing unsolved mysteries in biology. In recent years, the Hippo signaling pathway was found to play an evolutionarily conserved key role in organ size determination through regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis and stemness. More importantly, deregulation of the Hippo pathway underlies tumorigenesis of many human cancers. In response to signals such as mechanical stress, the Hippo pathway Mst1/2-Lats1/2 kinase cascade phosphorylates and inhibits YAP and TAZ transcription co-activators, therefore regulates gene expression and tissue growth. Nevertheless, the subcellular localization of Hippo signaling is largely unknown. In this project, through collaborative efforts, we will tag all endogenous Hippo pathway proteins using CRISPR-mediated homologous recombination in both mammalian cells and Drosophila. This resource will allow mechanistic and functional analysis of subcellular spatial dynamics of Hippo pathway proteins upon physiological stimulation and during development or regeneration. The proposed work will not only address an important albeit obscure area of Hippo signaling and organ size control but will also demonstrate the general value of CRISPR-mediated protein tagging technique in solving the long-standing difficulty of cell signaling spatial dynamics investigation. This work will also open new directions for investigating the Hippo pathway in human cancer and regenerative medicine.    The Academy of Medical Sciences    None    111000.0GBP

178    Professor Qasim Waseem    University of Lausanne    2017-10-01    2019-09-30    Manipulating trinucleotide repeat instability    Expanded CAG/CTG repeat instability is a hallmark of 14 different neurological diseases. Longer repeat tracts in the germlines cause more severe phenotypes in the offspring of patients, whereas the bias towards repeat expansion in somatic tissues is thought to accelerate the progression of these diseases. Thus, uncovering the molecular mechanisms of CAG repeat expansion will help our understanding of the cause of expanded CAG/CTG repeat diseases. Moreover, contracting the repeat tract would remove the underlying cause of the disease and potentially provide a much needed therapeutic avenue. The goal of this grant, therefore, is to better understand CAG/CTG repeat instability such that we can eventually manipulate it. We focus on the role of local chromatin structure and folding in the instability process. We will also pursue a CRISPR-Cas9-based method that we have recently developed that specifically induces repeat contraction. We will profit from our expertise in culture cell lines, molecular genetics, and genome editing to move into disease models, in particular using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Specifically we will ask:1) Does HDAC5 induce expansions in patient-derived iPSCs and worsen the cellular phenotypes?2) Does chromatin folding at expanded CAG repeats contribute to repeat instability?3) Can the Cas9 nickase reverse cellular and behavioral phenotypes in disease models?

Transcriptional control during embryogenesis is extremely dynamic and recent evidence indicates that often several enhancers participate in driving gene expression in a tissue-specific manner. An ideal experimental model to approach these questions is the mouse embryonic limb, as the genetic mechanisms controlling its morphogenesis are well known. In particular, my PhD studies are focused on the study of the transcriptional regulation of Ptch1, which encodes the main receptor of the SHH ligand during limb development. The SHH pathway is essential for morphogenesis of diverse embryonic tissues, including the limb, and its deregulation contributes to tumorigenesis and human congenital malformations. During the period funded by the Doc.Mobility fellowship, I propose to approach two different aspects concerning Ptch1 regulation: (1) I will define the regulatory robustness of the mechanisms controlling Ptch1 expression in the mouse limb bud by using a loss-of-function strategy that takes advantage of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology; (2) I will address the mechanisms by which mouse limb bud cells are able to detect graded SHH signaling and elaborate a transcriptional response accordingly. To do so, I will use a transgenic reporter setup in which the affinity of the transcription factor motifs within a SHH-responding enhancer can be altered and the functional consequences evaluated in a straightforward manner. In summary, the research proposed here will advance our understanding on how the SHH pathway, with essential functions in development and disease, is regulated and interpreted at the transcriptional level.

184    Dr Quek Lynn Swun    University of Oxford    2017-09-18    2021-03-18    Reducing the animal cost of CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis    Genetically altered (GA) mouse models provide a powerful means of attributing function to DNA sequences. As investigations of how DNA variation and mutation contributes to disease advance, demand for GA mouse models increases. Recently, this demand has been aided by the new CRISPR/Cas9 technology, an RNA guided nuclease system, which permits the production of models at unprecedented efficiencies. Already the biomedical community is applying this new technology widely for mouse model production. Meanwhile, the 3Rs impact of the technology remains unexplored. This proposal seeks to address aspects of the technology that, our experience shows, can lead to substantial increases in mouse usage and wasted production of undesirable genotypes. Following CRISPR/Cas9 microinjection into mouse zygotes, the founders generated are invariably mosaic, due to the persistence of the nuclease after the first cleavage event. Founders must be bred extensively to ensure transmission of the desired allele, increasing mouse usage. The mosaicism also precludes the phenotyping of the founder generation, which, given the high efficiencies of CRISPR/Cas9 might be feasible for certain phenotypic screens. We plan to explore whether the use of Cas9 fusions with destabilizing or cell-cycle regulatory domains can be used to confine nuclease activity to the 1-cell stage and thus eliminate mosaicism. Furthermore, the mode of Cas9 supply, protein or maternally contributed via transgenic Cas9 overexpression will be investigated for its impact on mosaicism. As a potential refinement, methods to address and limit deleterious indel mutagenesis during knock-in mice production, a class of model particularly sought after for interrogating disease-related mutation, will be investigated. Whether the mode of nuclease delivery, the use of cell cycle-regulated Cas9 and co-injection of wild-type repair templates can impact the rate of indel mutation at the non-targeted allele will be assessed.

185    Dr. NOWIKOVSKY Karin    Medical University of Vienna    2016-08-01    2019-03-31    Analysis of the LETM1 Protein Family in the Development of Zebrafish    LETM1 encodes a conserved protein with crucial functions in maintaining the mitochondrial volume and ion homeostasis. LETM1 is associated with the Wolf-Hirschhorn Syndrome (WHS), a severe childhood disorder with congenital anomalies and intellectual disability. Seizures in WHS patients strongly correlate with LETM1 haploinsufficiency. The implication of LETM1 and thus, mitochondrial dysfunctions, in the pathogenesis of seizures; coupled to the crucial role of mitochondrial functions for the neuronal membrane excitability, led us to propose studying LETM1 in the developmental model system Danio rerio. We propose to investigate for the first time the role of letm1 and its homologue letm2 in Danio rerio, a strong model for vertebrate development. We aim to clarify when and where letm1 and letm2 are active during the early development of the zebrafish. To further determine the letm1/ letm2 knockout phenotypes, we generated TALEN and Crispr/Cas9 mediated letm1 and letm2 knockout fish lines. Aiming at a basic understanding of the biological role of letm1 and mitochondrial osmoregulation in the early development of the zebrafish with particular focus on the brain function, we will study embryonic and neuronal mitochondrial functions with regard to K+-H+ exchange and Ca2+ activity as well as locomotory behaviour, epileptogenic signals and design strategies to rescue the observed phenotypes. We will ask if letm2 plays a similar or different role as compared to letm1. The proposed study is expected to reveal if and how letm1 and potentially letm2 caused mitochondrial dysfunctions impede the early development and the nervous system activity in the zebrafish and establish a disease model for seizures in the WHS for future drug screenings.

186    Dr. LÖTSCH Daniela    Medical University of Vienna    2018-04-01    2021-03-31    TERT promoter mutations and cancer aggressiveness    One major hallmark of tumour cells represents the stabilisation of telomeres as prerequisite for unlimited cell division and proliferation. Accordingly, up to 90% of both haematological and solid malignancies including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and malignant pleura mesothelioma (MPM) exhibit telomerase re-activation. Non-coding mutations in the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) core promoter have been discovered with high prevalence across defined cancer types strengthening the importance of telomerase hyper-activation during malignant transformation and progression. Indeed, several studies including our own have already proven an association of TERT promoter mutations with enhanced gene expression and dismal prognosis in GBM and melanoma. However, the underlying biological mechanisms causing worse outcome are widely speculative so far. Thus this project follows the hypothesis that presence of a TERT promoter mutation and consequently TERT overexpression facilitates a more aggressive type of malignant progression irrespective of the affected tissue or cell type. Accordingly, we aim to elucidate on a comparative basis, the impact of TERT promoter mutations and its interaction with a nearby single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs2853669) on cancer cell aggressiveness in GBM and further confirm promising results in MPM. Moreover, we hypothesize that these genomic TERT promoter variants have an impact on secondary DNA structures and alter the sensitivity of malignant cells towards TERT promoter targeting by quadruplex stabilising agents. To validate these hypotheses we will use the following approaches: 1) Comparison of cell biological differences (growth, migration, stem cell properties and therapy response) between TERT promoter wild-type and mutated GBM cell lines and isogenic cell models (generated by CRISPR/Cas9 technology and thus only differing with regard to the TERT promoter mutation status). 2) Investigation of TERT promoter activity using luciferase reporter constructs containing wild-type or mutated sequence with our without the rs2853669 SNP. These experiments will be performed in cell models of GBM and MPM with variable endogenous TERT promoter sequences and compared to isogenic cell lines of each entity. 3) Dissection of transcription factor (TF) recruitment to different TERT promoter variants in GBM (DNA/protein pulldown followed by shot-gun proteomics mass-spectrometry in comparison to chromatin immunoprecipitation). 4) Knock-down of the most promising TF and impact on telomerase stability, promoter activity and on non-canonical TERT functions including NF-?B and WNT pathway activation. 5) Comparison of gene expression patterns in cell models of GBM harbouring a differing TERT promoter status and extraction of altered signatures using systems biology approaches (GEO, GORILLA, GSEA). 6) Analysing the impact of the TERT promoter status on sensitivity towards experimental telomerase inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. The project will be performed by the applicant (Daniela Lötsch) in close collaboration with clinical partners (Departments of Neurosurgery and Thoracic Surgery in Vienna and Linz) and collaboration partners abroad (Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology; DKFZ-Heidelberg and Medicinal and Bioinorganic Chemistry, Cardiff, UK).

187    Professor Evans Jeffry    University of Glasgow    2015-07-01    2020-06-30    Translational Cancer Therapeutics    BackgroundPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a poor prognosis and novel pre-clinical and clinical approaches are required to develop more effective strategies to treat pre-invasive, micro-metastatic, and advanced disease. We have developed a number of novel genetically-engineered murine models (and cell lines from these tumours) that have allowed us to understand the biological function of key tumour suppressor genes and oncogenes in vivo in both normal tissues and tumours, allowed us to identify and characterise the signalling pathways that are deregulated at the early stages of pancreatic cancer, during the development and progression of the invasive and metastatic phenotype, and that are potential therapeutic targets in advanced disease. AimsThe aim of our work is to determine how potential anti-cancer agents might best be evaluated in subsequent clinical trials in PDAC. Specifically, we will (a) investigate key pathways downstream of KRAS to develop therapies in advanced disease. We will focus on the mTOR pathway, to explore which downstream targets are important for tumour cell survival and proliferation, identify in which genetic backgrounds that target inhibition will have most efficacy, and to pre-clinically test inhibitors and combinatorial approaches(b) optimize therapy in localised disease by targeting myeloid cells to suppress metastasis and to improve immunotherapy. We will investigate the key immune cell types and signals in the PDAC microenvironment and how they impinge on immune suppression, and assess how best to modulate tumour immunity in vivo, with regards to rational combinations. Initially, we will focus on inhibition of CXCR2 or CSF1R to enhance T-cell tumour infiltration and increases anti-PD1 efficacy.MethodsWe will use clinically relevant inhibitors, shRNA or CRISPR / Cas9 technology to inhibit candidate targets in cell lines from appropriate mouse models. Analysis by qPCR or immunoblotting will be performed to validate the mechanism of action of successful candidates and to identify companion biomarkers for future clinical studies. We will use our mouse models for genetic validation and to assess the efficacy of candidate therapies or combinations, using PET imaging to assess therapeutic efficacy with regard to tumour metabolism and proliferation where relevant. We will identify potential genotype-specific biomarker signatures in murine models and confirm the clinical relevance of these in human tissue microarrays, which can then be used to guide patient selection in subsequent clinical studies.We will use the results of these studies to develop clinical trials in patients with PDAC.

188    Dr Zelenay Santiago    University of Manchester    2015-08-01    2022-07-31    Manchester Immunology Group    Identification and characterisation of mediators of tumour promoting or inhibitory inflammation: The notion of immune-based control of cancer has historically been controversial but has gained great support from the remarkable clinical success of certain types of immunotherapy over the past few years. This is certainly the case of melanoma, where some patients have shown complete and durable responses upon treatment with immune checkpoint blocking antibodies. Also promising results were obtained in treatment-refractory cancers such as metastatic non-small-cell lung carcinoma, a type of cancer that until recently was considered as unresponsive to immunotherapy. Nevertheless, in all cases, only a fraction of patients responds underscoring the need for mechanistic studies to determine why this is the case. Indeed, how tumours evade natural and therapy-induced immune responses is a long-standing question in cancer biology. The concept that cancer induces inflammation and that inflammatory cells at the tumour site promote several key aspects of malignant tumours such as proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis or migration, is well established. On the other hand, some types of inflammation such as the one characterised by T cell infiltration, particularly by cytotoxic T cells, are associated with a favourable prognosis and clinical benefit. Moreover, effective anti-tumour immunity depends on inflammatory mediators that contribute to the activation of immune cells such as dendritic cells. Together, these observations indicate that cancer-associated inflammation can have both tumour-promoting and inhibitory effects. How different types of inflammation are manipulated by a growing tumour and to what extent this constitutes an opportunity for therapeutic intervention remains incompletely explored. In this context, our group investigates the mechanisms by which cancer cells trigger the immune system and simultaneously evade anti-tumour immunity. The aim of this project will be to identify and characterise factors that modulate the function of immune cells such as dendritic cells in the tumour microenvironment, distinguishing mediators promoting anti-tumour immunity from those that support tumour growth. Building on from our recent work (Zelenay et al. Cell 2015), the successful candidate will evaluate how specific genetic mutations in cancer cells impact in their ability to modulate the recruitment and function of immune cells through a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches. These will include implementing CRISPR-Cas9 technology for genome editing of cancer cells bearing defined combinations of oncogenic mutations, the use of genetically-engineered transplantable and autochthonous mouse models of cancer and the analysis of samples from cancer patients.

189    Dr. DIMCHEV Georgi    INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AUSTRIA    2018-07-01    2020-06-30    Protein structure and function in filopodia across scales    Filopodia are dynamic protrusions extending from the cell periphery, acting as sensory organelles in migration, adhesion, neuronal guidance and wound healing. They are also linked to pathological conditions, such as cancer and viral infections. Filopodia consist of actin filaments that are spatially organized into bundles by actin bundling proteins. Various combinations of bundling proteins are expressed in different cell types, but their specific function and potential redundancy has remained enigmatic. Many actin-regulating proteins in filopodia and other cellular compartments have been studied on the cellular level, examining their influence on cell morphology and dynamics. Understanding filopodial proteins at an ultra-structural level in their native context is another promising approach to deciphering their role. However, for most proteins structural in situ information is unavailable, due to experimental challenges. Our proposal aims to reveal the detailed function and redundancy of actin filament bundlers in filopodia across scales, from the cellular level, down to the scale of individual proteins. We want to correlate protein structure with its role in cell morphology and filopodial morphodynamics, all within the same experimental system. We will generate CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic knockouts of Fascin1, Daam1 and Fimbrin in B16-F1 cells and characterise them on the cellular and ultrastructural level. Live imaging microscopy and sophisticated image analysis will reveal changes in morphodynamical parameters upon knocking out proteins. Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) is a powerful method to provide three-dimensional insights into complex cellular environments, and will be performed to acquire the ultrastructure of filopodia. This will reveal how the density and distribution of filopodial proteins and the actin network organization is affected upon loss of the targeted proteins. Novel image processing techniques (i.e. subtomogram averaging) will be then used to retrieve high-resolution structural information on filopodial proteins within their native environment. Acquiring high-resolution structural information on proteins in their native environment and linking this to morphodynamical parameters will be a significant breakthrough towards a holistic cellular structural biology approach. The project will significantly advance our knowledge on filopodia formation, maintenance and the functional redundancy of bundling proteins. The applicant Georgi Dimchev is an expert in studying actin-mediated cell migration using cell biology methods and imaging techniques. His expertise perfectly complements that within the research group of Florian Schur (co-applicant) at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria, where the applicant intends to address the above-mentioned questions. The Schur lab employs and develops correlative live-cell imaging, cryo-ET and subtomogram averaging methods to study the structure of the actin cytoskeleton in situ.

However, the full scope of benefits that these systems can provide, as well as their costs remain unknown. Specifically, it is unclear whether the benefits against viral infection outweigh the continual costs incurred even in the absence of parasitic elements, and whether CRISPR-Cas systems affect microbial genome diversity in nature. Since CRISPR-Cas systems can impede lateral gene transfer, it is often assumed that they reduce genetic diversity. Conversely, our recent results suggest the exact opposite: that these systems generate a high level of genomic diversity within populations. We have recently combined genomics of environmental strains and experimental genetics to show that archaea frequently acquire CRISPR immune memory, known as spacers, from chromosomes of related species in the environment. The presence of these spacers reduces gene exchange between lineages, indicating that CRISPR-Cas contributes to diversification. We have also shown that such inter-species mating events induce the acquisition of spacers against a strain's own replicons, supporting a role for CRISPR-Cas systems in generating deletions in natural plasmids and unessential genomic loci, again increasing genome diversity within populations. Here we aim to test our hypothesis that CRISPR-Cas systems increase within-population diversity, and quantify their benefits to both cells and populations, using large-scale genomics and experimental evolution. We will explore how these systems alter the patterns of recombination within and between species, and explore the potential involvement of CRISPR-associated proteins in cellular DNA repair. This work will reveal the eco-evolutionary role of CRISPR-Cas systems in shaping microbial populations, and open new research avenues regarding additional roles beyond anti-viral defense.

To elucidate the mechanism by which RA-associated SNPs alter their target genes. Regulatory elements containing disease-associated SNPs will be identified in primary cells from patients and their functional importance will be verified using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. 3. To translate research findings into patient benefit.

196    Dr An Jing    Xi’an Jiaotong University    2019-03-01    2021-02-28    Towards CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene correction for inherited retinal disease    Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders caused by monogenic mutation of >250 genes, and together, they are a major cause of blindness. Recent advances in gene therapy research forecast a bright future for IRD treatment. Retina has distinct advantages for gene therapy because of its small confined space, easy accessibility by surgery, and immune privilege. The FDA in the US has recently approved the first ever gene therapy for treating an IRD (by overexpression of the normal gene). But this popular gene supplementation approach has its weaknesses, e.g. the co-existing influence of the mutant gene and therefore is not suitable for all IRDs. The newly emerged CRISPR/Cas9 technology enables highly specific in-situ gene editing, heralding a new era for developing gene therapy for IRDs. Cacna1f gene encodes a retina abundant Cav1.4 channel protein and mutations in this gene can cause the incomplete congenital stationary night blindness (iCSNB) in human. My current lab identified a spontaneous single mutation in rat Cacna1f gene responsible for iCSNB-like phenotypes in rats. We tested gene supplementation therapy in these rats by overexpressing the wild type Cacna1f gene in the retina, but detected no significant change in visual function. Therefore we will next turn to the CRISPR/Cas9 technology for Cacna1f gene correction. In this proposed project, taking advantage of the UK co-applicant’s extensive experience in mouse gene manipulation, we aim to examine the feasibility and efficacy of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Cacna1f gene correction in Cav1.4 IT mice, which feature a CACNA1F-I756T mutation and reflect very well the functional phenotype seen in human patients with a corresponding CACNA1F-I745T mutation. We will make AAV-based Cas9 and sgRNA constructs designed to cleave target DNA near the genomic site corresponding to CACNA1F-I756T and assess them in 3T3 cells to find the most efficient CRISPR/Cas9 system for DNA cleavage. We will further evaluate CRISPR/Cas9-mediated precise gene editing in 3T3 cells using a donor template of Cacna1f containing an edit. Then we will construct a donor template of wild type Cacna1f (of the same design as the one above) for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene correction in the retina of Cav1.4 IT mice. We will also use a donor template of Cacna1f containing an insertion of Tdtom cassette for easy examination of gene editing efficiency. If acquired data are promising, we will further assess the therapeutic effect of the above gene correction in Cav1.4 IT mice.

We tested gene supplementation therapy in these rats by overexpressing the wild type Cacna1f gene in the retina, but detected no significant change in visual function. Therefore we will next turn to the CRISPR/Cas9 technology for Cacna1f gene correction. In this proposed project, taking advantage of the UK co-applicant’s extensive experience in mouse gene manipulation, we aim to examine the feasibility and efficacy of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Cacna1f gene correction in Cav1.4 IT mice, which feature a CACNA1F-I756T mutation and reflect very well the functional phenotype seen in human patients with a corresponding CACNA1F-I745T mutation. We will make AAV-based Cas9 and sgRNA constructs designed to cleave target DNA near the genomic site corresponding to CACNA1F-I756T and assess them in 3T3 cells to find the most efficient CRISPR/Cas9 system for DNA cleavage. We will further evaluate CRISPR/Cas9-mediated precise gene editing in 3T3 cells using a donor template of Cacna1f containing an edit. Then we will construct a donor template of wild type Cacna1f (of the same design as the one above) for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene correction in the retina of Cav1.4 IT mice. We will also use a donor template of Cacna1f containing an insertion of Tdtom cassette for easy examination of gene editing efficiency. If acquired data are promising, we will further assess the therapeutic effect of the above gene correction in Cav1.4 IT mice.    Medical Research Council    Unit    3.52671E+7INR
200    Dion Vincent    University of Lausanne    2017-10-01    2019-09-30    Manipulating trinucleotide repeat instability    Expanded CAG/CTG repeat instability is a hallmark of 14 different neurological diseases. Longer repeat tracts in the germlines cause more severe phenotypes in the offspring of patients, whereas the bias towards repeat expansion in somatic tissues is thought to accelerate the progression of these diseases. Thus, uncovering the molecular mechanisms of CAG repeat expansion will help our understanding of the cause of expanded CAG/CTG repeat diseases. Moreover, contracting the repeat tract would remove the underlying cause of the disease and potentially provide a much needed therapeutic avenue. The goal of this grant, therefore, is to better understand CAG/CTG repeat instability such that we can eventually manipulate it. We focus on the role of local chromatin structure and folding in the instability process. We will also pursue a CRISPR-Cas9-based method that we have recently developed that specifically induces repeat contraction. We will profit from our expertise in culture cell lines, molecular genetics, and genome editing to move into disease models, in particular using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Specifically we will ask:1) Does HDAC5 induce expansions in patient-derived iPSCs and worsen the cellular phenotypes?2) Does chromatin folding at expanded CAG repeats contribute to repeat instability?3) Can the Cas9 nickase reverse cellular and behavioral phenotypes in disease models?

Transcriptional control during embryogenesis is extremely dynamic and recent evidence indicates that often several enhancers participate in driving gene expression in a tissue-specific manner. An ideal experimental model to approach these questions is the mouse embryonic limb, as the genetic mechanisms controlling its morphogenesis are well known. In particular, my PhD studies are focused on the study of the transcriptional regulation of Ptch1, which encodes the main receptor of the SHH ligand during limb development. The SHH pathway is essential for morphogenesis of diverse embryonic tissues, including the limb, and its deregulation contributes to tumorigenesis and human congenital malformations. During the period funded by the Doc.Mobility fellowship, I propose to approach two different aspects concerning Ptch1 regulation: (1) I will define the regulatory robustness of the mechanisms controlling Ptch1 expression in the mouse limb bud by using a loss-of-function strategy that takes advantage of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology; (2) I will address the mechanisms by which mouse limb bud cells are able to detect graded SHH signaling and elaborate a transcriptional response accordingly. To do so, I will use a transgenic reporter setup in which the affinity of the transcription factor motifs within a SHH-responding enhancer can be altered and the functional consequences evaluated in a straightforward manner. In summary, the research proposed here will advance our understanding on how the SHH pathway, with essential functions in development and disease, is regulated and interpreted at the transcriptional level.

LETM1 is associated with the Wolf-Hirschhorn Syndrome (WHS), a severe childhood disorder with congenital anomalies and intellectual disability.

The implication of LETM1 and thus, mitochondrial dysfunctions, in the pathogenesis of seizures; coupled to the crucial role of mitochondrial functions for the neuronal membrane excitability, led us to propose studying LETM1 in the developmental model system Danio rerio. We propose to investigate for the first time the role of letm1 and its homologue letm2 in Danio rerio, a strong model for vertebrate development. We aim to clarify when and where letm1 and letm2 are active during the early development of the zebrafish. To further determine the letm1/ letm2 knockout phenotypes, we generated TALEN and Crispr/Cas9 mediated letm1 and letm2 knockout fish lines. Aiming at a basic understanding of the biological role of letm1 and mitochondrial osmoregulation in the early development of the zebrafish with particular focus on the brain function, we will study embryonic and neuronal mitochondrial functions with regard to K+-H+ exchange and Ca2+ activity as well as locomotory behaviour, epileptogenic signals and design strategies to rescue the observed phenotypes. We will ask if letm2 plays a similar or different role as compared to letm1. The proposed study is expected to reveal if and how letm1 and potentially letm2 caused mitochondrial dysfunctions impede the early development and the nervous system activity in the zebrafish and establish a disease model for seizures in the WHS for future drug screenings.

207    Dr. LÖTSCH Daniela    Medical University of Vienna    2018-04-01    2021-03-31    TERT promoter mutations and cancer aggressiveness    One major hallmark of tumour cells represents the stabilisation of telomeres as prerequisite for unlimited cell division and proliferation. Accordingly, up to 90% of both haematological and solid malignancies including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and malignant pleura mesothelioma (MPM) exhibit telomerase re-activation. Non-coding mutations in the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) core promoter have been discovered with high prevalence across defined cancer types strengthening the importance of telomerase hyper-activation during malignant transformation and progression. Indeed, several studies including our own have already proven an association of TERT promoter mutations with enhanced gene expression and dismal prognosis in GBM and melanoma. However, the underlying biological mechanisms causing worse outcome are widely speculative so far. Thus this project follows the hypothesis that presence of a TERT promoter mutation and consequently TERT overexpression facilitates a more aggressive type of malignant progression irrespective of the affected tissue or cell type. Accordingly, we aim to elucidate on a comparative basis, the impact of TERT promoter mutations and its interaction with a nearby single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs2853669) on cancer cell aggressiveness in GBM and further confirm promising results in MPM. Moreover, we hypothesize that these genomic TERT promoter variants have an impact on secondary DNA structures and alter the sensitivity of malignant cells towards TERT promoter targeting by quadruplex stabilising agents. To validate these hypotheses we will use the following approaches: 1) Comparison of cell biological differences (growth, migration, stem cell properties and therapy response) between TERT promoter wild-type and mutated GBM cell lines and isogenic cell models (generated by CRISPR/Cas9 technology and thus only differing with regard to the TERT promoter mutation status). 2) Investigation of TERT promoter activity using luciferase reporter constructs containing wild-type or mutated sequence with our without the rs2853669 SNP. These experiments will be performed in cell models of GBM and MPM with variable endogenous TERT promoter sequences and compared to isogenic cell lines of each entity. 3) Dissection of transcription factor (TF) recruitment to different TERT promoter variants in GBM (DNA/protein pulldown followed by shot-gun proteomics mass-spectrometry in comparison to chromatin immunoprecipitation). 4) Knock-down of the most promising TF and impact on telomerase stability, promoter activity and on non-canonical TERT functions including NF-?B and WNT pathway activation. 5) Comparison of gene expression patterns in cell models of GBM harbouring a differing TERT promoter status and extraction of altered signatures using systems biology approaches (GEO, GORILLA, GSEA). 6) Analysing the impact of the TERT promoter status on sensitivity towards experimental telomerase inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. The project will be performed by the applicant (Daniela Lötsch) in close collaboration with clinical partners (Departments of Neurosurgery and Thoracic Surgery in Vienna and Linz) and collaboration partners abroad (Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology; DKFZ-Heidelberg and Medicinal and Bioinorganic Chemistry, Cardiff, UK).

208    Professor Evans Jeffry    University of Glasgow    2015-07-01    2020-06-30    Translational Cancer Therapeutics    BackgroundPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a poor prognosis and novel pre-clinical and clinical approaches are required to develop more effective strategies to treat pre-invasive, micro-metastatic, and advanced disease. We have developed a number of novel genetically-engineered murine models (and cell lines from these tumours) that have allowed us to understand the biological function of key tumour suppressor genes and oncogenes in vivo in both normal tissues and tumours, allowed us to identify and characterise the signalling pathways that are deregulated at the early stages of pancreatic cancer, during the development and progression of the invasive and metastatic phenotype, and that are potential therapeutic targets in advanced disease. AimsThe aim of our work is to determine how potential anti-cancer agents might best be evaluated in subsequent clinical trials in PDAC. Specifically, we will (a) investigate key pathways downstream of KRAS to develop therapies in advanced disease. We will focus on the mTOR pathway, to explore which downstream targets are important for tumour cell survival and proliferation, identify in which genetic backgrounds that target inhibition will have most efficacy, and to pre-clinically test inhibitors and combinatorial approaches(b) optimize therapy in localised disease by targeting myeloid cells to suppress metastasis and to improve immunotherapy. We will investigate the key immune cell types and signals in the PDAC microenvironment and how they impinge on immune suppression, and assess how best to modulate tumour immunity in vivo, with regards to rational combinations. Initially, we will focus on inhibition of CXCR2 or CSF1R to enhance T-cell tumour infiltration and increases anti-PD1 efficacy.MethodsWe will use clinically relevant inhibitors, shRNA or CRISPR / Cas9 technology to inhibit candidate targets in cell lines from appropriate mouse models. Analysis by qPCR or immunoblotting will be performed to validate the mechanism of action of successful candidates and to identify companion biomarkers for future clinical studies. We will use our mouse models for genetic validation and to assess the efficacy of candidate therapies or combinations, using PET imaging to assess therapeutic efficacy with regard to tumour metabolism and proliferation where relevant. We will identify potential genotype-specific biomarker signatures in murine models and confirm the clinical relevance of these in human tissue microarrays, which can then be used to guide patient selection in subsequent clinical studies.We will use the results of these studies to develop clinical trials in patients with PDAC.

209    Dr Zelenay Santiago    University of Manchester    2015-08-01    2022-07-31    Manchester Immunology Group    Identification and characterisation of mediators of tumour promoting or inhibitory inflammation: The notion of immune-based control of cancer has historically been controversial but has gained great support from the remarkable clinical success of certain types of immunotherapy over the past few years. This is certainly the case of melanoma, where some patients have shown complete and durable responses upon treatment with immune checkpoint blocking antibodies. Also promising results were obtained in treatment-refractory cancers such as metastatic non-small-cell lung carcinoma, a type of cancer that until recently was considered as unresponsive to immunotherapy. Nevertheless, in all cases, only a fraction of patients responds underscoring the need for mechanistic studies to determine why this is the case. Indeed, how tumours evade natural and therapy-induced immune responses is a long-standing question in cancer biology. The concept that cancer induces inflammation and that inflammatory cells at the tumour site promote several key aspects of malignant tumours such as proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis or migration, is well established. On the other hand, some types of inflammation such as the one characterised by T cell infiltration, particularly by cytotoxic T cells, are associated with a favourable prognosis and clinical benefit. Moreover, effective anti-tumour immunity depends on inflammatory mediators that contribute to the activation of immune cells such as dendritic cells. Together, these observations indicate that cancer-associated inflammation can have both tumour-promoting and inhibitory effects. How different types of inflammation are manipulated by a growing tumour and to what extent this constitutes an opportunity for therapeutic intervention remains incompletely explored. In this context, our group investigates the mechanisms by which cancer cells trigger the immune system and simultaneously evade anti-tumour immunity. The aim of this project will be to identify and characterise factors that modulate the function of immune cells such as dendritic cells in the tumour microenvironment, distinguishing mediators promoting anti-tumour immunity from those that support tumour growth. Building on from our recent work (Zelenay et al. Cell 2015), the successful candidate will evaluate how specific genetic mutations in cancer cells impact in their ability to modulate the recruitment and function of immune cells through a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches. These will include implementing CRISPR-Cas9 technology for genome editing of cancer cells bearing defined combinations of oncogenic mutations, the use of genetically-engineered transplantable and autochthonous mouse models of cancer and the analysis of samples from cancer patients.

210    Dr. DIMCHEV Georgi    INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AUSTRIA    2018-07-01    2020-06-30    Protein structure and function in filopodia across scales    Filopodia are dynamic protrusions extending from the cell periphery, acting as sensory organelles in migration, adhesion, neuronal guidance and wound healing. They are also linked to pathological conditions, such as cancer and viral infections. Filopodia consist of actin filaments that are spatially organized into bundles by actin bundling proteins. Various combinations of bundling proteins are expressed in different cell types, but their specific function and potential redundancy has remained enigmatic. Many actin-regulating proteins in filopodia and other cellular compartments have been studied on the cellular level, examining their influence on cell morphology and dynamics. Understanding filopodial proteins at an ultra-structural level in their native context is another promising approach to deciphering their role. However, for most proteins structural in situ information is unavailable, due to experimental challenges. Our proposal aims to reveal the detailed function and redundancy of actin filament bundlers in filopodia across scales, from the cellular level, down to the scale of individual proteins. We want to correlate protein structure with its role in cell morphology and filopodial morphodynamics, all within the same experimental system. We will generate CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic knockouts of Fascin1, Daam1 and Fimbrin in B16-F1 cells and characterise them on the cellular and ultrastructural level. Live imaging microscopy and sophisticated image analysis will reveal changes in morphodynamical parameters upon knocking out proteins. Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) is a powerful method to provide three-dimensional insights into complex cellular environments, and will be performed to acquire the ultrastructure of filopodia. This will reveal how the density and distribution of filopodial proteins and the actin network organization is affected upon loss of the targeted proteins. Novel image processing techniques (i.e. subtomogram averaging) will be then used to retrieve high-resolution structural information on filopodial proteins within their native environment. Acquiring high-resolution structural information on proteins in their native environment and linking this to morphodynamical parameters will be a significant breakthrough towards a holistic cellular structural biology approach. The project will significantly advance our knowledge on filopodia formation, maintenance and the functional redundancy of bundling proteins. The applicant Georgi Dimchev is an expert in studying actin-mediated cell migration using cell biology methods and imaging techniques. His expertise perfectly complements that within the research group of Florian Schur (co-applicant) at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria, where the applicant intends to address the above-mentioned questions. The Schur lab employs and develops correlative live-cell imaging, cryo-ET and subtomogram averaging methods to study the structure of the actin cytoskeleton in situ.

However, the full scope of benefits that these systems can provide, as well as their costs remain unknown. Specifically, it is unclear whether the benefits against viral infection outweigh the continual costs incurred even in the absence of parasitic elements, and whether CRISPR-Cas systems affect microbial genome diversity in nature. Since CRISPR-Cas systems can impede lateral gene transfer, it is often assumed that they reduce genetic diversity. Conversely, our recent results suggest the exact opposite: that these systems generate a high level of genomic diversity within populations. We have recently combined genomics of environmental strains and experimental genetics to show that archaea frequently acquire CRISPR immune memory, known as spacers, from chromosomes of related species in the environment. The presence of these spacers reduces gene exchange between lineages, indicating that CRISPR-Cas contributes to diversification. We have also shown that such inter-species mating events induce the acquisition of spacers against a strain's own replicons, supporting a role for CRISPR-Cas systems in generating deletions in natural plasmids and unessential genomic loci, again increasing genome diversity within populations. Here we aim to test our hypothesis that CRISPR-Cas systems increase within-population diversity, and quantify their benefits to both cells and populations, using large-scale genomics and experimental evolution. We will explore how these systems alter the patterns of recombination within and between species, and explore the potential involvement of CRISPR-associated proteins in cellular DNA repair.

215    Dr An Jing    Xi’an Jiaotong University    2019-03-01    2021-02-28    Towards CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene correction for inherited retinal disease    Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders caused by monogenic mutation of >250 genes, and together, they are a major cause of blindness. Recent advances in gene therapy research forecast a bright future for IRD treatment. Retina has distinct advantages for gene therapy because of its small confined space, easy accessibility by surgery, and immune privilege. The FDA in the US has recently approved the first ever gene therapy for treating an IRD (by overexpression of the normal gene). But this popular gene supplementation approach has its weaknesses, e.g. the co-existing influence of the mutant gene and therefore is not suitable for all IRDs. The newly emerged CRISPR/Cas9 technology enables highly specific in-situ gene editing, heralding a new era for developing gene therapy for IRDs. Cacna1f gene encodes a retina abundant Cav1.4 channel protein and mutations in this gene can cause the incomplete congenital stationary night blindness (iCSNB) in human. My current lab identified a spontaneous single mutation in rat Cacna1f gene responsible for iCSNB-like phenotypes in rats. We tested gene supplementation therapy in these rats by overexpressing the wild type Cacna1f gene in the retina, but detected no significant change in visual function. Therefore we will next turn to the CRISPR/Cas9 technology for Cacna1f gene correction. In this proposed project, taking advantage of the UK co-applicant’s extensive experience in mouse gene manipulation, we aim to examine the feasibility and efficacy of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Cacna1f gene correction in Cav1.4 IT mice, which feature a CACNA1F-I756T mutation and reflect very well the functional phenotype seen in human patients with a corresponding CACNA1F-I745T mutation. We will make AAV-based Cas9 and sgRNA constructs designed to cleave target DNA near the genomic site corresponding to CACNA1F-I756T and assess them in 3T3 cells to find the most efficient CRISPR/Cas9 system for DNA cleavage. We will further evaluate CRISPR/Cas9-mediated precise gene editing in 3T3 cells using a donor template of Cacna1f containing an edit. Then we will construct a donor template of wild type Cacna1f (of the same design as the one above) for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene correction in the retina of Cav1.4 IT mice. We will also use a donor template of Cacna1f containing an insertion of Tdtom cassette for easy examination of gene editing efficiency. If acquired data are promising, we will further assess the therapeutic effect of the above gene correction in Cav1.4 IT mice.

The cells of the blastocyst are capable of generating all adult cell types, a phenomenon known as pluripotency. The inner cell mass (ICM) of the blastocyst can moreover be cultured in a dish as pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs). ESCs have become invaluable tools in regenerative medicine and to study development itself. With 1 in 8 couples experiencing infertility in the UK, it is ever more important to understand the factors contributing to healthy embryo development. Transposable elements (TEs) are parts of our DNA that are currently or historically mobile, -i.e. having the capacity to 'paste' themselves into new places in the genome. Many TE sequences used to be thought of as simply 'junk DNA'; however, we are beginning to understand that TEs have evolved to play new and unexpected roles in development and disease. For example, uncontrolled TE activity has been implicated in neurodegeneration and cancer. However, the expression of many TEs is also high in normal development, suggesting that they may also have beneficial roles in cells. This proposal focuses on exploring the function and regulation of a particular TE, called mouse endogenous retrovirus type L, MERVL. MERVL is the earliest expressed TE, and is transiently upregulated in mouse embryos at the 2-cell stage. This stage, conserved in human in 4-8 cell embryos, encompasses an essential process called Zygotic Genome Activation, when the embryo begins to turn on its own genes for the first time. These embryos are also considered "totipotent", meaning that they can not only generate embryonic tissues but also extra-embryonic tissues (like placenta). Interestingly, a small proportion of ESCs transiently become "2C-like" in normal culture, also possessing enhanced developmental potency. Here, we will use mouse ESCs and mouse embryos to investigate how and why MERVL regulation is important in early development. Using these tools, we will identify and characterize key factors required to activate and repress MERVL. In turn, we will investigate how these factors regulate the 2-cell stage, and affect ZGA and totipotency. To understand how MERVL and other TEs are directly regulated, we will combine genome-editing systems, called CRISPR/Cas9, with recent biochemical tools to pull out sets of proteins that bind MERVL. Lastly, we will explore the conservation of MERVL function and regulation in human cells, where a similar TE, HERVL, is known to play a conserved role. We aim to a) understand how HERVL regulates the 4-8 cell stage and human ZGA b) investigate how new HERVL regulators might contribute to specific cases of disease. These studies will significantly increase our understanding of how TEs contribute to early development, and will shed insight on how such processes are perturbed in disease.

222    Dr. KÖNIG Eva Maria    St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute    2019-03-15    2022-03-14    Find tumor immune evasion strategies by cellular barcoding    Immunotherapy has evolved into a pillar of cancer treatment along with therapeutic concepts such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Although most cancer immunotherapies aim at re-activating T cells, targeting natural killer (NK) cells is attracting growing attention, as NK cells are at the forefront of anti-tumor responses. However, the euphoria from recent successes stemming from the infusion of pre-activated NK cells into tumor patients is tempered by the fact that some tumor cells adapt to the constant pressure imposed by the body’s immune system. This concept of ‘immunoediting’ has been convincingly shown in experimental models of chemically induced tumors but whether and how it applies in other malignancies is still a matter of debate. We hypothesize that immunoediting takes place in natural tumors. There is unequivocal evidence for the importance of NK cells in the fight against leukemia and novel therapies using the adoptive transfer of cytokine-induced NK cells are highly successful. We thus choose leukemia as a model system to address whether NK cell-mediated immunoediting takes place. Our study design will allow two potential scenarios to be distinguished: (i) NK cells are able to kill highly immunogenic cell clones but spare pre-existing resistant sub-clones (clonal selection) or (ii) NK cells shape tumor immunogenicity by classical immunoediting. Our approach will also allow us to determine the molecular mechanisms of tumor evasion from NK cell-mediated eradication. This will be achieved by means of a cellular barcoding system that allows single leukemic cells to be tracked in vivo. The combination of cellular barcoding and next generation sequencing will enable us to determine the transcriptional changes in NK cell-resistant leukemic cell clones. Finally, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene modification will be used to identify driver mutations responsible for tumor evasion and to validate our findings. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor immune evasion is the first step towards utilizing the full potential of NK cells in anti-tumor therapy. Ultimately, the study will pave the way for new therapeutic approaches to treat tumors that have successfully evaded the immune system. The study will be supervised by the applicant Eva Maria König and the laboratory work will be performed by a PhD student at the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, supported by the applicant.

I will perform functional characterization of RA risk loci with the aim of translating GWAS findings into biological disease mechanisms and suggesting therapeutic targets. My key goals are: 1. To identify the genes that cause RA. I will identify chromatin interactions between RA loci and their targets using capture Hi-C in primary CD4+ T-cells and synovial fibroblasts from RA patients. I will explore whether associated SNP genotypes are correlated with differential expression of the genes they interact with. 2. To elucidate the mechanism by which RA-associated SNPs alter their target genes. Regulatory elements containing disease-associated SNPs will be identified in primary cells from patients and their functional importance will be verified using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. 3. To translate research findings into patient benefit. Identified causal genes and pathways will be intersected with known drug targets to identify existing drugs whose safety and efficacy has been proven in other diseases and which could potentially be re-purposed to treat RA.

225    Dr. DORARD-CAHENZLI Coralie    University of Vienna    2018-08-01    2021-07-31    Role of RAF1 in colorectal carcinogenesis in 3D models    Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer world-wide and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in developed countries. In spite of permanent improvements in surgery and chemotherapeutic treatments, cancer relapse remains frequent, and around 50% of patients die within five years following the initial diagnosis. This emphasizes the need for a better understanding of cancer biology as a prerequisite towards finding new and more effective therapies. Two major groups of CRC had been described: those displaying MicroSatellite Instability (MSI) (10-15%) and those that are microsatellite stable but chromosomally unstable (CIN) (85-90%). The MAPK pathway, a conserved signaling cascade implicated in many cellular processes connected with tumorigenesis, is frequently deregulated in CRC, often due to the presence of activating KRAS mutations (40% of CRC). Unfortunately, KRAS-driven CRC is resistant to most treatments, and a full understanding of the biological mechanisms downstream of mutated KRAS is essential for the development of new targeted therapies. Studies in RAS-driven tumors in animal models have shown essential roles of the RAS effectors RAF, which can be dependent or independent of their ability to activate the MEK/ERK module. In particular, the RAF paralog RAF1 exerts unique essential functions in the control of apoptosis, cell migration, cell-cell adhesion and differentiation. Sporadic evidence in the literature suggest potential roles of RAF1 in CRC which are dependent of its kinase activity but MEK-independent. With this background in mind, we plan to systematically investigate the role of RAF1 in KRAS-driven CRC. To this aim, we will use 3D models (spheroids and human organoids), which better reflect in vivo tumors, to define the role of RAF1 in KRAS-induced CRC with MSI or MSS (microsatellite stable) backgrounds. We will start by characterizing the biological processes impacted by RAF1 ablation (generated by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing) or inducible silencing (by Tet-inducible shRNA). To decipher the underlying mechanisms, a candidate and unbiased approaches will be deployed, and the identified targets will be validated in rescue experiments 3D models. The results obtained will identify new RAF1-related vulnerabilities in CRC which could pave the road for the design of new targeted therapies. This project will be done in the lab of Univ.-Prof. Dr. Manuela Baccarini, who has a strong expertise in cell signaling and knock-out/knock-down approaches. The project will be performed in collaboration with Dr Helmut Dolznig (Medical University of Vienna, Austria) who is experienced in 3D CRC models and with Dr Alex Duval (CdR Saint-Antoine, Paris, France), who is an expert in colorectal cancer genetics and especially MSI tumors. Dr Mathew Garnett (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK), will provide us human CRC organoids and its expertise in this field.    Austrian Science Fund FWF    None    234210.0EUR
226    Dr. Siegel Tim Nicolai    University of Munich (LMU)    2017-04-01    2022-03-31    The role of three-dimensional genome architecture in antigenic variation    Antigenic variation is a widely employed strategy to evade the host immune response. It has similar functional requirements even in evolutionarily divergent pathogens. These include the mutually exclusive expression of antigens and the periodic, nonrandom switching in the expression of different antigens during the course of an infection. Despite decades of research the mechanisms of antigenic variation are not fully understood in any organism. The recent development of high-throughput sequencing-based assays to probe the 3D genome architecture (Hi-C) has revealed the importance of the spatial organization of DNA inside the nucleus. 3D genome architecture plays a critical role in the regulation of mutually exclusive gene expression and the frequency of translocation between different genomic loci in many eukaryotes. Thus, genome architecture may also be a key regulator of antigenic variation, yet the causal links between genome architecture and the expression of antigens have not been studied systematically. In addition, the development of CRISPR-Cas9-based approaches to perform nucleotide-specific genome editing has opened unprecedented opportunities to study the influence of DNA sequence elements on the spatial organization of DNA and how this impacts antigen expression. I have adapted both Hi-C and CRISPR-Cas9 technology to the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, one of the most important model organisms to study antigenic variation. These techniques will enable me to bridge the field of antigenic variation research with that of genome architecture. I will perform the first systematic analysis of the role of genome architecture in the mutually exclusive and hierarchical expression of antigens in any pathogen. The experiments outlined in this proposal will provide new insight, facilitating a new view of antigenic variation and may eventually help medical intervention in T. brucei and in other pathogens relying on antigenic variation for their survival.

228    Prof VELDINK Jan Herman    UNIVERSITAIR MEDISCH CENTRUM UTRECHT    2018-07-01    2023-06-30    Emerging Simplex ORigins In ALS    My aim is to understand the exact genetic contribution in every patient with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), a lethal disease with a life time risk of 0.3% and an urgent unmet therapeutic need. I have recently shown a disproportionate large contribution from low-frequency genetic variants in ALS. ALS is not simply a collection of unique rare diseases with a monogenetic cause nor is it a diagnostic continuum with a complex contribution of thousands of small effect factors. ALS is in-between, which I call “simplex”, where in each patient a few, considerably strong genetic factors with or without environmental factors are at play. ALS mutations are characterized by reduced penetrance, variable clinical expressivity, have specific pleiotropic clinical features and interact with environmental factors. These phenomena are unexplained, but provide me with important and new opportunities in order to unravel the clinical, genetic and biological heterogeneity in ALS. I have created new research fields to go an important step beyond the state of the art: Splitting by lumping uses novel machine learning algorithms to reclassify patients using clinical pleiotropic features, environmental factors and blood epigenetic profiles to identify novel ALS mutations. Imaging genomics overlays patterns in ALS-associated brain morphology on MRI with brain gene-expression patterns to find ALS mutations. ALS risk in 3D integrates data on three-dimensional folding of DNA with genetic data to identify causal mutations and mutation-to-mutation interaction. ALS genomic modifiers in 3D identifies modifiers of C9orf72 mutations through the development of cellular reporter assays and CRISPR-Cas9 based screens. Genomic findings are translated using cellular models which can be used for targeted and unbiased drug screens. If successful, my approaches can be applied beyond the scope of this ERC and will have a clear impact on clinical trial design and genetic counselling in ALS in particular.

229    Prof PAOLICELLI Rosa Chiara Immacolata    UNIVERSITE DE LAUSANNE    2019-01-01    2023-12-31    Targeting pathological synaptic pruning by microglia in neurodegeneration    Synapse loss is the major correlate of cognitive impairment in many neurodegenerative diseases. Recent literature suggests that microglia, which mediate synaptic pruning during brain development, can be responsible for synapse loss in neurodegeneration. Although the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, growing evidence indicates that dysfunctional microglia affect synapses number and function in pathology. Genome-wide association studies reveal that the majority of risk genes associated with neurodegenerative disorders are highly expressed in microglia. While such studies clearly implicate these cells in the pathogenesis of the disease, little is known about the causal mechanisms that link microglial risk variants to loss of synapses. We will identify the molecular mechanisms involved in microglia-mediated synapse loss. We will also generate novel in vitro and ex vivo models of ‘risk microglia’, by introducing genetic variants associated with cognitive impairment –alone or in combination- specifically in microglia, taking advantage of CRISPR/ Cas9 genome editing techniques. These goals will be achieved by combining cutting-edge transcriptomics and proteomics with mouse models of intense synaptic remodelling, to reveal the unique molecular signature of ‘shaper microglia’. A multidisciplinary approach will allow the extensive characterisation of risk models, by combining metabolic analysis, synaptic phagocytosis and degradation assays, with super-resolution microscopy, and novel genetically encoded labelling methods. With the knowledge generated here, we aim at developing and validating in vivo novel drugs- and nanobodies-based approaches for effective targeting of pathological pruning. In summary, REMIND will focus on: 1) Identifying molecular players in microglial-mediated synapse loss 2) Generating ‘risk microglia’ models, to asses the role of genetic variants associated with neurodegeneration 3) Developing novel strategies for targeting prunining    European Research Council    Starting Grant    1499991.0EUR
230    Mr Johansen Kristoffer    University of Cambridge    2016-10-01    2020-09-30    Signaling by novel PI3K effector proteins in T cells    The proposed research project seeks to describe and characterise the roles of novel PIP3-binding proteins in T cells by knocking out PIP3-binding proteins identified during a RNAseq screen with CRISPR/Cas9 in T cell lines, primary T cells, and eventually in vivo in mouse models. By using functional assays, such as ICAM-binding assays, intracellular IFN&gamma; staining, and APC-T cell conjugation assays, the identified proteins will be characterized. Key goals of the project will be: 1) To establish techniques for knocking out the identified PIP3-binding proteins in primary Tcells. 2) To functionally analyse the knockout T cells from goal 1 and identify novel PIP-binding proteins with roles in T cell migration, adhesion, or activation. 3) To investigate a select few novel PIP3-binding proteins in vivo either by bone marrow reconstitution with KO cells, T cell transfer models, or complete conditional knockout as established with CRISPR/Cas9 at the Babraham Institute.I expect that we will help elucidate on the signalling pathways involved in T cell function, and thereby potentially gain knowledge on proteins downstream in the PI3K signalling pathway that potentially could be pharmaceutical targets in cancers, autoimmune, and infectious diseases.

232    Mr Byrne Dwayne    University of Lausanne    2016-12-01    2018-11-30    The Genomic Basis of Life History Adaptation    Life history traits are central to our understanding of adaptation because they represent direct targets of selection. However, while much progress has been made in uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying fitness-related traits, mainly by studying large-effect mutants in model organisms, little is known about naturally occurring genetic variants that affect these traits. The central aim of my current SNSF Professorship grant is to identify naturally occurring polymorphisms that underlie evolutionary changes in life history, using Drosophila melanogaster as a model. Over the last 33 months, we have used two complementary approaches to tackle this problem: to generate 'catalogs' of candidate variants we have applied whole-genome Pool-sequencing to (1) North American populations clinally differentiated for life history and (2) a >30-year-long artificial selection experiment for longevity. Both approaches are 'designed' to maximize among-population life-history differentiation and thus to increase our ability to map life-history variants via sequencing. In a second step, we have begun to perform experiments to examine the life-history effects of some of these candidate mechanisms. Based on our genomic analyses, we have prioritized three candidate mechanisms for experiments: (1) for the cline, we have identified clinal SNP polymorphisms in several genes involved in insulin signaling, a pathway known from molecular studies to regulate life-history physiology, including a clinal 2-SNP polymorphism in the transcription factor gene foxo; (2) a clinal chromosomal inversion polymorphism, In(3R)Payne, to which 79% of the most strongly clinal SNPs in the genome map; and (3), in the selection experiment, we have found strong enrichment of immunity genes among our top candidates. To date, our experiments show that (1) the foxo polymorphism has major pleiotropic on egg-to-adult survival, body size and starvation resistance, in assays based on synthetic recombinant inbred lines; (2) the In(3R)Payne polymorphism is maintained by clinal selection, independent of neutrality and admixture, and affects body size, a strongly clinal trait; and (3) the long-lived selection lines survive pathogenic infections much better than the controls. In this application for a 2-year extension of my grant, we propose to follow up on these promising leads. First, to better understand how the foxo polymorphism affects life history, we will use homologous replacement of the 2 SNPs (and their allelic combinations) into a common background via CRISPR/Cas9, in collaboration with Alistair McGregor (Oxford); we will measure additive and epistatic effects of these constructs on life history and FOXO activity. Second, to identify targets of selection within In(3R)Payne, we will phase-sequence isochromosomal lines and apply ABC-based coalescent models to the data, in collaboration with Mark Kirkpatrick (Austin). In addition, we will perform RNA-seq of standard vs. inverted lines to uncover transcriptional differences between inversion karyotypes. Finally, to begin to uncover the regulatory details of the intriguing but poorly understood connection between lifespan and immunity in the longevity selection lines, we will assay transcriptional responses to infection in selection versus control lines, both in young and old flies, and - secondly - test whether silencing immune genes via transgenic RNAi affects lifespan, as hypothesized. Together, this integrative approach - spanning population genomics, functional genetics, and physiology - will significantly advance our understanding of the molecular basis of adaptive changes in life history and aging, a fundamental but largely unresolved problem in evolutionary biology.

234    Prof. BOERJAN Wout    VIB VZW    2019-07-01    2024-06-30    Large-scale identification of secondary metabolites, metabolic pathways and their genes in the model tree poplar    Poplar is an important woody biomass crop and at the same time the model of choice for molecular research in trees. Although there is steady progress in resolving the functions of unknown genes, the identities of most secondary metabolites in poplar remain unknown. The lack of metabolite identities in experimental systems is a true gap in information content, and impedes obtaining deep insight into the complex biology of living systems. The main reason is that metabolites are difficult to purify because of their low abundance, hindering their structural characterization and the discovery of their biosynthetic pathways. In this project, we will use CSPP, an innovative method recently developed in my lab, to systematically predict the structures of metabolites along with their biosynthetic pathways in poplar wood, bark and leaves. This CSPP method is based on a combination of metabolomics and informatics. In a next step, the CSPP tool will be combined with two complementary genetic approaches based on re-sequence data from 750 poplar trees to identify the genes encoding the enzymes in the predicted pathways. Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) will be made to identify SNPs in the genes involved in the metabolic conversions. Subsequently, rare defective alleles will be identified for these genes in the sequenced population. Genes identified by both approaches will then be further studied either by crossing natural poplars that are heterozygous for the defective alleles, or by CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing in poplar. The functional studies will be further underpinned by enzyme assays. Given our scarce knowledge on the structure of most secondary metabolites and their metabolic pathways in poplar, this large-scale identification effort will lay the foundation for systems biology research in this species, and will shape opportunities to further develop poplar as an industrial wood-producing crop.

235    Dr. VESELY Cornelia    Medical University of Vienna    2019-08-05    2022-08-04    Adjusting the base: (Epi)transcriptomic RNA modification in inflammation & host-microbiome crosstalk    The recognition of widespread and diverse RNA modifications and their influence on genetic information has sparked epitranscriptomic research with impact on biology and medicine. The most abundant modification known is RNA-editing by adenine to inosine deamination, found in all classes of RNAs but rRNAs. Editing is essential, as deletions of the responsible deaminases ADAR1 or ADAR2 are lethal in mice. Mutations in ADAR1 cause aberrant sensing of self-RNAs leading to the autoinflammatory Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. Inosines are interpreted as guanosines. Thus, editing can recode mRNAs or retarget microRNAs. For instance, the mRNAs encoding Filamin-a (FLNA) and Filamin-b (FLNB) undergo a glutamine to arginine recoding in their C-termini. FLNA editing levels vary across tissues, reaching almost 90% in the gut. Besides a link to smooth muscle cell contraction consequences of FLNA editing are largely unknown. Our preliminary data show that RNA-editing ameliorates inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colon cancer. In the gut host and microbiota constantly communicate, partially by secreted microRNAs but also by RNA modifications. Thus, RNA-modifications will regulate and affect the host-fecal microbiota crosstalk also impacting IBD. We could already demonstrate an altered microbiome in FLNA editing deficient mice. Organism-wide RNA-editing can suppress inflammation by inhibiting the RNA sensor MDA5. Potentially, also other MDA5 related helicases are involved in modification-dependent protection from hyperinflammation. Here, we aim to study the role of FLNA mRNA editing in IBD and cancer and the impact of microRNA editing and modifications on the host-microbiota crosstalk. Lastly, the role of helicases in discriminating self vs. non-self RNA will be investigated. Results will advance the field of epitranscriptomic research and potentially serve as a basis to diagnose or treat IBD and colon cancer. The questions will be addressed using a wide spectrum of methods. State-of-the-art mouse models of IBD and cancer will be combined with microbiota analysis in rescued ADAR knockout mice and mice expressing constitutively edited/unedited FLNA. Transcriptomics will identify key edited or overexpressed microRNAs, which will be further explored by generating mice with inducible, tissue-specific editing by CRISPR/Cas9, a completely novel approach. Finally, the involvement of RNA helicases in the ADAR1-MDA5 axis will be explored by an innovative CRISPR screen. The involved researchers have highly complementary expertise. CV will focus on transcriptomics and RNA-editing molecular biology, FP is a microbiologist specialized in microbiota research, FE is an experienced immunologist and KC, a co-inventor of CRISPR/Cas9, will focus on genome engineering of cutting edge mouse models.

GLUT4 traffics through multiple compartments to reach specialised storage vesicles (GSV) from where it can be recruited to the plasma membrane upon insulin stimulation. Trafficking events involving sorting GLUT4 and other cargo proteins from a late endosomal compartment back into the recycling pool are essential for the formation of the GSV. Retromer and the newly discovered retriever complexes play a role in late-endosomal sorting. In this study, we propose to explore the potential role of the retriever complex in GSV formation. We have generated clonal knockout 3T3-L1 cell lines, using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, lacking Vps29 (common to both retromer and retriever complexes), Vps35 (unique to retromer) and Vps35L/C16orf62 (unique to retriever). We have confirmed the knockout status of the clones, performed some preliminary analysis and will further characterise them to determine phenotype in the absence of these proteins. Using a range of cell-biology and biochemistry techniques, we will determine for the first time whether the retriever complex affects GLUT4 sorting to GSVs and its translocation to the plasma membrane in response to insulin stimulation and facilitate glucose uptake.

240    Univ.-Prof ZOTCHEV Sergey    University of Vienna    2019-11-01    2023-10-31    Novel bacterial metabolites via synthetic biology    Wider research context: Bacterial secondary metabolites represent a treasure trove for drug discovery (e.g. antibiotics, anti-cancer and immunomodulating agents etc), and provide new insight into the natural product biosynthesis. However, many bacteria harbor secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters (BGCs) that are not expressed under laboratory conditions, and thus their products cannot be purified and characterized. Synthetic biology is a new scientific discipline that applies engineering principles to biological systems with the aim of improving them or building novel ones. Synthetic biology approaches can be used to re-engineer (refactor) silent biosynthetic genes in such a way, that they can be expressed in heterologous hosts, leading to production of previously undiscovered secondary metabolites. Research question and objectives: SynBioBac project intends to address the challenge of “waking” silent biosynthetic genes in bacteria by using synthetic biology principles and tools. Correspondingly, the objectives include cloning of selected BGCs, their disassembly and refactoring with new regulatory elements, development of tools for activation of gene expression and sensing of produced secondary metabolites, expression of refactored BGCs in several heterologous bacterial hosts, followed by purification and characterization of novel secondary metabolites. Methods: Construction of representative gene libraries followed by screening; assembly of complete BGCs in yeast (transformation-associated recombination); BGCs disassembly using a combination of PCR and restriction digests; refactoring in yeast with new regulatory elements with help of CRISPR/Cas system; construction of activator and biosensor devices; expression in pre-engineered bacterial hosts; identification of metabolites with high-resolution mass spectrometry; purification and structure elucidation with NMR; testing for biological activities. Level of originality: The project goes well beyond current state-of-the-art, since it develops and tests an original synthetic biology-based approach to “waking” silent bacterial genes for biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. It is intended to provide a roadmap for drug discovery that can be applied to virtually any bacterial species, and may in itself discover novel bioactive natural products with applied potential.

241    Univ.-Prof ZOTCHEV Sergey    University of Manchester    2020-01-01    2022-12-31    Development of an in vitro model to dissect the mechanism of fungal persistence in the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung    Cystic fibrosis is the most common fatal genetically inherited disease in Caucasian populations. This disease is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator gene (CFTR) which produces defective ion fluxes and calcium homeostasis in the epithelia. Patients with cystic fibrosis are therefore susceptible to recurrent and lethal lung infections including those caused by the fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. Animal models play a central role in the study of cystic fibrosis. Researchers have used mice, ferrets, pigs and sheep to model the inflammatory response seen in human patients with this disease. Although such models generate useful knowledge on the pathophysiology of this disease, animal models are limited for a number of reasons. One is the ethical concerns about the numbers of mice that needed to generate gene or tissue specific knock-outs which likely die early after birth. Additionally, mice, the most common vertebrate animal used, do not completely recapitulate the disease phenotypes seen in the human lung during infection and larger vertebrate such as sheep, pigs and ferrets are often used instead. The use of larger animals intrinsically have a number of limitations including housing space, high cost of the experimentations and the need to use very high number of animals to get enough statistical significance. In vitro cell culture systems using immortalised cystic fibrosis epithelial cells from donors have been developed to overcome those problems. However, genetic variability between healthy immortalised and cystic fibrosis cell lines prevents precise and statically useful comparison of events in CF and control cells which has limited them to be widely adopted by the community. Here we propose to establish a new in vitro model of isogenic cystic fibrosis and healthy controls bronchial epithelial cell lines carrying different CF mutations in the CFTR gene using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis of 16HBE bronchial cells. Using an established methodological approach developed in our laboratory including in vitro infection, confocal microscopy, expression analysis, cytokine measurements and competitive fitness analysis the student will be able to define critical stages of the interaction between the cystic fibrosis epithelia and A. fumigatus compared to healthy cells and the fungal factors governing this process. The successful completion of this project will achieve a number of scientific objectives. Firstly, the development of an isogenic cell culture system of epithelial cell lines will be of great value for researchers focused on the study of epithelia-pathogen interactions in cystic fibrosis without using any mice. Secondly, screening of A. fumigatus null libraries on CF epithelia will increase our knowledge on the pathogen factors leading persistence in the context of disease. Additionally, the student will be enrolled in a 3Rs focused programme that will give him/her the opportunity to enrol with industrial partners in Manchester and our fungal community to promote the implementation on this resource in other laboratories at an international level. As a PhD studentship we will also provide extensive training opportunities for a student, and the wider research community, on the importance of alternatives to replace animal testing.

Here we propose to establish a new in vitro model of isogenic cystic fibrosis and healthy controls bronchial epithelial cell lines carrying different CF mutations in the CFTR gene using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis of 16HBE bronchial cells. Using an established methodological approach developed in our laboratory including in vitro infection, confocal microscopy, expression analysis, cytokine measurements and competitive fitness analysis the student will be able to define critical stages of the interaction between the cystic fibrosis epithelia and A. fumigatus compared to healthy cells and the fungal factors governing this process. The successful completion of this project will achieve a number of scientific objectives. Firstly, the development of an isogenic cell culture system of epithelial cell lines will be of great value for researchers focused on the study of epithelia-pathogen interactions in cystic fibrosis without using any mice. Secondly, screening of A. fumigatus null libraries on CF epithelia will increase our knowledge on the pathogen factors leading persistence in the context of disease. Additionally, the student will be enrolled in a 3Rs focused programme that will give him/her the opportunity to enrol with industrial partners in Manchester and our fungal community to promote the implementation on this resource in other laboratories at an international level. As a PhD studentship we will also provide extensive training opportunities for a student, and the wider research community, on the importance of alternatives to replace animal testing.

243    Professor Liston Adrian    Babraham Institute    2020-04-01    2023-03-31    Systemic analysis of the molecular mechanisms of leukocyte entry into the pancreas    Cystic fibrosis is the most common fatal genetically inherited disease in Caucasian populations. This disease is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator gene (CFTR) which produces defective ion fluxes and calcium homeostasis in the epithelia. Patients with cystic fibrosis are therefore susceptible to recurrent and lethal lung infections including those caused by the fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. Animal models play a central role in the study of cystic fibrosis. Researchers have used mice, ferrets, pigs and sheep to model the inflammatory response seen in human patients with this disease. Although such models generate useful knowledge on the pathophysiology of this disease, animal models are limited for a number of reasons. One is the ethical concerns about the numbers of mice that needed to generate gene or tissue specific knock-outs which likely die early after birth. Additionally, mice, the most common vertebrate animal used, do not completely recapitulate the disease phenotypes seen in the human lung during infection and larger vertebrate such as sheep, pigs and ferrets are often used instead. The use of larger animals intrinsically have a number of limitations including housing space, high cost of the experimentations and the need to use very high number of animals to get enough statistical significance. In vitro cell culture systems using immortalised cystic fibrosis epithelial cells from donors have been developed to overcome those problems. However, genetic variability between healthy immortalised and cystic fibrosis cell lines prevents precise and statically useful comparison of events in CF and control cells which has limited them to be widely adopted by the community.

247    Dr Castellano Leandro    Queen Mary, University of London    2020-10-01    2023-09-30    3D bio-printing human pluripotent stem cell-derived skeletal muscle constructs for disease modelling and drug discovery    The largest tissue of human body is skeletal muscle, which is responsible for voluntary movements and breathing. Muscular dystrophies are a group of debilitating inherited diseases, characterised by progressive skeletal muscle wasting, followed by accumulation of fat and connective tissue. Current standards of care do not provide effective treatment, and can only delay loss of ambulation, cardiac and respiratory problems. Some muscular dystrophies cause premature death. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common and currently incurable neuromuscular disorder. Numerous animal models have been developed for DMD, including the most commonly used mdx/dmd mice and larger animals, such as dogs and pigs. However, the mdx/dmd mice do not fully recapitulate human pathophysiology. Unfortunately, many drugs that could ameliorate phenotypes in mdx/dmd mice fail to show efficacy in clinical trials. To replace/reduce the use of mouse models in muscular dystrophy research, we propose to develop human-specific, physiology-relevant in vitro models that can be exploited for elucidating disease mechanisms and testing drug candidates for developing novel therapies. However, human primary myoblasts lose myogenicity after extensive expansion in culture and lack isogenic control cells for comparison. To overcome these challenges, we generated two iPSC lines from two patients with distinct DMD mutations. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, we precisely corrected the DMD mutations to obtain two CRISPR-corrected iPSC lines as isogenic controls. Following a transgene-free myogenic differentiation protocol, the isogenic pairs of iPSC lines were differentiated to myogenic progenitors, resembling human primary muscle precursor cells. Terminal differentiation of human iPSCs-derived myogenic progenitors formed multinucleated, striated myofibers. Full-length dystrophin expression was completely restored in the CRISPR-corrected muscle cells. As standard 3D culture does not reflect the complexity of highly aligned myofiber architecture in vivo, we propose to employ novel bioengineering technologies to bridge this gap. We will use 3D bio-printing to fabricate human iPSC-derived skeletal muscle constructs, followed by characterisation of the biophysical and biological properties of the 3D bio-printed human skeletal muscle constructs. We will establish a range of disease-relevant functional assays by assessing isogenic pairs of bio-printed human 3D models, such as contractile force generation, response to chemical and electric stimulus, oxidative stress, as well as calcium handling. Finally, as proof of concept, we will test candidate drugs in our physiology-relevant 3D in vitro models to investigating their efficacy in ameliorating pathophysiological phenotypes. In brief, human iPSC-derived myogenic progenitors in combination with 3D bio-printing technologies can provide human-specific platforms critically needed for elucidating disease mechanisms and facilitating drug discovery. Importantly, our experimental paradigms are broadly applicable to any muscle disease. This multidisciplinary project will have a significant impact on developing novel human pre-clinical models and replacing/reducing the use of mouse models in muscular dystrophy research.

249    Dr. ENGLINGER Bernhard    Medical University of Vienna    2019-04-01    2021-03-31    Single-cell RNA-sequencing of pediatric ependymoma    Scientific background and hypothesis of the project: Pediatric ependymoma constitutes a heterogeneous set of tumors affecting the neuroepithelial linings of the entire central nervous system. Especially high-grade subtypes are frequently refractory to chemotherapy and lead to poor overall outcomes for patients. Genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic profiling has revealed distinct molecular subgroups associated with high tumor aggressiveness, most frequently arising in children and adolescents. However, besides few exceptions, targetable oncogenic driver mutations and pathways still remain unidentified and molecular insights into ependymoma biology have yet resulted in only little progress in the clinical management of this disease. Thus, novel targets for systemic treatment of ependymoma urgently need to be identified. However, this endeavor is complicated by the rarity of this disease, its genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity, as well as the low abundance of recurrent genetic mutations, even in those subtypes exhibiting poor prognosis. One major shortcoming of the field is that the majority of current large-scale profiling is performed on bulk tumor tissue, obscuring its heterogenic make-up at single-cell level with regard to mutations/programs orchestrating key oncogenic proliferation, self-renewal, invasion, and chemo-resistance traits. Scientific innovation and originality of the proposed project: This project aims to interrogate the cellular architecture and the interplay between genetic mutations and transcriptional programs of ependymoma at unprecedented resolution, using single-cell transcriptomics. The leading expertise in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) in the applicant’s receiving institution will be leveraged to analyze single cells from fresh surgical specimen of the major molecular ependymoma subgroups. Matched patient-derived cell models will be used to functionally test putative targetable driver alterations identified by scRNA-seq, employing pharmacological or genome-editing technologies. Successful completion of this project will provide insight into ependymoma pathogenesis and to reveal novel oncogenic driver alterations of this disease at a resolution not achievable by conventional bulk tissue characterization. These insights are expected to catalyze the discovery of novel molecular targets for systemic ependymoma treatment to improve clinical management of this pediatric malignancy. Methods: Patient tumor specimen will be prepared and sorted as single-cell suspensions for full-length, whole-transcriptome scRNA-seq. Computational analysis tools will be used for bioinformatic work-up of intratumoral heterogeneity and to compare single-cell- with bulk tumor transcriptome/genomic- data. In vitro cultures of matched patient-derived cell models will be tested by pharmacological and CRISPR-Cas9-directed gene editing intervention. Primary responsible researchers of the project: Bernhard Englinger, PhD, the project applicant, will be the principal person conducting the proposed project. Mariella Filbin, MD, PhD, will be the project supervisor at the receiving institution (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston). Johannes Gojo, MD, PhD, at Medical University of Vienna will be the main collaborator coordinating the sharing of Vienna-originating patient material.

While some of the molecular determinants for cell fate specification have been identified, a fundamental understanding of which genetic activities are required in each cell of a developing tissue is still outstanding. The DECODE project will develop and apply leading-edge system genetics methods to Arabidopsis and Drosophila, two major model systems from the plant and animal kingdoms to decode context-dependent genetic networks in vivo. To achieve this, DECODE will bring together experimental and theoretical groups with complementary expertise in model organism genetics and cellular phenotyping, single-cell genomics, statistics and computational biology. Building on our combined expertise, we will create functional genetic maps using conditional CRISPR/Cas9-based single- and higher order knockout perturbations in vivo combined with single-cell expression profiling and imaging. Coupled with powerful computational analysis, this project will not only define, predict and rigorously test the unique genetic repertoire of each cell, but also unravel how genetic networks adapt their topology and function across cell types and external stimuli. With more than thousand conditional knockouts, characterized by several million single-cell transcriptome profiles and high-resolution imaging this project will create the largest single-cell perturbation map in any model organism and will provide fundamental insights into the genetic architecture of complex tissues. Analyzing two tissues with divergent organization and regulatory repertoire will enable us to uncover general principles in the genetic circuits controlling context dependent cell behavior. Consequently, we expect that the DECODE project in model organisms will lay the conceptual and methodological foundation for perturbation-based functional atlases in other tissues or species.

This ERC project proposes a novel crossing scheme that allows for an expeditious evaluation of combinations of potential yield contributing alleles by unifying ‘classical’ breeding with gene-centric molecular biology. The acronym BREEDIT, a word fusion of breeding and editing, reflects the basic concept of combining breeding with multiplex genome editing of yield related genes. By introducing plants with distinct combinations of genome edited mutations in more than 80 known yield related genes into a crossing scheme, the combinatorial effect of these mutations on plant growth and yield will be evaluated. Subsequent rounds of crossings will increase the number of stacked gene-edits per plant, thus increasing the combinatorial complexity. Phenotypic evaluations throughout plant development will be done on our in-house automated image-analysis based phenotyping platform. The nature and frequency of Cas9-mediated mutations in the entire plant collection will be characterised by multiplex amplicon sequencing to follow the efficiency of CRISPR-cas9 genome editing and to identify the underlying combinations of genes that cause beneficial phenotypes (genetic gain). The obtained knowledge on yield regulatory networks can be directly implemented into current molecular breeding programs and the project will provide the basis to develop targeted breeding schemes implementing the optimal combinations of beneficial alleles into elite material. BREEDIT will be a major step forward in integrating basic knowledge on genes with plant breeding and has the potential to provoke a paradigm shift in improving crop yield.

254    Dr. AMIT Ido    Weizmann Institute    2017-10-01    2022-09-30    Single cell genomic analysis and perturbations of hematopoietic progenitors: Towards a refined model of hematopoiesis    Hematopoiesis is an important model for stem cell differentiation with great medical significance. Heterogeneity within hematopoietic progenitor populations has considerably limited characterization and molecular understanding of lineage commitment in both health and disease. Advances in single-cell genomic technologies provide an extraordinary opportunity for unbiased and high resolution mapping of biological function and regulation. Recently we have developed an experimental and analytical method, termed massively parallel single-cell RNA-Seq (MARS-Seq), for unbiased classification of individual cells from their native context and successfully applied it for characterization of immune and hematopoietic progenitors. Here, we propose to uncover the hierarchy and regulatory mechanisms controlling hematopoiesis by combining comprehensive single-cell RNA-Seq analyses, modelling approaches, advanced functional assays, single-cell CRISPR screens, knockout models and epigenetic profiling. Exciting preliminary result show that indeed our approach is starting to uncover the complexity of hematopoietic progenitors and the regulatory circuits driving hematopoietic decisions. We will pursue the following aims: (i) Generate a refined model of hematopoiesis by comprehensive single-cell RNA-Seq profiling of hematopoietic progenitors, (ii) validate the predicted model by in vivo functional developmental assays and then (iii) test candidate transcription and chromatin factors uncovered by our model for their role in controlling progression towards various lineages using single-cell measurements combined with CRISPR screens. Together, our study is expected to generate a revised and high-resolution hematopoietic model and decipher the regulatory networks that control hematopoiesis. Our methods and models may provide a platform for future medical advancements including a large-scale European collaborative project to discover a comprehensive human hematopoietic tree.

255    Dr. AMIT Ido    Northwestern University    2020-05-01    2021-04-30    RAPID: Point-of-Need Detection of COVID-19 using CRISPR-Enabled Cell-Free Synthetic Biology    Biological Sciences - The COVID-19 pandemic highlights a limitation of laboratory-based testing for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in that it does not scale with a sudden and dramatic increase in volume. Laboratory tests, often based on quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), require equipment, time, expertise and infrastructure, resulting in severe logistical challenges and ultimately resulting in inadequate testing. There is a critical need for diagnostics that can be rapidly deployed at the point-of-need (PON) to enable global surveillance of infectious diseases. Towards addressing this need, this project incorporates a new CRISPR-based approach called CRISPR Isothermal Amplification (CIA) that enables one-pot diagnostic amplification and detection of the SARC-CoV-2 virus at ambient temperatures. This scheme builds off innovations in cell-free synthetic biology and biosensing that enable rapid, low-cost, and PON detection of chemical contaminants and viral pathogens. The platform technology under development could serve several purposes from a quick-screen technology to inform triage and isolation strategies, to a clinical test used on the front lines. There is also the potential for the technology to eventually serve as an at-home test to help inform which subpopulations and sectors of the economy could safely return to productivity towards the end of the pandemic. In addition, the test has the flexibility to be rapidly reprogrammed to detect new emerging pathogens. This work is pursued in close collaboration with a commercial partner, Stemloop, Inc., in order to quickly transition the technology for manufacturing, deployment, and distribution.<br/><br/>This project employs a new CRISPR Isothermal Amplification (CIA) approach to enable a one-pot amplification and detection of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in an assay for the virus. CIA uses programmed Cas 13 systems to recognize SARS-CoV-2 RNA, trigger nucleic acid amplification and create a detectable output simultaneously in the same reaction where amplification occurs. Computational models of each process are developed alongside the experimental systems and used to guide optimizations to achieve attomolar sensitivity.

258    Dr. TEICHMANN Sarah    EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LABORATORY    2016-01-01    2020-12-31    Re(defining) CD4+ T Cell Identities One Cell at a Time    The immune system consists of a complex continuum of cell types that communicate with each other and non-immune tissues in homeostasis, and during infections, autoimmunity and cancer. Conventional transcriptional and functional profiling enabled by cell surface marker sorting has revealed a great deal about how specific cell types operate en masse, yet important transcriptional heterogeneity that exists within cell populations remains unexplored. High-throughput single cell RNA-seq can overcome this limitation by profiling entire transcriptomes of thousands of individual cells, revealing cell-to-cell variation by decoding patterns within populations masked in bulk transcriptomes. We will exploit this to dissect the mouse CD4+ T cell compartment, a heterogeneous white blood cell population that initiates adaptive immune responses. In AIM 1, we will chart the dynamics of in vivo CD4+ cell states in mouse before, during and after immune response challenges. By sequencing thousands of single cell transcriptomes, we will map the landscape of CD4+ T cell states in an unbiased, quantitative and comprehensive way. In AIM 2, we will predict key transcription factors, cell surface markers, and signalling molecules, including cytokines/chemokines in each cell state through novel computational approaches. Furthermore, our analyses will establish regulatory modules and networks of gene-gene interactions active in immune responses. In AIM 3, we will (a) confirm the in vivo impact of new cell states by performing adoptive cell transfer assays; and (b) validate our predictions of regulatory molecules and interactions using a massively parallel CRISPR/Cas knockout screen in vitro. This powerful integrated approach combines single cell RNA-sequencing, bioinformatics and genetic engineering to dissect CD4+ T cell states, a central compartment of mammalian adaptive immunity, and reveal basic principles of gene regulation.

259    Prof. Dr. HERZOG Sebastian    Medical University of Innsbruck    2017-04-01    2021-03-31    Molecular regulation of the oncogenic miR-17-92 cluster    MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-coding RNAs that mediate posttranscriptional silencing of a predicted 60% of protein-coding genes in mammals. A tremendous amount of work in the last decade has unraveled the basic concepts underlying their regulatory role in almost all physiological processes, however, we are far from understanding how exactly miRNAs are integrated into the regulatory circuits that ultimately control gene expression. Intriguingly, since MiRNA research has traditionally focused on the molecular events downstream of the miRNA, i.e. the identification of target genes that are actively repressed and thus establish a defined phenotype, the upstream regulatory networks that feed into miRNA activity have been largely neglected. With few exceptions, it is largely unknown which signaling cascades feed into the transcription of certain miRNAs and which transcription factors directly affect pri-miRNA synthesis. Second, we only have a limited understanding about processes that specifically regulate miRNA biogenesis. Third, we lack insight into how miRNA decay/turnover is specifically regulated and thus allows precise fine-tuning of active miRNA levels, warranting an in-depth analysis. To acquire a comprehensive understanding of the molecular components and mechanisms that and control miRNA activity, we plan to perform an unbiased whole genome CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss-of-function screen. Focusing on the clinically and therapeutically relevant miR-17-92 cluster as, we expect that this innovative strategy will unravel numerous novel general and miRNA-specific regulatory mechanisms that determine the level of functional miRNAs within a cell. Our work program is divided into three parts. In a first step, we plan to conduct several independent CRISPR/Cas9 screens to identify novel genes with a regulatory impact on miRNA activity. These screens are based on the direct quantification of changes in miRNA activity, which is accomplished by highly specific GFP-based sensors, in combination with fluorescent cell sorting. By using sensors for all members of the miR-17-92 cluster as well as several unspecific miRNA sensors, we expect to find novel genes implicated in general miRNA regulation, but also cluster-specific and even individual miRNA-specific regulatory genes. Second, we will validate and then characterize the most interesting candidate genes in more detail. In particular, we aim to pinpoint at which level these genes affect miRNA activity, and will use a combination of biochemical, genetic and molecular tools to unravel the mechanisms underlying their function. Last, we will test the top hits from the screen for their in vivo regulatory potential. To do so, we will manipulate the expression of such genes in an established adoptive transfer tumor model, the Eµ-myc model of lymphoma, and will monitor whether this positively or negatively impacts disease onset and penetrance. Together, we expect that these studies will form the basis for a comprehensive understanding of the molecular events upstream of miR-17-92 both under physiological as well as under pathophysiological conditions. This will not only shed light onto the cellular networks that ultimately determine miRNA activity and thus shape gene expression, but may also lay the groundwork for therapeutic approaches that target miRNAs to manipulate disease-related transcriptional programs.

260    Prof. Dr. HERZOG Sebastian    Medical University of Innsbruck    2017-09-01    2021-02-28    Unraveling miR-15 function in health and disease    MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-coding RNAs that mediate posttranscriptional silencing of a predicted 60% of protein-coding genes in mammals. A tremendous amount of work in the last decade has unraveled the basic concepts underlying their regulatory role in almost all physiological processes, however, we are far from understanding how exactly miRNAs reprogram transcriptional circuits, fine-tune cellular behavior and impact on human disease. Here, I plan to provide a comprehensive functional in vivo analysis of the established tumor-suppressive miR-15 family, consisting of the three highly conserved miR-15a/16-1, miR-15b/16-2 and miR-497/195 clusters. Research in the past years has mainly studied the miR-15 family in the context of cancer, e.g. in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which is characterized by a loss of the miR-15a/16-1 cluster in about 60 % of all cases. However, little is known about its function under physiological conditions, warranting an in-depth analysis. Our own data in early B cell development as well as recent studies in NK cells, cardiomyocytes neurons indicate that miR-15 members are involved in tasks that are characterized by a delicate balance between proliferation vs. cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis vs. survival. Given its widespread expression in almost all tissues, we therefore hypothesize that the miR-15 family may function as a general regulator of tissue homeostasis, stem cell function or developmental processes. Intriguingly, mouse models for the deletion of either miR-15a/16-1 and miR-15b/16-2 recapitulate the human pathology and develop a CLL-like disease, but show almost no additional phenotypes, indicating that the miR-15 family can compensate for the loss of one or two members under homeostatic conditions in most tissues. Hence, all miR-15 family members may need to be targeted to provoke a strong effect on cellular function. To address this, we have used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to generate a mouse model for the conditional inactivation of all clusters, i.e. miR-15a/16-1, miR-15b/16-2 and miR-497/195. In this proposal, we plan to use this innovative model to decipher the functional role of the miR-15 family under physiological and pathophysiological conditions in vivo, mainly focusing on hematopoiesis and immune cell function as experimental systems. In particular, we will use flow cytometry for extensive immunophenotyping of all hematopoietic compartments in immune cell-specific miR-15 knockout mice, both throughout development and under steady state conditions. This will be complemented by functional assays to determine whether terminal differentiation and effector functions of immune cells are compromised. In addition, we plan to perform a thorough analysis of hematopoietic stem cell function to investigate whether miR-15 family members regulate the delicate balance of stem cell quiescence, expansion and differentiation. Beyond the immune system, we furthermore plan to pinpoint the role of the miR-15 family in non-hematopoietic tissues, e.g. during embryogenesis, and also want to determine whether loss of the miR-15 family promotes spontaneous tumor development or accelerate disease onset in cancer-prone mouse strains. Together, we expect that these studies will form the basis for a comprehensive functional understanding of the miR-15 family under physiological conditions in vivo, and will also allow a more precise assessment of its role in established or newly unraveled miR-15-related pathologies. In the long term, this may be crucial for the development of miRNA-based approaches to manipulate disease-related transcriptional programs.

The equipment must be housed in a facility with electricity and freezers for storage of temperature sensitive materials and equipment operation. Lateral flow based assays are an alternative diagnostic tool that is inexpensive, temperature stable, user-friendly and has a faster turn-around-time (TAT). However, this platform takes longer to develop, with reduced specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy compared to molecular-based assays. An ideal diagnostic tool combines the adaptability and reliability of molecular assays with the TAT, cost-effectiveness, and stability of lateral flow. Clustered Regularly Interspersed Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) based diagnostics can provide these capabilities and revolutionize the field of point-of-need molecular-based diagnostics. Our goal is to develop CRISPR-based diagnostics to detect SARS-CoV-2 at the point-of-need, such as at the bedside, passenger screening, or returning travellers who may have been exposed. We recently demonstrated that CRISPR-based diagnostics is reliable, sensitive and can be used to detect Ebola virus and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and caused more than 69,000 infections and contributed to over 1600 deaths. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to quickly diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection to administer appropriate patient care and isolation. CRISPR-based diagnostics is a next-generation diagnostic tool that can provide results in a timely manner and fill this gap. Implementation of CRISPR-based diagnostics will complement our armamentarium against high-consequence pathogens and will address the need for faster, cheaper, and more robust diagnostics for emerging infectious diseases of public health concern.

In particular it will address the role of the actin nucleator JMY, a p53 co-factor that impacts of autophagosome formation, cell motility and survival in autophagy-mediated effects on cell survival and the role of actin nucleation. Specific goals during the duration of the funding: -assess autophagy levels (both basal and induced) in cancer cells lines and correlate with cell motility and invasion (also assessing cell survival and adhesion/motility events, using impedance measurements, to distinguish between effects on proliferation vs motility). -Assess impact of JMY on autophagy-mediated motility (using specific mutants to distinguish autophagosome targeted vs not, and Arp2/3-independent vs dependent actin nucleation. -Assess impact of modulating autophagy levels on cell motility (i.e., through siRNA/CRISPR-Cas9 targetting of JMY and autophagy initiator proteins and small molecule inhibitors of various stages in autophagosome formation).

In skin and lung cancers, they often result from exposure to environmental mutagens such as cigarette smoke or UV light; however, in other cancers, their causes remain unexplained. Restoration of DNA-repair in mice with BRCA1-deficiency prevents tumour formation revealing that defective DNA-repair contributes to cancer. The Alternative-Non-Homologous-End-Joining (A-EJ) pathway has recently been discovered and shown to promote genome instability and therapy resistance in BRCA1-deficient cancers but only few components of A-EJ pathway are known. In addition the causes of their activation remain elusive. Inhibition of A-EJ could be an effective therapy for cancers associated with DNA repair deficiency. In pump-priming experiments that will establish proof of concept for my new laboratory in the UK, I will develop novel quantitative laboratory assay for A-EJ employing cutting-edge CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, high-throughput sequencing and machine learning algorithm. My long-term goal is to elucidate A-EJ regulation, to identify new members of the A-EJ pathway and to define its mutational footprints that will serve as a biomarker of DNA repair deficiency. The outcomes of this seed funding will enable me to secure long-term funding to study A-EJ in cancer and its potential in cancer stratification and personalized therapy.

266    Dr. NIVARTHI Harini    CeMM- Center for Molecular Medicine    2017-06-01    2020-05-31    Mechanism of CALR mutants in Myeloproliferative Neoplasms    Molecular Mechanism of CALR Mutations in Myeloproliferative Neoplasms “Frameshift” mutations in the CALR gene are seen in about 25% of patients suffering from myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), specifically in those suffering from Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) and Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF). CALR encodes for the protein calreticulin, which is a chaperone in the Endoplasmic Reticulum. We have recently shown that the CALR mutant proteins physically interact with the Thrombopoietin Receptor (MPL), thereby activating it in a ligand-independent manner. This results in the downstream activation of the JAK-STAT pathway. However, the molecular mechanisms of the oncogenic program driven by the CALR mutations is not completely understood. The elucidation of these molecular details will not only help in understanding the biology of these mutations, but will also provide a foundation for the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Towards this, we have generated a transgenic mouse model with a conditional ‘knock-in’ of the human CALR-del52 mutant within the mouse endogenous CALR locus. The mice develop an ET phenotype at the age of 8 weeks. We propose to characterize development of the MPN phenotype in these mice with age. This will be done by assessing the peripheral blood values, FACS analysis of the hematopoietic tissues, assessment of splenomegaly and by histology of the bone marrow (for fibrosis development). Bone marrow transplantation experiments will be performed to evaluate the stem cell cell-intrinsic requirement of the CALR mutants and engraftment capabilities. As the CALR mutant proteins induce the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, we propose to genetically (using JAK2 and STAT5 conditional knock-out mice) and pharmacologically (using JAK2 inhibitor - Ruxolitinib) interfere with this pathway, to assess the requirement of this pathway for the oncogenic function of CALR mutant proteins. To elucidate the oncogenic program of mutant CALR, we will perform a transcriptome analysis of the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) isolated from these mice. Differential expression analysis will be performed with state of the art bioinformatics tools, to identify the genes/pathways most relevant for CALR mutant driven disease. The relevance of these genes to mutant CALR oncogenicity will be tested using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. A low-complexity gRNA pool will be generated against the most significantly upregulated/downregulated genes and will be expressed (lentivirally) in the HSCs of CALR-del52;Rosa-Cas9 transgenic mice. The transduced cells will be transplanted into recipient NSG mice and the most depleted/enriched gRNAs will be identified by performing Next Generation Sequencing. The most interesting hits will be further validated in vitro (Ba/F3 cells) and in vivo using over-expression/knock-out mouse models. This study will be performed within a period of 3 years.

267    Dr Kilpinen Helena    University College London    2018-01-02    2020-01-02    Genetic background effects in human iPSCs and iPSC-derived cell types    Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) have emerged as a key model system to study the function of genetic variants, as they provide access to relevant cell types and developmental lineages through cellular differentiation. However, while it has been shown that the genetic background of the donor individual has an effect on molecular phenotypes measured from iPSCs, it is currently not known how much the genetic background influences studies that use iPSCs to model rare disease mutations, making interpretation of results challenging. In this project, I will use CRISPR-Cas9 technology to study specific rare disease mutations in different genetic backgrounds. Specifically, I will focus on loss-of-function mutations causing Kabuki syndrome, a disorder of the epigenetic machinery, and use patient-derived iPSCs together with engineered mutant and control lines to quantify the contribution of the genetic background on the transcriptome and epigenome of the iPSCs as well as neuronal precursor cells derived from them. This project will establish the value of using patient-derived iPSCs over generic iPSC lines with engineered mutations. This information is critical for the design of any subsequent studies in which iPSCs serve as the baseline, such as directed differentiation experiments and therapeutic targeting of the mutation.

268    Dr Tumbarello David    University of Southampton    2017-05-02    2019-05-02    Investigating the mechanisms of Parkin-mediated mitophagy    Determining how cells maintain homeostasis under times of stress is vital to understanding a wide-range of disorders, from neurodegenerative diseases to cardiomyopathies. Autophagy is a catabolic cytosolic pathway that functions to degrade damaged organelles and mis-folded proteins, while providing a protective mechanism under stress. Mitophagy, the selective autophagic pathway for mitochondria limits oxidative stress by degrading damaged mitochondria through a mechanism involving ubiquitylation and recruitment of autophagic machinery. One mechanism of mitophagy, which is dysregulated during Parkinson’s disease, is the PINK1-parkin pathway. In this proposal, we will identify and characterise regulators of parkin which facilitate its recruitment to mitochondria. We will focus on an adaptor protein complex Tollip-Tom1, which has been suggested to be linked to this process, and which functions to regulate trafficking along both the endolysosomal and autophagic pathways. We will utilise microscopic imaging and biochemical assays to dissect the spatiotemporal regulation of parkin-mediated mitophagy following targeted loss of function of Tom1 and Tollip. In addition, we will utilise CRISPR-Cas9 technology, coupled to cDNA reconstitution experiments, and primary patient-derived fibroblasts to understand mechanisms of parkin recruitment following mitochondrial damage. The outcomes will provide crucial mechanisms of how cells regulate PINK1-parkin mediated mitophagy in order to maintain their health.    Wellcome Trust    Seed Award in Science    99277.0GBP
269    Dr. JUNKER Jan Philipp    Max Delbrueck Center for Molecular Medicine    2017-01-01    2021-12-31    Quantitative analysis of variability and robustness in spatial pattern formation    During embryonic development a single cell turns into a complex organism. This process is characterized by an antagonism between variation and stability. On the one hand, development is a tightly controlled process; tissues need to be specified at the right time, at the correct spatial position, and with a defined size. On the other hand, regulation should not be too rigid, since embryos need to adjust to environmental perturbations and correct errors caused by noisy gene expression. We will study variation and stability during pattern formation in the zebrafish heart. We seek to understand the origin of embryo-to-embryo variability as well as robustness against perturbation. The zebrafish heart is a powerful model system for studying variability, since heart positioning is inverted along the left/right axis in 5-10% of wildtype embryos. We aim to identify the mechanism underlying variability in heart positioning and understand its function. To this end, we will combine two innovative approaches: Tomo-seq, a novel method for spatially-resolved transcriptomics developed by the applicant; and single-molecule FISH, a technique that allows absolute quantification of gene expression in single cells. To expand our study of embryo-to-embryo variability beyond gene expression analysis, we will optimize a method for massively parallel single-cell lineage tracing based on CRISPR-Cas. This novel approach will allow us to study embryo-to-embryo variability in developmental lineage specification on the single cell level. We will use this strategy to systematically explore the corrective capacity of the zebrafish heart upon perturbation of progenitor cell pools, and to determine which mechanisms for error correction are activated in the embryo. These quantitative experiments will provide unprecedented insight into variability and robustness during development. The concepts developed here will also be relevant for improving our understanding of variable outcomes in human disease.    European Research Council    Starting Grant    1499883.0EUR
270    Dr. LINK Hannes Peter    Max Planck Society    2017-01-01    2021-12-31    Mapping metabolic regulators at a genome-scale to switch bacteria from growth to overproduction of chemicals    Metabolic engineering creates improved microbes for industrial biotechnology. Rational design of industrial microbes centres on modifications of genes with known roles in the production pathway of interest. However, genes that are unrelated to the production pathway are also known to substantially impact productivity. To date there are no methods that allow the prediction of such distal genes on a rational basis. Effects of distal genes are indirect, and mediated through regulatory interactions between metabolites and proteins, most of which are currently unknown even in the well-studied microbe Escherichia coli. The lack of knowledge of metabolite-protein interactions thus effectively prohibits systematic exploration of distal regulatory relationships, with the consequence that models used to predict metabolic engineering targets are severely limited and rarely applied in industrial biotechnology. Previously, we used small-scale metabolic models and metabolomics to infer metabolite-protein interactions in specific pathways. In this project we propose a novel genome-wide endeavor to map metabolite-protein interactions across the entire metabolic network. For this purpose, we will use the recently developed CRISPR interference system to quantitatively perturb >900 single metabolic genes in E. coli. Combining the metabolomics data of these >900 gene perturbations with a genome-scale metabolic model will enable us to infer functionally relevant metabolite-protein interactions. Finally, we will apply this knowledge to the model-guided metabolic engineering of superior E. coli strains. Specifically, we want E. coli to cease growth upon induction and focus all its metabolic resources towards synthesis of succinic acid. This controlled uncoupling of growth from overproduction on a rational basis will break new grounds in metabolic engineering and opens up novel applications in industrial biotechnology.

271    Dr. Kramann Rafael Johannes Thomas    University Hospital Aachen    2016-05-01    2021-04-30    Targeting perivascular myofibroblast progenitors to treat cardiac fibrosis and heart failure in chronic kidney disease    Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing public health problem with a massively increased cardiovascular mortality. Patients with advanced CKD mostly die from sudden cardiac death and recurrent heart failure due to premature cardiac aging with hypertrophy, fibrosis, and capillary rarefaction. I have recently identified the long sought key cardiac myofibroblast progenitor population, an emerging breakthrough that carries the potential to develop novel targeted therapeutics. Genetic ablation of these Gli1\ perivascular progenitors ameliorates fibrosis, cardiac hypertrophy and rescues left-ventricular function. I propose that Gli1\ cells are critically involved in all major pathophysiologic changes in cardiac aging and uremic cardiomyopathy including fibrosis, hypertrophy and capillary rarefaction. I will perform state of the art genetic fate tracing, ablation and in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing experiments to untangle their complex mechanism of activation and communication with endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes promoting fibrosis, capillary rarefaction, cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. To identify novel druggable targets I will utilize new mouse models that allow comparative transcript and proteasome profiling assays of these critical myofibroblast precusors in homeostasis, aging and premature aging in CKD. Novel assays with immortalized cardiac Gli1\ cells will allow high throughput screens to identify uremia associated factors of cell activation and inhibitory compounds to facilitate the development of novel therapeutics. This ambitious interdisciplinary project requires the expertise of chemists, physiologists, biomedical researchers and physician scientists to develop novel targeted therapies in cardiac remodeling during aging and CKD. The passion that drives this project results from a simple emerging hypothesis: It is possible to treat heart failure and sudden cardiac death in aging and CKD by targeting perivascular myofibroblast progenitors.

272    Dr Elias Salah Karim    University of Southampton    2018-12-01    2020-12-01    Uncovering the Molecular Mechanisms of Asymmetric Cell Divisions in Mammalian Adult Epithelia    Loss of asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs) regulation in the normal self-renewing stem cells is entwined with the growth and progression of poorly differentiated cancers. Yet, the molecular mechanisms controlling the execution of symmetric versus asymmetric divisions in adult epithelia are still unfolding. We recently demonstrated that KIF5/kinesin-1 is essential for mammary epithelial cell divisions and cytoarchitecture by governing the trafficking of the spindle orientation and apical polarity components, respectively. Whether KIF5/kinesin-1 couples spindle orientation and polarity machineries during mitosis to promote ACDs; and whether other mechanisms are involved remain open questions. Here, we will address these questions in mammary 3D organoids. We will use CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to generate cells expressing AID-tagged endogenous KIF5/kinesin-1 to allow inducible and rapid degradation of the microtubule motor specifically during mitosis, for a precise evaluation of the role it plays in ACDs. We generated cells expressing GFP-tagged LGN –a key player in the spindle orientation machinery–to purify and analyse the LGN-containing complex by LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry and identify novel factors that participate to ACDs. These studies will elucidate the molecular mechanisms of ACDs in the mammary epithelia and provide rational for subsequent detailed investigations in vivo of their precise roles in development and homeostasis.

273    Dr. van Spriel Annemiek    Radboud University Nijmegen    2017-10-01    2022-09-30    The cell surface tetraspanin web drives tumour development and alters metabolic signalling    Cancer development is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation, cell survival and metabolic reprogramming. Tumour cells are surrounded by a fluid-mosaic membrane that contains tetraspanins (Tspans) which are evolutionary conserved proteins important in the formation of multiprotein complexes at the cell surface (‘tetraspanin web’). Increasing evidence indicates that Tspans are involved in cancer, still the architecture of the Tspan web in native tumour membranes and its (patho)physiological functions have not been resolved. Based on my preliminary data, I hypothesize that tumour cells contain a disrupted Tspan web in which Tspan interactions are modified leading to aberrant metabolic signalling and tumour development. This is supported by my discovery that loss of Tspan CD37 leads to spontaneous lymphomagenesis due to activation of the Akt survival pathway. The overall aim of Secret Surface is to unravel the composition, physiological functions and molecular mechanisms of the Tspan web on tumour development and clinical outcome. To achieve this, I will focus on studying lymphomas using a multidisciplinary approach: I. Detailed analyses of Tspan web composition in lymphoma to select clinically relevant Tspans (high-throughput tissue microarray technology, multispectral imaging). II. Resolve the endogenous Tspan web on lymphoma cells (super-resolution microscopy), and generation and analysis of lymphoma cells that have a complete deficiency of multiple Tspans (CRISPR/Cas9 technology). III. Decipher molecular mechanisms underlying Tspan web function in lymphoma cells (membrane organization, membrane-proximal signalling, metabolic reprogramming). With my unique toolbox of Tspan knock-outs coupled to advanced microscopy and metabolic studies, I expect that Secret Surface will lead to a new concept in cellular physiology in which cell surface organization by the Tspan web drives tumour development, which may open new horizons for the generation of new cancer therapies.

276    Dr Conduit Paul    University of Cambridge    2015-04-01    2020-06-17    Investigating the spatiotemporal regulation of microtubule nucleation in Drosophila.    Microtubules are dynamic polymers that have crucial roles in many eukaryotic cell processes. They are nucleated by multi-protein gamma-TuRCs that are concentrated at various MTOCs within the cell. Although most, if not all, of the gamma-TuRC components are known, it remains unclear how gamma-TuRCs are recruited to different MTOCs at different times during development and during the cell cycle. Moreover, it is not clear how each component functions in the complex. Previous studies have concentrat ed on specific gamma-TuRC components or cell types, and have often studied only mitotic processes. I will use Drosophila as a model to conduct a comprehensive in vivo analysis of gamma-TuRC biology in various cell types, including mitotic cells, developing oocytes and terminally differentiated neurons. Mutant and fluorescently tagged lines exist for most, but not all, of the gamma-TuRC components and I intend to complete this toolset using CRISPR, a novel and rapid genome engineering technique t hat works very efficiently in flies. By studying a range of cell types and examining the role of all gamma-TuRC components, I hope to gain a better understanding of how microtubule nucleation is regulated in space and time throughout animal development.

277    Dr. Westra Edze    University of Exeter    2016-07-01    2018-06-30    Putative gene regulatory functions of Csy1, a component of the CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune system, in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa.    It is becoming increasingly clear that CRISPR-Cas (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; CRISPR associated) systems function beyond adaptive immunity. Preliminary data show that CRISPR-Cas deletion from Pseudomonas aeruginosa reduces both in vitro fitness and in vivo virulence. These phenotypes are caused by Csy1, a Cas protein thought to be involved in sequence-specific binding of the 5'-handle of crRNA. We hypothesise that Csy1 regulates expression of genes carrying sequen ce motifs similar to the 5'-handle. We will test this hypothesis by (1) transcriptome analysis of WT and Csy1 deletion mutants, (2) RIP-seq analysis of RNA co-purifying with Csy1 and (3) EMSA to measure sequence specificity of Csy1-RNA interactions. This project will reveal whether Csy1 of the P. aeruginosa CRISPR-Cas system is involved in a gene regulation function and will identify specific RNA motifs targeted by Csy1. If successful, the data from this seed project will serve as a basis for a full grant proposal aimed at (1) validating the Csy1-motif interactions in vivo (2) generalising Csy1-mediated gene regulation across P. aeruginosa strains and (3) testing the impact of Csy1 on P. aeruginosa virulence in other, more relevant, infection models, such as cell culture and thermally injured mouse infection models.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are pre-leukaemic disorders that reflect an early-stage malignancy with the potential to progress to acute leukaemia. We have previously demonstrated that MPN-derived tumour cells exhibit perturbations in DNA replication that lead to DNA damage. We now have exciting preliminary data implicating nucleic acid structures called “R-loops” as the primary cause of MPN-associated genomic instability. R-loops are essential for multiple normal cellular processes but can also promote DNA damage if inappropriately regulated. This seed award application is focused on a central question: why do R-loops promote DNA damage in MPN cells but not normal cells? To address this issue, we will undertake two thematically-related but non-overlapping streams of investigations. For Aim 1, we will use an unbiased proteomics-based approach to characterise any differences in protein composition of R-loops between normal and MPN cells. For Aim 2, we will perform a pooled CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic screen to identify genes that modulate how MPN cells regulate R-loop-induced recombination. Cumulatively, we hope to generate preliminary data that starts to deconvolute the structural and functional complexity of R-loops in leukaemia development.

281    Dr. Brouns Stan    WAGENINGEN UNIVERSITY    2015-06-01    2020-06-01    Adaptive immunity in prokaryotes: how Bacteria do not forgive and do not forget their enemies    Microbes in natural ecosystems are under constant evolutionary pressure from viruses. To survive in this hostile environment microbes have evolved an adaptive immune system called CRISPR-Cas. The immune system is based on incorporation of invader DNA sequences in a memory locus (CRISPR), the formation of guide RNAs from this locus, and the degradation of invading target DNA using CRISPR RNA-guided protein complexes. Invaders escape immunity by making point mutations in the targeted region of their DNA, but hosts quickly restore immunity by integrating new memory sequences against the same invader in a process called priming. Recently, I have made the remarkable discovery that hosts mount a primed immune response even when facing heavily mutated invaders. This implies that the memory of the CRISPR-Cas system not only functions in the short term against relatively recent threats, but also remembers a range of revisiting old foes in the long term, providing a huge evolutionary benefit for the host in the arms race with their invaders. This proposal sets out to determine the mechanism of the enigmatic process of primed memory formation against heavily mutated invaders. Using a combination of genetic, biochemical and structural approaches, including state-of-the-art single molecule imaging of CRISPR immunity in living Escherichia coli cells, I will investigate the driving hypothesis that perfectly matching and degenerate targets are differentially recognized, and trigger either target DNA degradation or priming. Moreover, I will test the supposition that degenerate priming is a universal phenomenon among different CRISPR-Cas types. If this is the case, degenerate priming will impair the use of viruses as therapeutic agents to treat antibiotic resistant bacterial infections. To prevent CRISPR resistance I propose to screen for organic molecules that inhibit the formation of CRISPR resistance. These molecules can be co-administered with viruses to potentiate treatments.    European Research Council    Starting Grant    1499184.0EUR

283    Dr. FUCHS Peter    University of Vienna    2018-01-01    2021-06-30    Is epiplakin a true keratin chaperone?    Epiplakin is a member of a family of cytoskeletal linker proteins called plakins. It is characterized by an unusual structure comprising of 16 plakin repeat domains in mice, an expression restricted to epithelial tissues, and binding to intermediate filaments, which are the only binding partners identified so far. Epiplakin-deficient mice did not show any discernible phenotype, except for a slight acceleration of keratinocyte migration. Recently we could show that in several pancreas and liver stress models, epiplakin and keratin expression was upregulated in parallel. In addition, epiplakin-deficient mice suffered from aggravated injuries and their diseased organs contained larger amounts of keratin aggregates and exhibited increased soluble keratin levels. Similar phenotypes found in primary epiplakin-deficient hepatocytes could be rescued by treatment with a chemical chaperone. Our data provide strong evidence that epiplakin is a protective protein in stress situations when keratin expression is upregulated, probably by acting as keratin organizer preventing formation of harmful keratin aggregates in a chaperone-like manner. In this project, we want to further elucidate these proposed functions of epiplakin in simple epithelia by performing a combination of approaches using mutant mouse lines, advanced bio-optical analyses of cultured cells, and biochemical methods. For the mouse work we plan to generate several double transgenic lines to investigate whether keratin expression levels are crucial for phenotypes observed in epiplakin-deficient mice. For the bio-optical part, the main goal is to tag full length epiplakin and keratins with fluorophores to monitor their subcellular localization and dynamics in living cells. In addition, in-vitro interaction studies will be performed with full-length epiplakin and keratins. For all these experiments we will use advanced techniques including the CrispR/Cas9 technology which enables the insertion of tags in the genome of cell lines. This project will be mainly executed by two PhD students and supported by our collaboration partners Rudolf Leube, Pavel Strnad, Gerhard Wiche, and Bishr Omary, who will provide tools and technical expertise. With this team, I expect to be able to reveal how epiplakin fulfils its proposed keratin-chaperoning functions. Epiplakin could finally turn out to be a keratin-interacting protein which is exerting core functions in the keratin cycle, in particular when filament turn-over is upregulated in stressed tissues. Such data would increase our knowledge about the mechanisms responsible for the in vivo assembly, disassembly, network organization, and dynamics of keratins, which are to date not as well understood as those for actin filaments and microtubules. Though until now no human epiplakin mutations causing pathologies were described, I expect that our findings will trigger and facilitate the search for patients showing such mutations, which could turn out to be disease modifiers or risk factors for the establishment of pathologies like chronic diseases of the gastrointestinal tract.

284    Dr. FUCHS Peter    University of Manchester    2017-01-12    2019-04-12    Development of new experimental models to understand the genetic basis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA)    5.4 million people have asthma in the UK with over 100,000 at risk on developing allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). ABPA is a progressive lung disease caused by the mayor fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. Although the disease is not usually fatal, the economic costs are >£10 billion in the UK per year. ABPA affects people with a defective airway epithelial function such as asthmatics. However, the percentage of patients developing ABPA is <2.5%. Genetic factors for the development of disease have not been defined so far. The Manchester Fungal Infection Group, has performed a whole exome sequencing project to investigate genetic variants in ABPA patients that might play a crucial role for the development of this disease. Some of these variants are involved in avoiding A.fumigatus to grow in the respiratory airways. However, functional validation of these at risk factors is need. Transgenic animal models have been used to study genetic predisposing factors in infectious diseases. However, non-animal models will contribute significantly for the replacement of animals in biological research. A cell culture model to study the pathology of ABPA using cells carrying the specific mutations discovered in our genetics project will improve our understanding of this disease and will supply enough information to select genes for the development of new diagnostic test. This training fellowship will define whether in vitro and ex vivo models can contribute to this aim by: (i) Recreating specific gene variants associated to ABPA in monocyte and bronchial epithelial cells by CRISPR/Cas9 system and testing their role in Aspergillus persistence and allergic response. (ii) Studying the interaction between epithelial cells and macrophages to define which cell subset and genetic risk factor orchestrates the ABPA-response.(iii) Validating candidate genetic variants in primary cells from patients with known genetic background.

285    Dr Sancho Rocio    King's College London    2017-10-09    2019-10-09    Uncovering the molecular and cellular heterogeneity of pancreatic ductal cells    Recent data suggest that pancreatic ductal cells have a latent capacity for regeneration; however, the molecular regulation of this potential is completely unexplored. I have recently optimised ex vivo pancreatic organoids as an efficient and tractable system to study the effect of perturbations on ductal cell fate. I now propose to use organoids to characterise the cell types coexisting in the ductal compartment that are permissive or non-permissive for changing cell fate change, and the molecular pathways involved. Differentiation will be induced by Ngn3/Pdx1/MafA overexpression or by medium containing differentiation inducing factors. My goals are as follows: 1) Use transcriptomics to delineate different cell types in ductal INS-GFP organoids to identify markers of reprogramming-competent cells; 2) Compare RNASeq profiles of reprogrammed, intermediate, and unchanged organoid cells to reveal genes required for cell fate change; and 3) Perform a Crispr/Cas9-based loss of function screen to identify the crucial signaling pathways involved in duct cell fate maintenance, using CK19-Cherry as a marker of ductal cell fate. These results will elucidate the fundamental biology of pancreatic ductal cell plasticity and provide clues for how to unlock the regenerative capacity of pancreatic ductal cells in vivo for future therapies.

286    Dr Przewloka Marcin    University of Southampton    2018-12-01    2020-12-01    Novel Role of a Protein Phosphatase in Chromosome Segregation    Kinases and their antagonistic phosphatases both provide a key regulatory mechanism controlling many cellular events. Yet our molecular understanding of phosphatases lags behind. Recently we described an interaction between Protein Phosphatase 4 (PP4) and Drosophila centromeres, which when disrupted affects the mitotic centromere integrity and spindle assembly checkpoint activity. The details of this pathway remain to be elucidated. Nor is it known how this finding relates to PP4's de-regulation in many cancers. I will therefore turn to human cell line model to address these questions. Towards determining human PP4’s mitotic functions, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing will be used to generate cell lines expressing endogenous PP4 fused with the AID tag allowing for inducible and rapid degradation of the phosphatase. This approach will facilitate PP4 removal specifically in mitotic cells, the effects of which will be characterised by cell imaging. Parallel studies, including proteomics, will deliver precise information on the human PP4 interaction network and behaviour during mitosis. Together these data will reveal the affected processes and provide a "blueprint" for subsequent detailed investigations that identify the involved pathways, PP4-specific substrates and their phospho-regulatory sites. The results of this study will be later placed within a larger investigatory framework dissecting chromosome segregation.    Wellcome Trust    Seed Award in Science    100000.0GBP
287    Dr McIntyre Alan    University of Nottingham    2017-08-01    2020-07-30    Target Validation and Functional Analysis of BET proteins In Hypoxic TNBC Tumours    Breast cancer is responsible for 500,000 deaths per year worldwide. Hypoxia (low oxygen) is found in >50% of breast tumours, and is more frequently found in the more aggressive triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype which is associated with worse patient survival. Hypoxia drives TNBC progression, promoting adaptation through genes regulating the major hallmarks of cancer. Clinically, hypoxia is associated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance and worse patient survival. Identifying ways to target hypoxic tumours is a key objective to improve therapeutic response. Hypoxia drives molecular adaptation through the HIF1α and HIF2α transcription factors. Attempts to target HIF directly have had limited success, however we showed that JQ1 an inhibitor of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins (BRD2-4 and BRDT), which are histone acetylation “readers”, reduced the expression of 44% of hypoxia-induced genes in TNBC, and reduced tumour growth in vivo . Aims We aim to understand which BET proteins regulate hypoxic molecular adaptation. We propose that targeting an individual BET protein will yield greater anti-hypoxic tumour effects. We will examine the requirement for individual BET proteins for survival and growth in the hypoxic microenvironment in vitro and in vivo . Finally we will analyse genome wide BET protein DNA binding and histone acetylation in hypoxia. Techniques and Methodology This project will use biochemical studies and CRISPR CAS9 genome editing and ChIP-Seq to determine which BET proteins are essential for HIF-mediated hypoxic adaptation, interrogating mechanistic aspects of hypoxic gene expression, growth and survival in hypoxia. We will evaluate the impact of an individual BET protein knockdown in a xenograft model using in vivo imaging. Impact on breast cancer research This work will provide a greater comprehension of hypoxic TNBC gene expression regulation and proof of concept data to accelerate the development of BET inhibitors as new leads for TNBC.

288    Dr McIntyre Alan    University of Zurich    2016-04-01    2019-03-31    Signalübertragung während der Vulva-Entwicklung von Caenorhabditis elegans    Background:Research on vulval development has provided fundamental insights into the molecular and cellular processes controlling organogenesis. Thanks to its relative simplicity, the C. elegans vulva has become a paradigm to study the mechanisms of cell fate specification, proliferation and morphogenesis during development. During vulval fate specification, the combined action of the EGFR/RAS/MAPK, WNT and NOTCH signaling pathways induces three vulval precursor cells (VPCs) to adopt an invariant pattern of cell fates. Then, the three induced VPCs begin to proliferate and generate 22 terminally differentiated vulval cells. At the same time, vulval morphogenesis begins. The vulval cell invaginate to generate a lumen and extend circumferential extensions to form seven ring-shaped toroids that build a tubular organ.Preliminary results:We have conducted several forward genetic and RNA interference screens to identify genes regulating vulval induction and morphogenesis. Our data indicate that the proper positioning of the vulva in the mid-body region requires the polarized secretion of the inductive EGF signal from the anchor cell (AC), in addition to the basolateral localization of the EGFR in the VPCs. A systematic screen identified the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) SRA-9 and SRH-27 as well as the neurpopetide-like protein NLP-26 as regulators of polarized EGF secretion. In parallel,we have characterized genes that control different aspects of vulval morphogenesis. In particular, the invading AC induces the lateral constriction of the invaginating 1° vuF cells during lumen morphogenesis via the TOCA proteins. Finally, we have studied the control of VPC proliferation by the lin-39 hox and the lin-31 forkhead transcription factors. We found that LIN-39 HOX determines the temporal competence of the vulval cells undergo proliferation by activating the transcription of several cell cycle regulator genes.Specific aims:The proposed research focuses on three specific aims that each address an essential aspects of vulval development:How is the polarized secretion of LIN-3 EGF by the AC controlled?Which molecular pathways does the invading AC activate in the 1° vulF cells to induce their lateral constriction?How do LIN-31 Forkhead and LIN-39 HOX regulate the onset and termination of vulval cell proliferation?Proposed experiments:For aim 1, we will study the genetic and biochemical interactions between LIN-3 and the the newly identified regulators of LIN-3 secretion, the GPCRs SRA-9, SRH-247 and the neuropeptide-like gene NLP-2. We will test if polarized LIN-3 secretion occurs in other tissues known to use this pathway. For aim 2, we will investigate genes identified in our vulval morphogenesis screen that are required for lumen formation. Specifically, we will investigate the role of the TOCA proteins in sensing the invading AC and identify their downstream targets that regulate actomyosin activity. For aim 3, we will characterize the LIN-31 targets that control VPC proliferation and test the role of LIN-39 in maintaining vulval cell proliferation using conditional gene inactivation. Our experimental design for each of the three specific aims takes full advantage of different CRISPR/CAS9 genome editing techniques.Significance and impact of our research:Our combined approach to investigate vulval fate specification, cell proliferation and morphogenesis has the goal to yield a complete understanding of this model for organogenesis. The principles we are discovering in this relatively simple model are likely to apply also to the development of more complex organs. The polarized secretion of an inductive signal is important to select single cells from an equivalence group and position the developing organ in the body. Vulval lumen formation serves as a good model to study how invasive cells change the morphology of their target tissue, for example during tumor cell intravasation. Finally, our work on cell cycle control by lin-39 and lin-31 will uncover the mechanisms that determine the temporal competence of cells to proliferate and generate the appropriate number of terminally differentiated cells.

289    Dr McIntyre Alan    EPF Lausanne    2016-01-01    2018-12-31    A Recombinant Inbred Line Aedes aegypti Reference Panel to study the genetic basis of variation in vectorial capacity    Dengue and chikungunya are mosquito-borne arboviruses that cause diseases considered “neglected” by the Neglected Tropical Diseases panel from the World Health Organization. They affect millions of people, mostly in the developing world, resulting in substantial hospitalization and often death. Dengue is the most prevalent and rapidly spreading one, with an estimated 390 million human infections worldwide per year (Bhatt et al., 2013). It represents not only a severe public health problem, but also an economic burden for governments and individuals, with costs around US$2,1 billion per year only in the Americas (Shepard et al., 2011). Since 2004, chikungunya re-emerged at an unprecedented global scale, leaving its endemic areas in Africa and Asia towards naive regions in the Americas and even in Europe. Due to the lack of vaccines, prevention of dengue and chikungunya is based mainly in the control of their insect vector, the mosquito Aedes aegypti.Over the last decades, studies on A. aegypti vectorial competence and its capacity for pathogen transmission have generated important knowledge on dengue epidemiology. However, vector competence is not necessarily the most influential parameter underlying epidemiology dynamics. As the arboviruses also affect mosquito fitness, the mechanisms influencing vector competence are more likely the consequence of other phenotype adaptation's such as olfaction and gustatory cues, circadian rhythms and host seeking behavior, mating, and insecticide resistance. Therefore, a deeper understanding of A. aegypti biology and the impact of arbovirus infection on the life-history traits of this insect should have important implications for predicting the evolution of mosquito-parasite relationships and their role in the emergence and maintenance of arboviruses.It has proven up to date extremely challenging to achieve effective and sustainable control of A. aegypti populations to hinder arbovirus outbreaks. Historically, insecticides have been used with this aim. Nowadays insecticides are adopted with caution as genetic variation in natural populations leads to strong resistance selection against the few compounds that are allowed. New control alternatives are currently under development, such as the release in nature of mosquitoes that are genetically modified or infected with the bacteria Wolbachia, which in both cases aims to make the mosquitoes pathogen-resistant. But besides the potential ecological consequences, these strategies don’t take into account the viral strain present at the locality of release, ignoring genome-by-genome (GxG) interactions between mosquito and its parasite, which has been shown to strongly influence transmission dynamics in several systems.To overcome these limitations, we propose here the generation and sequencing of a genetic reference panel for the mosquito A. aegypti for molecular and organismal genome-wide association studies. This panel will be an innovative genetics tool available as a resource to the mosquito scientific community, serving as a reference to the identification of genotype-phenotype relationships. This will complement classical efforts in the fight against the diseases transmitted by this vector, therefore contributing to a holistic understanding of the biology of A. aegypti as a whole. The integration of Rio de Janeiro´s host lab expertise in different A. aegpyti wild strains, the Swiss lab competence on genetic reference panels and systems genetics, the availability of a mosquito reference genome and the use of increasingly cheaper massively parallel sequencing technology, makes the sequencing of the planned 100 A. aegpyti lines, in our opinion, a feasible task from both an experimental and economical point of view.Specifically, we propose here (i) the generation of a panel of at least 100 recombinant inbred lines of A. aegypti, (ii) the detailed genomic characterization of this panel and (iii) the use of genome-wide association mapping techniques to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with different organismal trait phenotypes (e.g. vectorial capacity). We expect that this community resource will allow researchers to search for candidate genetic variants that are relevant to arbovirus transmission dynamics, as well as for other traits related to mosquito biology. This resource will not only be valuable for quantitative genetics studies, but also for deep understanding of the Brazilian A. aegypti demography, inference of selective sweeps, and field work (Evans et al., 2015).Considering the natural genetic variability of mosquito populations collected in Brazil, advanced inter-crosses are currently being performed using samples representing four distinct groups. A derived strain containing the genetic pool of those parental populations will be divided in 250 lines, which will be successively inbred until they reach isogenicity. After 20 inbreeding generations, assuming that some lines will not be homozygously viable, we expect to characterize the genome of at least 100 lines and describe genetic variants present in this panel. Intermediate milestones, i.e, the sequencing of the four parental lines and the partial sequencing of some lines obtained in intermediate generations of the inbreeding stage, will allow the anticipation of the variability pool expected in the full panel and the control for the isogenicity status.Finally, we will conduct phenotypic studies in each line to identify genetic determinants that may affect components related to vector capacity. Genome-wide association studies for overall vector competence and QTL mapping studies for molecular phenotypes will elucidate novel molecular mechanisms that are involved in the dynamics of disease transmission. The generation of A. aegypti recombinant inbred lines will thereby serve as permanent resource for studying various components of the molecular transmission route. Our proposed resource is complementary to the recent implementation of genetic tools in this species such as RNAi, transgenesis and CRISPR-mediated knockouts, and will provide the scientific community an additional powerful instrument in the study of this species. Moreover, we expect that our trait mapping studies will identify novel genetic markers that could be harvested in new strategies that may be effective against dengue and chikungunya.

290    Dr McIntyre Alan    Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research Massachusetts Institute of Technology    2015-04-01    2016-09-30    Plant triterpenoid metabolism and signaling: through the lens of cytochrome P450s    As sessile organisms, plants possess elaborate specialized metabolic systems that produce a panoply of secondary metabolites as a means to adapt to challenging environments. Triterpenoids form a large class of specialized plant metabolites. The functions of plant steroidal triterpenoids (phytosterols and brassinosteroids) are now well described. By contrast, the biological roles of non-steroidal triterpenoids such as ß-amyrin, lupeol and brassicales-specific thalianol and marneral are mostly unknown. Besides their possible involvement in plant defense, recent studies suggest that several groups of non-steroidal triterpenoids may also serve as signaling molecules modulating plant growth and development. However, how structurally diverse non-steroidal triterpenoids are biosynthesized and further exert hormonal functions in vivo remain a quandary. Here, I propose to interrogate this question by studying three brassicales-specific cytochrome P450 families, CYP702A, 705A and 708A, which are speculated to modify non-steroidal triterpene skeletons into signaling compounds. Until now, genetic analysis of these CYP families has been impeded by the redundant nature of these gene families as well as the prevalent clustering of genes belonging to the same CYP family at adjacent genomic loci. To circumvent these difficulties, I intend to generate multiple Arabidopsis thaliana mutant lines of each CYP family using two complementary approaches, artificial microRNA silencing and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology, both of which are capable of down-regulating multiple genes simultaneously. I will then characterize the metabolic phenotypes of these mutant lines using state-of-the-art metabolomics. The structure of the relevant triterpenoids identified through this approach will be further elucidated. The proposed research will yield fundamental knowledge on triterpenoid metabolism in plants, and will further generate tractable genetic systems to understand the signaling properties of specialized non-steroidal triterpenes in plants.

291    Dr McIntyre Alan    Research Institute for Molecular Pathology    2016-02-01    2017-07-31    Functional characterization of long non-coding RNAs in the nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans    Almost nothing is known about the functionality of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and no sufficient efforts have been made in the characterization of their mechanism(s) of action. lncRNAs have been implicated in different aspects of gene regulation, from post-transcriptional control to chromatin modification, and their abundance and stage-specificity hint for specific roles in development. Recently, in humans, some lncRNAs have been implicated in aberrant brain development and age-related mental illness, making them an interesting class of RNAs to study to identify new targets to cure such pathologies at a new level. The easily manipulating and fast growing nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been chosen as a model system to study lncRNAs in neuronal development and function. With genetic (creating new mutants with the CRISPR/Cas9 technique), biochemical (ribosome profiling on purified neurons and pull downs of protein partners with modified lncRNAs) and functional (phenotypic and behavioral assays) studies, I am willing to characterize the mechanisms of action of such a class of RNAs. Although the primary sequences of lncRNAs are not highly conserved between species, the hope is to be able to identify evolutionally conserved strategies and/or pathways lncRNAs act in and, therefore, alternative approaches to cure neuronal diseases.

292    Dr McIntyre Alan    University of Basel    2017-05-01    2021-04-30    Deciphering the role of lymphoid-tissue networks and innate lymphoid cells for adaptive immunity    Background: Different cells of the innate and adaptive immune system cooperate to achieve an equilibrium of immune responses that maintains tolerance to self-antigens (Ags), nutrients and commensal bacteria, but clears foreign Ags and eliminates tumor cells. T lymphocytes and their innate counterparts, the innate lymphoid cell (ILCs) are tightly regulated by a coordinate program of transcription factors. Moreover, tissue microenvironments contribute to the outcome of local immune responses such that immunopathology is avoided. Group 3 ILC3s are abundant in Ag entry sites like intestine, secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) and are also found in postnatally developing tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs). They act as first-line responders to tissue injury, infection and inflammation. Small intestinal (SI) ILC3s prevent T cell responses to commensal Ags, whereas splenic (SP) ILC3s promote T cell responses to foreign Ags emphasizing their tissue-specific properties. How SP and SI ILC subsets and T cells collaborate during inflammation and infection is not understood. A detailed analysis of SP and SI ILC subsets under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions will help to understand the mutual interaction of lymphoid tissues, ILC3s and T cells that are required for immune homeostasis in tissues. Here we propose a system-wide approach to investigate transcriptional landscapes of SP and SI-specific ILC3 subsets in mice under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions and in mice with disturbed T cell compartments. In particular, we seek to identify transcripts in ILC3s, which are tissue-specific or depend on interactions with CD4+ T cells. Moreover, we want to identify key pathways in ILC3s, which regulate their immune-regulatory function for CD4+ T cells. Finally, we want to elucidate how TLOs modulate adaptive immune responses. Working hypothesis: This research project is based on the hypothesis that the collaboration of ILC3 subsets with CD4+ T cells differentially regulates innate inflammation and adaptive immune responses in a tissue-dependent manner.Specific Aims: Here we propose a novel project aimed at (1) dissecting the molecular signatures of ILC3s, (2) characterizing the mutual interactions of ILC3s and CD4+ T cells and their impact for innate and adaptive immunity in vivo and (3) generating an inducible IL-7 tg mouse to test the effect of TLOs on ILC3s and adaptive immune cells.Experimental Design and Methods: Advances in single cell analysis, gene targeting and generation of inducible mouse models together with state of the art bioinformatics will be used to address the specific aims. We will map ILC3 signature in SP and SI of normal and CD4+ T cell deficient mice and in mouse model with acute intestinal or splenic inflammation. The function of tissue-specific ILC3 genes will be tested in loss of function models using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated deletion in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and by generating ROR?Cre-lox recombination mouse models. Using various Ags we will test the capacity of ILC3 subsets to regulate T cell responses in vivo and in vitro. Finally will study whether the induction of TLOs by ILC3s has an impact on adaptive immune cell homeostasis. Expected Value of the proposed project: Data obtained from this study will help to identify target genes and pathways that control the induction or suppression of T cell responses. These targets are laying the foundation for the development of new therapeutic strategies to prevent chronic inflammation and immune stimulation and to promote protective immune responses against pathogens as well as tolerance against commensal bacteria.

293    Dr McIntyre Alan    University of Geneva    2017-11-01    2020-10-31    Collinear regulation of HoxD genes during development and evolution    This grant application covers the continuation of our work on the mechanistic nature of collinear gene regulation at Hox loci. It is mostly concerned with the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying long-range and coordinated transcriptional control of clustered Hox genes. The ultimate aim of this research is to understand the origin, evolution and implementation of collinear Hox gene regulation in several developmental contexts such as the major axis, the appendicular axis and the external genitals. Several approaches are used relying on mammalian embryos and molecular genetics and generally based on the large amount of mutant stocks we have accumulated during the last rounds of SNF funding. This allelic series is now being complemented with CRISPR-cas9-based modifications in vivo. We would like to assess the respective weights of cluster internal versus external factors in these critical regulations by using range of deletions and inversions affecting the flanking gene deserts, as well as more surgical deletions of precise enhancer sequences present within the flanking TADs. In the case of the limbs, we want to directly visualize the implementation of this mechanism by 3D-DNA FISH. In addition, we will continue investigating the use of organoids (gastruloids) as a non-animal model system to try to study this molecular processes in more amenable conditions.

294    Dr McIntyre Alan    Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics    2014-06-01    2017-11-30    Bioinformatics and modeling of bacterial immune systems - understanding control of CRISPR/Cas    CRISPR/Cas (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/CRISPR associated sequences) is a recently discovered prokaryotic immune system. CRISPR array encodes for small interfering RNA molecules (called crRNAs), so that a match between crRNA and invading virus sequence provides immunity to infection. While there has been a significant progress in CRISPR/Cas research, it is still unclear how processes such as CRISPR transcript processing, prevention of autoimmunity, and the system induction upon virus infection are controlled. In particular, it is becoming increasingly clear that small RNAs that are encoded outside of CRISPR array have major regulatory roles in CRISPR/Cas, but a systematic identification and characterization of these CRISPR/Cas associated small RNAs has yet to be done. However, a major problem in comprehensive analysis of these small RNAs is insufficient accuracy with which transcription start sites (TSS) can be predicted. Another prominent problem for CRISPR/Cas systems is regulation of its induction, i.e. how a large number of crRNAs can be rapidly generated without leading to autoimmunity.Main goal of this proposal is to better understand control of CRISPR/Cas by small RNAs and during system induction; to achieve this goal, we will also extend our previous work on accurate alignments of bacterial promoter elements, and on biophysical modeling of transcription initiation by bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP), in order to significantly improve accuracy of TSS prediction. Specifically we will: i) Develop a novel - biophysically based - method for TSS detection in bacteria, which builds on our recent work on modeling how RNAP opens the two DNA strands and on accurately characterizing DNA sequences that interact with RNAP; the method will be based on explicitly estimating the rate of transcription initiation for any sequence of interest, ii) Systematically predict small RNAs that are related with CRISPR/Cas, analyze their conservation in bacterial genomes, and compare them with other elements of CRISPR/Cas systems, iii) Model regulation of CRISPR/Cas induction in E. coli, in order to understand how they achieve a rapid enough response to external signal. We expect that this research will significantly improve our understanding of CRISPR/Cas systems, and further improve bioinformatic methods which are necessary for analyzing bacterial genome sequences.

295    Dr McIntyre Alan    University of Basel    2017-05-01    2020-04-30    The multiverse of MR1-restricted T cells and of their stimulatory metabolite antigens    The multiverse of MR1-restricted T cells and of their stimulatory metabolite antigens1. Summary of the research planA central mechanism of immune response is antigen recognition. The dogma that only peptides stimulate T cells has become obsolete after the evidence that structurally different molecules, including lipids and small metabolites, are immunogenic for T cells. Ongoing studies are revealing the relevance of non-peptide-specific T cells in microbial and tumor immunity and in co-ordinating immune response.Non-peptidic antigen recognition by T cells is the subject of our scientific interest. Recently, we focused on T cells recognizing metabolite antigens presented by the MR1 restriction molecule. The immunological functions of this novel population of T cells are still poorly characterized and their role in diseases remains to be investigated. Unexpectedly, these studies are unravelling a new world of antigens consisting of small metabolites that may accumulate within bacterial cells, tumor cells and activated B cells. The coordinated regulation of cellular metabolism and its alteration in bacteria and host cells are novel perspectives for understanding how metabolite-specific T cells participate in host defences and immune homeostasis. We plan to address three aspects:1.The repertoire of metabolite antigens stimulating MR1-restricted T cells.2.The metabolome regulation and the mechanisms of metabolite-presentation by MR1.3.The role of MR1-restricted T cells in the immune response.These studies will take advantage of a combination of state-of-the-art methodologies: cellular techniques to isolate and characterize MR1-restricted T cells, single cell transcriptomics and multidimensional flow-cytometry to investigate the presence of distinct MR1-restricted T cell populations, knock-out cells by CRISPR/Cas9 technique to identify key genes involved in MR1 antigen-presentation, and biochemical tools (HPLC separation and mass spectrometry) to identify novel stimulatory metabolites. Finally, two novel models of TCR retrogenic mice will be generated to investigate the regulatory role of MR1-restricted T cells in antibody responses and in tumor immunosurveillance.Overall, these studies aim at understanding the physiological implications of metabolite antigen recognition by T lymphocytes. Targeting metabolite-specific responses may represent a so far unforeseen immune strategy for inducing more efficient responses to microbial and tumor antigens.

296    Dr McIntyre Alan    ETH Zurich    2015-04-01    2018-03-31    CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing in stem cell organoids to functionally characterize regulators of tissue homeostasis and tumor driver genes    In metazoans older differentiated and damaged cells are typically lost by apoptosis and replaced by the progeny of dividing somatic stem cells. Accurate regulation of somatic stem cell proliferation and differentiation is therefore essential for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Disruptions in these regulatory mechanisms may cause tissue dysfunction and the formation of neoplasia. Normally, such disorders are caused by spontaneous mutations in oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, which allow stem cells to expand beyond their niche and to proliferate and survive without the normally required signals. Accumulation of additional tumor driver mutations can further transforms neoplasia into a malignant carcinoma. With the proposed project we aim to identify and characterize novel regulators of somatic stem cell proliferation and differentiation, which when mutated drive tumor formation and progression. As a model we will focus on intestinal stem cells, which when provided with the right niche factors can be grown in vitro in organoid cultures. Importantly in this system they retain their natural characteristics and form a polarized epithelium that contains all specialized cell types of the intestine. We hypothesize that genes which are (a) specifically expressed in somatic stem cells and (b) mutated at a statistically significant rate in cancer (tumor drivers) with high probability regulate stem cell/tissue homeostasis, and that they can be functionally identify by applying CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to organoids. We will therefore generate targeted libraries, and use them in FACS assays that quantify stem cell proliferation and cell-type proportions, and in survival assays in which normally essential niche signals such as Wnt and EGF will be blocked and downstream activating mutations will be identified. We will unravel the molecular functions of the identified genes using quantitative imaging and functional genomics approaches in mouse and human organoid systems, and complement the findings by in vivo mouse studies. Discovering novel mechanisms that drive neoplastic and cancerous transformations in stem cells will not only broaden our understanding of tissue homeostasis, but also allow to us develop new strategies for targeted cancer therapies.

297    Dr McIntyre Alan    University of Lausanne    2016-10-01    2019-09-30    Dendritic cell lines, new tools for research in immune response and tolerance    Dendritic cells (DCs) are hematopoietic cells that regulate the decision between immune response and immune tolerance. Since they are difficult to obtain in nonactivated state, show limited survival in culture and are difficult to isolate in sufficient numbers, we generated during the last granting period a panel of new CD8 murine tumor (MuTu) DC lines in a CD11c promoter driven large T transgenic mouse system. These cells share most functions and gene expression patterns with freshly derived wild type CD8+ DC. The current grant is divided into 2 major subprojects with 5 aims and 5 working hypotheses.1)DC lines. Aim 1: Derivation and characterization of new mouse CD11b DC lines. We have recently derived first CD11b DC lines after breeding the large T transgene into the BatF3 KO background and propose a detailed characterization of these new DC lines. We also will generate a series of CRISPR/Cas9 KO and knockin (KIN) DC lines, required to perform some of the proposed experiments. Working hypotheses 1a: These new cell lines are comparable to freshly isolated CD11b DCs and 1b: the CRISPR/Cas9 technology allows deriving the required cell lines. Based on preliminary results this part should be easily achieved. 2)Immune response and tolerance. . Aims 2: Having described during the last granting period two markers (CCR7 and IL12p40) that distinguish DCs activated with single signals (CpG, polyIC (pIC) or IFN-?), 2 signals (synergy, CpG+pIC) or 3 signals (supersynergy, CpG+pIC+IFN?) ????????????????? sh and CRISPR/Cas9 library screens to identify key pathways for synergy and ??p?????????. Working hypothesis 2: Using sh and CRISPR/Cas9 library screens we can identify key players in synergy and supersynergy. . Aim 3: Vaccination with tolerogenic DCs allows treatment of autoimmunity and delays transplant rejection. We will test combinations of tolerogenic DCs. Working hypothesis 3: We can change established TH profiles by applying single or combined tolerogenic signals to memory and effector T cells and we can use these DCs to allow transplant acceptance with transient immune suppression. .Aims 4: Since reducing gene expression of single transcription factors can alter whole programs of cytokine secretion in DCs we want to test other candidates and analyze the consequences of these altered programs for autoimmunity, infection, and immune response. Working hypothesis 4: Removal of single transcription factors allows to completely changing the cytokine profiles of activated DCs and hence results in altered TH differentiation patterns in vivo and in vitro. .Aims 5: Since CD11b reduces the available IL-6 and hence prevents exaggerated TH17 responses and its absence renders mice susceptible to autoimmunity we want to find the molecular and biological reasons for this effect. Working hypothesis 5: Tolerogenic properties of the integrin CD11b are due to CD11b signal mediated inflammatory or anti-inflammatory antigen presenting cell differentiation. We postulate that inflammatory and anti-inflammatory ligands for CD11b exist.    Swiss National Science Foundation    Project funding (Div. I-III)    525000.0CHF
298    Dr McIntyre Alan    University of Berne    2016-06-01    2019-05-31    Analyzing and modulating the epigenetic landscape of CDX2 as well as studying its function in colorectal cancer pathology    The homeobox caudal-type 2 gene CDX2 is required for differentiation, proliferation and maintenance of an intestinal cell phenotype. Our group has shown that CDX2 protein is absent or markedly reduced in up to 20% of colorectal cancers, which correlates with de-differentiation, metastatic spread and unfavorable patient outcome. Our preliminary data using a panel of colorectal cancer cell lines confirms that promoter hypermethylation is a likely cause of CDX2 expression loss, since CDX2 expression can be recovered upon treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi). Here, we aim to show that epigenetic modifications leading to CDX2 loss are clinically and functionally relevant and that these effects can be reversed by epigenetic therapies. Since these therapies have ‘global’ effects on demethylation, we aim to overcome the methylation blockade of CDX2, by establishing a state-of the-art method for specific targeting of the CDX2 promoter for re-activation. To achieve these aims, we will first determine whether CDX2 promoter hypermethylation causes CDX2 protein loss in human colorectal cancers and we will assess the relationship of CDX2 with the general methylator phenotype. Second, we take advantage of a fully-characterized cohort of colorectal cancer patients (n=750) to determine the potential prognostic and predictive relevance of CDX2 hypermethylation and protein loss. Third, we will identify novel transcriptional regulators of CDX2 based on transcription binding site prediction (e.g. GATA family members and p300) by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and validate results using other promoter assays. The function of these transcription factors in colorectal cancer cell lines after knock-down will be assessed. Our findings will be validated using fresh frozen material from our high-quality biobank. Fourth, we will determine the effects of DNMTis and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) on methylated and unmethylated cell lines in vitro and CDX2 expression. Chromatin structure will be investigated by analysing open and repressed histone marks and their effect on CDX2 restoration. To re-activate silenced CDX2 promoters we propose to use CRISPR technology to target either a transcriptional activation domain or the catalytic domain of the demethylating TET2 protein to the human CDX2 promoter. Small guide (sg) RNAs will be designed and tested to target nuclease inactive Cas9 fused to either VPS64, a transcriptional activator, or to the catalytic domain of TET2, a demethylating enzyme to the CDX2 promoter region. To further increase the chance of successful re-activation of the CDX2 promoter, we take advantage of an amplifier system based on a polypeptide scaffold (Sun Tag) fused to the inactive Cas9 protein. The Sun Tag will be able to recruit multiple VPS64 or TET2 proteins, fused to single chain variable fragment specific for the Sun polypeptide, to the CDX2 promoter region. We will establish CDX2 knockdown colon cancer cell lines and compare expression of CDX2 in methylated, unmethylated and genomically modified cell lines, then perform functional assays to determine effects on proliferation, migration and invasion. This will allow us to determine whether CDX2 expression and its function can be reversed upon modification. This proposal uses the latest genome editing technologies to uncover new aspects of CDX2 in colorectal cancers. Not only will the clinical and biological relevance of this gene be detailed, but new regulatory aspects of CDX2 will be highlighted. Additionally, successful targeted re-activation of an already-methylated promoter, as we are proposing to do in the project, may be further generalized to other important tumor suppressor genes and could have significant therapeutic potential.

299    Dr McIntyre Alan    Beckman Research Institute Department of Systems Biology City of Hope NCI Comprehensive Cancer Center    2018-04-01    2019-09-30    Pharmacological targeting of autoimmunity checkpoints (AIC) in B-cell malignancies    Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy in children and is also frequent in adults. Despite a generally favorable prognosis, the relapse rates of around 20% remain a major clinical challenge and ALL still represents one of the leading causes of disease mortality in childhood. Identifying novel treatment approaches aimed at preventing or circumventing drug resistance is therefore of great importance. B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling is critical during the development and maturation of B lymphocytes, as it provides survival and proliferation signals during the process of positive selection. However, hyperactivation of BCR signaling by a self-recognizing receptor leads to the elimination of autoreactive B lymphocytes during the process known as negative selection or autoimmunity checkpoint (AIC). The pro-survival BCR pathway is often mimicked by oncogenic drivers of B-cell malignancies, such as the oncogenic fusion protein BCR-ALB1, and current treatment strategies have focused on the inhibition of such signaling using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). However, the responses to TKI are usually short and resistant clones can emerge rapidly. Previous work from Prof. Dr. Müschen’s group has shown that B-cell malignancies are also sensitive to the activation of AIC and that the process of negative selection can be exploited to eradicate TKI-resistant B-ALL. Here we propose to investigate the pre-clinical potential of AIC activation as a novel strategy for the treatment of drug-resistant B-cell malignancies, based on the following aims:a.Evaluate and prioritize AIC agonistsHyperactivation of BCR signaling can be achieved through the inhibition of various negative regulators. We will establish a pre-clinical in vitro drug testing platform to compare and prioritize the different classes of inhibitors, as well as to evaluate synergistic combinations. The candidate drugs will be validated in vivo in a xenograft mouse model.b.Investigate the mechanisms of AIC-induced cell deathThe mechanisms leading to cell death during negative selection are not yet fully understood. We will investigate which cell death pathways are required for the AIC using specific inhibitors and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockouts for different cell death pathways, including necroptosis and energy crisis. Understanding the cell death mechanism will likely provide insight for further drug combinations.c.Integrate AIC activation into current treatment strategiesThe hyperactivation of multiple kinases via prolonged AIC activation raises safety concerns. We will explore dosing schedules based on a sequential treatment of TKI and a short pulse of AIC activation and investigate its potential to eliminate drug-resistant clones in xenografts in vivo.

300    Braun Simon    School of Medicine / HHMI Stanford University    2016-02-01    2017-07-31    Exploring the function of transcriptional enhancers by rapid and reversible repression    Advances in sequencing technologies have shed new light on the regulatory sequences within mammalian genomes that are essential for establishing gene expression networks. Certain non-coding regulatory sequences, called enhancers, bind to gene promoters and act as molecular switches to regulate gene expression during development. The recent explosion in genomics data has revealed epigenetic features that correlate with the active state of enhancers; however, little is known about the molecular events that are required to establish enhancer activity, as it has proven difficult to manipulate the ‘on’ and ‘off’ states of these sequences in vivo. To address this issue, we propose to develop a novel technology that allows for rapid and reversible silencing of transcriptional enhancers in living cells. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and small molecule chemical inducers of proximity, we will be able to modify the epigenetic state of a given enhancer, enabling us to switch target gene expression on and off. Further, because this system allows precise temporal control we will be able to define and model the biochemical sequence of events that lead to both the establishment and dissolution of enhancer-promoter choices. With the insights gained from these mechanistic studies, we can apply these observations to many pressing biological questions. We aim to repress neuronal enhancers during neural stem cell differentiation to determine their functional contribution to neural cell identity, as well as test the therapeutic potential of this approach by silencing oncogenic enhancers to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells.

301    Dr Nelson Andrew    University of Warwick    2019-07-01    2022-06-30    Regulation of trophoblast differentiation by BAF complex chromatin remodelling factors    Advances in sequencing technologies have shed new light on the regulatory sequences within mammalian genomes that are essential for establishing gene expression networks. Certain non-coding regulatory sequences, called enhancers, bind to gene promoters and act as molecular switches to regulate gene expression during development. The recent explosion in genomics data has revealed epigenetic features that correlate with the active state of enhancers; however, little is known about the molecular events that are required to establish enhancer activity, as it has proven difficult to manipulate the ‘on’ and ‘off’ states of these sequences in vivo. To address this issue, we propose to develop a novel technology that allows for rapid and reversible silencing of transcriptional enhancers in living cells. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and small molecule chemical inducers of proximity, we will be able to modify the epigenetic state of a given enhancer, enabling us to switch target gene expression on and off. Further, because this system allows precise temporal control we will be able to define and model the biochemical sequence of events that lead to both the establishment and dissolution of enhancer-promoter choices.

302    Dr Nelson Andrew    Queensland Brain Institute The University of Queensland    2017-04-01    2018-09-30    Dissecting the dendritic function of Tau protein and the Src kinase FYN, two proteins implicated in Alzheimer’s disease    BACKGROUND: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder worldwide, affecting 2% of the population in industrialized countries. The disease is marked by the presence of extracellular plaques - composed of aggregated amyloid-ß peptide (Aß) - and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) - consisting of aggregates of abnormally hyperphosphorylated Tau protein. Recent studies showed that Aß and abnormal Tau protein may interact and have synergistic toxic effects, leading to neuronal death in AD, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Although Tau was primarily described as an axonal protein stabilizing microtubule function and assembly, new findings obtained in the laboratory of Professor Jürgen Götz at the University of Queensland (Australia) identified a dendritic function of this protein that seems to be crucial in mediating Aß toxicity at the postsynaptic compartment. Indeed, Tau is required for the targeting of FYN, a Src kinase widely expressed in the hippocampus, to dendritic spines. FYN phosphorylates the GluN2B subunit of the NMDA receptor, which is essential for recruiting the postsynaptic density (95kD) protein (PSD95). This enhances the stability of the receptor complex at the synaptic membrane, which boosts the excitotoxic signaling induced by the presence of Aß. Interestingly, in absence of Tau, the targeting/clustering of FYN is massively reduced in the dendritic spines and, vice versa, when tau is pseudo-phosphorylated at distinct phosphorylation sites (AT180 - 12E8 - PHF1 - S396/S404), targeting of Tau and FYN to spines is markedly increased. Together, this identifies a cross-talk between the two molecules which we intend to further dissect in the present proposal.HYPOTHESIS: Thus, based on the previous and preliminary data obtained in the laboratory of Prof. Götz, the overarching hypothesis of the project is that the subcellular localization, trafficking and clustering of FYN and Tau are tightly regulated in a physiological and pathological context (AD).AIMS: The specific aims of the present study are to prove our hypothesis and to enhance our understanding of the endogenous regulation of Tau and FYN trafficking to the dendritic spine. For this approach, a combination of technics (biochemical, pharmacological as well as super-resolution microscopy) established in the Götz laboratory, will be used to identify the mechanisms underlying the targeting of Tau and FYN at the spine, under physiological and pathological (AD) conditions. Especially, we will use novel gene-edited mouse strains created in the Götz laboratory with the TALEN / CRISPR technology, introducing a photo-convertible mEOS2 tag in-frame into the carboxy-terminus of either the Tau-encoding gene or the FYN-encoding gene. The fluorescence emitted by Tau-mEOS2 and FYN-mEOS2 will be analyzed using super resolution microscopy technics, including the single particle tracking photo-activated localization microscopy (sptPALM).Using these tools, we would like to pursue two main objectives as part of this program:Specific Aim 1: To determine the mobility of FYN and Tau in the somato-dendritic domain and spines: i) under physiological conditions; ii) after neuronal activation and; iii) in the presence of Aß.Specific Aim 2: To determine whether Tau controls FYN clustering (i.e. the formation of nanoclusters).IMPACT: The current approach opens the opportunity to dissect a novel fundamental mechanism and identifies how the two key molecules in AD, Aß and Tau, interact via FYN to exert their toxic effects. It uses state-of-the-art technology and has ramifications for additional neurodegenerative diseases with protein aggregation, as well as for the role Tau and FYN have in a physiological context and the identification of new therapeutic targets for the treatment of AD.

303    Dr Nelson Andrew    University of Fribourg    2015-10-01    2018-09-30    Mechanisms of organ regeneration in zebrafish    Human regenerative capacity is commonly inadequate after injury. By contrast, some lower vertebrates, such as zebrafish, can perfectly reconstruct their damaged organs, such as appendages, heart, retina and spinal cord. Little is known about biological factors that permit or suppress the natural ability of organ regeneration. Our goal is to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms that generate new cells for fin and heart regeneration in zebrafish. We will focus on dedifferentiation processes that transform mature cells at the site of injury into a progenitor cell pool, called the blastema. An understanding of blastema formation and regulation both in the fin and heart will elucidate common principles of the regenerative machinery. On the other hand, we will investigate the factors stimulating cardiac cell proliferation and transient scar deposition after heart infarction. This undertaking will demand the use of existing methods, as well as developing novel research tools in adult zebrafish, such as the inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system technology. A conceptual and molecular deciphering of mechanisms of natural regeneration in lower vertebrates will help to build a foundation for regenerative medicine.

304    Dr Nelson Andrew    University of Lausanne    2016-02-01    2019-01-31    ALK in the control of neural crest differentiation and neuroblastic tumor development    ALK IN THE CONTROL OF NEURAL CREST DIFFERENTIATION AND NEUROBLASTIC TUMOR DEVELOPMENT Neuroblastoma (NB) is a classical pediatric cancer originating from aberrant differentiation of neural crest (NC)-derived sympathoadrenal progenitors. The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene is a major oncogene in NB, and ALK activating mutations or wild-type (wt) expression are associated with poor clinical outcome. The implication of ALK-wt, and the ALK activating mutations, ALK-F1174L, and ALK-R1275Q, in NC progenitor fate and neuroblastomagenesis was previously investigated using immortalized murine neural crest progenitor cells (NCPC), MONC-1 and JoMa-1. In vivo studies by orthotopic (adrenal gland) implantations reveled that MONC-1 cells could generate various tumor types, such as NB, osteo/chondrosarcoma, and undifferentiated tumors. In contrast, MONC-1 cells expressing ALK-F1174L only produced highly aggressive undifferentiated NC cell-derived tumors, similarly to JoMa1 cells overexpressing ALK-wt, or activating ALK mutants. JoMa1-ALK-derived tumors expressed high levels of various stem cells (SC) and NC stem cell (NCSC) associated markers, confirming their stem-like and phenotypes, and suggesting an ALK-mediated impairment of NCPC differentiation potential in vivo.The specific objectives of the present project are to investigate the functional role of ALK and its downstream pathways in the control of NCPC differentiation potential and fate, as well as to elucidate the involvement of activated ALK in the maturation of the sympathoadrenal lineage and in NB differentiation. Using ALK-transduced NCPC cell lines described above in combination with specific ALK and ALK signaling pathways inhibitors, we will investigate the influence of activated ALK signaling on NCPC differentiation capacity and fate in vitro. To increase our knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms and transcriptional controllers involved in ALK-mediated blockage of NCPC differentiation in vivo, we plan to investigate the global epigenetic patterns and the expression profiles associated to NB orthotopic tumors-derived from MONC1 cells as compared to undifferentiated tumors-derived from MONC-1-ALK-F cells. The role of putative ALK target genes, Myc and Twist1/2, or of newly identified key transcriptional regulators in the control of NCPC differentiation will be explored by means of specific inhibitors and/or silencing strategies through CRISPR/Cas9. In addition, a special focus will be dedicated to the involvement of ALK deregulated activation in the differentiation and maturation of normal sympathetic neurons and adrenal chromaffin cells, using ALK-mutants knock-in mice, as well as in NB cell differentiation potential using ALK overexpressing NB cell lines. Moreover, clinical NB samples will be examined to identify a possible correlation between ALK expression level and/or localization, and neublastic cell differentiation status within individual tumors.This project will be performed within an established collaborative international team of experts in NC development (Prof. L. Sommer and Dr O. Shakhova), in the molecular genetics of NB (Drs I. Janoueix-Lerosey and G. Schleiermacher), in NB orthotopic modeling (Dr J.-M. Joseph), in NB histopathology (Dr M. Peuchmaur), and in epigenetic regulation of solid tumors (Dr N. Riggi). This study should provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms responsible for dysfunctional NC cell maturation responsible for NB development, and may contribute to the identification of new therapeutic options.

305    Dr Nelson Andrew    University of Zurich    2015-06-01    2018-05-31    Role of Scavenger Receptor BI and Endothelial Lipase in the Transendothelial Transport of High Density Lipoproteins    Background: High density lipoproteins (HDL) and their main protein constituent and precursor, apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), exert several atheroprotective actions within the vascular wall, notably the removal of cholesterol from macrophage foam cells for reverse transport to the liver. However, it is little understood how HDL and apoA-I pass the endothelial barriers to reach and leave the arterial intima with the lipid laden macrophages. We have previously found that aortic endothelial cells bind, internalize and resecrete apoA-I and HDL by processes that are modulated by the ATP binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1, respectively, as well as the scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI), endothelial lipase (EL), and the ectopic F0F1-ATPase/P2Y12 axis. We have not yet unravelled the mechanisms by which these proteins contribute to endothelial transcytosis of HDL. For this proposal we will focus on the role of SR-BI and EL.Working hypothesis: SR-BI and EL are HDL binding proteins that mediate the internalization of HDL either directly as an endocytic receptor (notably the SR-BII splice variant of SCARB1) or indirectly by transducing signals to an endocytic machinery (SR-BI via its PDZ or cholesterol sensing domains) or generating signaling molecules (EL by generating lysophosphatidylcholines or exposing S1P). Specific aims: In two subprojects we want to answer the following two questions: 1. How do SR-BI and EL regulate the internalization and trafficking of HDL through endothelial cells? 2. Do EL and SR-BI modulate transendothelial transport of HDL in vivo? Experimental design: For amswering the first question we will generate human aortic and lymphatic endothelial cell lines (HAEC and HLEC) with knock-outs of the SCARB1 and LIPG genes using the CRISPR/Cas system. The SCARB1 ko cell line will be knocked-in with either of the two isoforms SR-BI or SR-BII or with two SR-BI mutants which lack the signaling PDZ domain or the cholesterol sensing activity. The LIPG1 ko cells will be knocked-in with either wild type EL or an enzymatically inactive EL mutant. After confirming the endothelial phenotype the individual cell lines as well as the effective knock-outs and knock-ins, the cells will be analyzed for their function to bind, internalize and transport HDL per se and after complementation with signaling molecules (EL knock-out and knock-in cell lines). These biochemical experiments will be complemented by fluorescence microscopy studies to unravel any erroneous trafficking of HDL. The cells will also be characterized for other responses to HDL, notably in nitric oxide production, VCAM-1 expression, apoptosis, endothelial repair, and phosphorylation of signaling molecules. The second question will be approached by comparing the kinetics of radiocatively labeled HDL and control proteins in SCARB1 ko mice, LIPG ko mice and wild type mice. We will inject radioiodinated HDL, albumin or LDL into the tail vein to monitor its appearance in the arterial wall and peritoneal cave as well as into the peritoneal cave or foot pads to monitor its appearance in plasma. We will also use two photon live microscopy to study the kinetics by which fluorescence labeled HDL and control proteins injected intravenously and subcutaneously appear in the interstial space and microvessels of the skin, respectively. Expected value: Our project will answer a key question on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, namely how HDL particles enter and leave the vascular wall. This process is a pre-requisite for the mediation of anti-atherogenic functions of HDL and therefore a potential target for anti-atherosclerotic drug therapy.

306    Dr Nelson Andrew    ETH Zurich    2018-02-01    2021-01-31    Non-transgenic Genome Editing in Apple    Apple is the most prominent freshly consumed fruit in Switzerland and, after banana, the second most important fruit worldwide. Most of the apple cultivars produced today are susceptible to devastating diseases such as apple scab and fire blight. Therefore, the production of fruits attaining commercial quality requires excessive pesticide input. Breeding for resistant cultivars is the most economically and environmentally sustainable approach to reduce the chemical footprint of apple production. However, the selection of novel cultivars through classical apple breeding is a long process, hampered by the long juvenility phase and self-incompatibility of this species. Methods to obtain novel traits and improve disease resistance without undergoing several long-lasting breeding cycles are therefore of great interest.Genetic engineering has been proposed as an effective way to improve apple cultivars but the resulting genetically modified organisms currently lack public acceptance. Here, we propose to implement a non-transgenic system to obtain novel traits in apple, using the most prominent genome editing tool CRISPR/Cas9. This will be achieved by transfection of apple protoplasts with preassembled Cas9/gRNA ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) which avoids the need of integration of a Cas9 expressing transgene in the target plant. Specifically, we will establish the plant material and protocols for protoplasts production in the first two tasks. Task three aims at the establishment of an effective apple protoplasts regeneration protocol. In task four, protoplasts transfection with preassembled RNPs will be optimized using a widely applied selectable marker system (GFP; green fluorescent protein / BFP; blue fluorescent protein-conversion). These optimized protocols will be used in task five to generate the first mildew-resistant apple cultivar by an MdMLO19 knockout. In the sixth (high risk - high impact) task, the established genome editing system will be tested for its feasibility to replace large DNA sequences by homology-directed double strands breaks repair.This project will develop a transformation-free genome editing system in apple and generate improved germplasm in one of the most important fruits worldwide. On the long run, the methods and protocols established here will enable allele replacement strategies at known disease resistance genes to significantly reduce pesticide input in apple production.

The ability of the RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 to generate double strand breaks in invading DNA has been exploited for genome engineering, resulting as a transformative technology in life sciences. In spite of its impact, the structural and mechanistic details underlying the CRISPR-Cas9 function are unclear and call for a comprehensive knowledge. The goal of this research project is to clarify the molecular bases that enable Cas9 to exert its function via computational methods integrated with experiments. State-of-the-art computational methods - electron microscopy refinement, enhanced sampling molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations - will be flanked by mutagenesis, kinetic and single molecule experiments, and by X-ray crystallography. This project will rely on the long-standing experience in computational biophysics of Prof. McCammon and on the unique capability of the University of California San Diego. It will be supported by the experimental work of Prof. Jinek at the University of Zurich. We will focus on the three main open questions of CRISPR-Cas9 biology: (1) conformational activation of Cas9 by guide RNA binding, (2) molecular mechanism of DNA recognition and (3) catalytic mechanism of double strand DNA cleavage. Answering these questions is paramount for improved understanding of the molecular bases underlying Cas9 function. The ambition embodied in this proposal is directly related to its main outcomes. It aims at providing knowledge that will address the lack of mechanistic information about CRISPR-Cas9 biology and will serve as a basis for the rational design of new Cas9-based genome-engineering applications, with the potential of impacting basic and applied science.

These regulations often rely upon large genomic landscapes bearing several cis-regulatory sequences. In recent years, it has been shown that the 3-dimensional (3D) folding of these genomic landscapes allows the establishment of functional contacts between enhancers and promoters. Yet, little is known about the dynamics, specificity and factors controlling these enhancer-promoter interactions. First, to address these questions, we are characterizing 470 limb-associated regulatory landscapes and their 3D dynamics using Capture-C. Moreover, using CRISPR/Cas genetic engineering, we are challenging the importance of a tissue-specific transcription factor, namely Pitx1, on the 3D folding of these regulatory landscapes. In the second part of our proposal, we aim to investigate the establishment of complex genetic regulation at two prototypical limb loci, i.e. Pitx1 and Tbx5. For this purpose we functionally dissect, using an adapted CRISPR/Cas protocol, the regulatory landscape of both loci. Using these approaches, we expect to gain significant insights into complex genetic regulation and genomic 3D folding.    Swiss National Science Foundation    Advanced Postdoc.Mobility    445698.0CHF

EVs serve as transport vesicles for the transfer of molecules between cells. Scientists are attempting to seize this property and employ it for the delivery of therapeutic molecules. At the same time, breakthrough inventions in the field of gene-editing (CRISPR Cas9), are expected to radically change biological research and consequently gene therapy approaches. This project proposal explores the potential of employing EVs as vectors for gene therapy, for the treatment of heart failure. Techniques for EV isolation from human primary and embryonic stem cells will be explored, to assess the efficacy of the production yield. Raman spectroscopy will be used to understand the interaction of EVs with target cells. Loading of EVs with plasmid DNA will be performed using transfection and active loading approaches.

310    Dr Nelson Andrew    Department of Pediatrics University of California    2017-08-01    2019-01-31    Identification and validation of novel therapeutic targets for treatment of KRAS-dependent cancers    Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The most prevalent type of lung cancer is Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). A significant number of NSCLC cases are driven by activating mutations in Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS). However, the efforts to target KRAS directly have thus far proven unsuccessful and tumors harboring mutations in this gene remain the most difficult to treat, highlighting the need for alternative approaches. One promising avenue to treat these cancers is to exploit the concept of synthetic lethality. The aim of this project is to identify novel druggable KRAS synthetic lethal interactions. To achieve this goal we will perform genetic screens using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and the Cas9 nuclease (CRISPR/Cas9) system in KRAS-dependent lung cancer cell lines. We will also screen for combinations of KRAS interacting genes with already existing cancer drug targets. Finally, we will validate the identified genes and drug targets in vitro and in vivo, using human lung cancer cell lines, mouse models of lung cancer and patient-derived xenografts (PDX). This strategy should shorten the path towards the development of drugs for NSCLC and other KRAS-dependent cancers.    Swiss National Science Foundation    Advanced Postdoc.Mobility    445698.0CHF

The goal of this project is to identify and validate novel druggable targets for the therapy of KRAS-dependent non-small cell lung cancer cancer (NSCLC). To achieve this goal we will perform genetic screens using an innovative version of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in KRAS-dependent lung cancer cell lines. We will also validate the identified genes and drug targets in vivo, using mouse models of KRAS cancers and patient derived xenografts. This should lead to the development of a novel therapeutic strategy to treat KRAS-driven cancers.    Swiss National Science Foundation    Early Postdoc.Mobility    445698.0CHF
312    Dr Nelson Andrew    University of Zurich    2017-01-01    2019-12-31    Pathogenesis of Ewing Sarcoma    Although optimization of classical treatment regimens led to advances in survival of cancer patients, this approach now reached a plateau and there is no significant progress for patients presenting with metastasis since years. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify and develop further alternative targeted treatment strategies to improve therapy as well as minimize treatment related side effects. As about one third of the known cellular oncogenes are transcription factors (TFs), these represent highly interesting targets for potential therapeutic interventions, however remain challenging to directly inhibit by small molecules. In our experiments, we use the pediatric tumor Ewing sarcoma (ES) as a model system. This sarcoma is characterized by expression of the tumor-specific chimaeric TF EWS/FLI1 in the majority of cases. Survival of ES cells is dependent on continuous expression of the fusion protein in vitro as well as in vivo. Therefore, this TF represents an ideal and attractive therapeutic target and consequently we hypothesize here that targeting of EWS/FLI1 needs a deeper understanding of the biology of this fusion protein and its downstream targets. We propose on the one hand to identify and rank the physiological importance of activated downstream targets directly in vivo and on the other to characterize the fusion protein on the biochemical level to identify additional mechanisms for therapeutic intervention and tackle some of the urgent open questions in the field. Specifically, we will address the following research aims:1. To characterize the biochemistry of the fusion protein. Much attention has been devoted to study transcriptional mechanisms and target genes. In contrast, not much is known about specific post-translational mechanisms regulating the activity of the fusion protein. After having identified the majority of post-translational modifications of EWS/FLI1, we will study the physiological role of these modifications and identify upstream enzymes. Based on our previous studies, we will further characterize the regulatory mechanisms responsible for fusion protein turnover.2. To identify oncogenic key factors (drivers) from EWS/FLI1 activated target genes. Most of the studies available today characterize the function of individual target genes. However, it is not likely that all EWS/FLI1 activated genes act as oncogenic drivers in vivo. Hence, we propose to screen for crucial oncogenic drivers directly in vivo using an inducible shRNA library to identify and rank the most important therapeutic targets, also in the context of synthetic lethality with standard treatment. 3. To characterize early tumorigenic events by developing a novel ES tumor model based on reprogramming of engineered fibroblast. Because of lack of a suitable tumor model, early events leading to ES cannot be studied. We hypothesize that reprogramming of human fibroblasts to iPS cells and subsequent teratoma formation offers such a model system. We will model the EWS/FLI1 translocation in human fibroblasts using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique and subsequently reprogram these cells with the known Yamanaka factors. Pediatric sarcomas represent rare tumor types with still unacceptable low cure rates. Novel data characterizing the genomic landscape of ES tumors revealed that they show few recurrent additional genetic alterations apart from the fusion protein. Therefore, we focus our efforts on the biology of the fusion protein itself or important downstream target genes that represent actionable targets. The proposed experiments are expected to shed novel light on the biology of Ewing sarcoma, the regulation of EWS/FLI1 activity and thereby facilitate the development of urgently needed novel therapeutic strategies.

313    Dr Nelson Andrew    Department of Psychiatry Douglas McGill University    2014-10-01    2016-03-31    Functional, molecular and behavioural study of sleep disturbance in neuropathic rodent    BACKGROUNDChronic pain affects approximately one fifth of the adult world population and these people endure debilitating conditions of living. One type of chronic pain, neuropathic pain, is expected to affect more than 75 million of people worldwide. Neuropathic pain (NP) as defined by the IASP is a “Pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system”. This clinical syndrome may appear in the context of many different alterations of the peripheral and central nervous system; from radiculopathy induced by disk hernia, traumatic or compressive (tumors) nerve injuries, toxic, metabolic or infectious conditions (chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, AIDS-related pain, and so on) to multiple sclerosis, stroke or Parkinson disease. Neuropathic pain is associated with hyperexcitability of the central and the peripheral nervous systems, resulting in ongoing pain, allodynia (innocuous stimuli that become painful), hyperalgesia (exaggerated and prolonged pain response in response to noxious stimuli) and negative symptoms such as hypoalgesia. Increased neuronal activity can explain both spontaneous and exaggerated stimulus-evoked pain. In the nervous system, the excitability is mainly carried by voltage-gated sodium channels (Navs) that are responsible for the upstroke of action potentials. Navs are heteromeric glycosylated protein composed of a large pore-forming a-subunit and small ß-auxiliary subunits. Nine genes encode for distinct channel isoforms (Nav1.1 to Nav1.9) and all, except Nav1.4 and Nav1.5, are expressed in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) nociceptive neurons. In these neurons, Nav1.7 has been found to be the most expressed TTX-sensitive isoform compared to Nav1.1, Nav1.2, Nav1.3 and Nav1.6, and is coexpressed with the two TTX resistant isoforms, Nav1.8 and Nav1.9.In neuropathic pain, accumulation of Nav1.7, Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 was reported in the primary afference. In addition to this acquired pain syndrome, the contribution of Nav1.7 in inherited pain disorders has been recurrently reported. Congenital insensitivity to pain due to loss-of-function of the channel were first described in 2006 and since then other mutations have been reported. On the other side of the spectrum, multiple gain-of-functions mutations were shown to be associated with two exaggerated pain sensitivity pathologies, namely inherited erythromyelagia (IEM) and paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (PEPD). More recently, studies also highlighted a role for Nav1.7 in idiopathic small-fiber neuropathy (I-SFN); nearly 30% of patients suffering from this pathology presented a gain-of function mutation in Nav1.7. Small fiber peripheral neuropathy is a type of peripheral neuropathy that occurs from damage to C-fibers and A-d fibers that are the small unmyelinated and thinly myelinated peripheral nerve fibers belonging to nociceptive neurons. Since then, similar gain-of-function mutations in Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 have also been reported. I-SFN is not only accompanied with neuronal hyperexcitability but is also associated with axonal degeneration and neuronal death. Now what is hypothesized, but remains to be demonstrated is whether the hyperexcitability is responsible for the axonal degeneration. In vitro experiments confirmed that 1) these mutations induced modification of the biophysical properties of the different Navs in cell expression system and 2) led to DRG neurons hyperexcitability. These two combined approaches however present limitations. HEK cells do not express endogenous Navs proteins and are thus widely used to characterize the effect of a mutation on a particular canal biophysical properties. However the modulation of activity of the channel might significantly vary between different cell types and HEK cells do not necessarily reflect DRG neurons. Another limitation of cell expression system is that HEK cells no not express potassium channel, consequently the effect of these mutations on the overall cellular excitability cannot be investigated under current clamp mode (recording of action potentials is not possible). To study the effect of mutation on cellular excitability, another approach using primary culture of mice nociceptive neurons transfected with human Nav1.7 containing the specific mutation is commonly used. The main limitation of this approach is that the mutated human cDNA is expressed together with the two wild-type mice alleles; thus there is an interspecies gene coexpression and a contamination of the mutated cDNA with the endogenous allele. Another approach to investigate these single mutations of Nav1.7/1.8/1.9 would be to generate knock-in mice harbouring these mutations. But generating such knock-in mice line with the traditional approach is laborious and time consuming and has consequently never been performed in the pain field. It is well-known that upon repetitive stimulation of the primary afference, the input into the central nervous system will be potentiated. The synaptic strength between primary and secondary order neuron is increased, ultimately leading to the hyperexcitability of the dorsal horn nociceptive neurons. This process is referred to as central sensitization, a mechanism first described by Clifford Woolf, and that has been extensively studied since then. Nothing is known on the effect of the gain-of-function mutations of Nav1.7 on mechanisms of central sensitization. It is likely that the increased excitability observed in the periphery will also lead to a strengthening of the spinal cord input.AIMBecause the use of human cell lines and primary nociceptive neuron cultures both show limitations (discussed above) in AIM 1 we plan to investigate the effect of Nav1.7/1.8/1.9 I-SNF mutations on human nociceptor-like neurons excitability. We will also test the hypothesis of whether the hyperexcitability is responsible for the axonal degeneration observed in I-SFN.We will use a two-step experimental approach: 1) we will transdifferentiate human fibroblasts into nociceptor-like neurons and 2) we will use the clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system to generate these mutations in the aforementioned human nociceptive neurons. We will determine whether these mutated human nociceptive neurons also present a hyperexcitable phenotype using electrophysiology (using both voltage- and current-clamp and calcium imaging) similarly to what is observed with HEK293 cells and sensory neurons primary culture. We will then compare the observed electrical pattern with the one obtained from nociceptors derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with these mutations (from Ingemar Merkies, a collaborator of Prof. Woolf). The impact of these mutations on the cellular excitability using this approach will give results that are physiologically closer to what happens in humans and also provide a proof-of-concept that this new experimental approach is relevant. To have better insight on the in vivo effect of Nav1.7/1.8/1.9 I-SNF mutations, in AIM 2 we will also take advantage of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate knock-in mice harboring these mutations and test whether these mice develop I-SNF. We will use optogenetics, a tool that allows a very precise spatiotemporal control of neuronal excitability, to investigate how these mutations modify the cellular excitability of sensory neurons upon exogenous stimulation. In AIM3 we will again take advantage of optogenetics to investigate whether stimulation of nociceptors harbouring Nav1.7/1.8/1.9 I-SNF mutations with blue light strengthen the input into the spinal cord.Finally, as I extensively investigated Nedd4-2 effect on Navs turnover, in AIM 4 I will also use the CRISPR/Cas9 system to mutate this ubiquitin ligase in nociceptors-like human neurons and in mice and test the hypothesis that this leads to an increased neuronal excitability and pain hypersensitivity.

These projects include:1.Nup98/HoxB4 immortalized hematopoietic stem cells.These cells will used to analyze the function of the differentially expressed genes in the 4 EPLM subpopulations. Moreover, we will establish the CRISPR/Cas9 genetic editing system in these HSC’s.2.The transcription factor DuxblWe will decipher the molecular mechanism underlying the apoptosis induction by Duxbl. Moreover, we will analyze the effect of Duxbl silencing on B and T cell development. Especially we will test if this silencing can improve T cell development in preTa deficient mice and B cell development in ?5 deficient mice.3.The interplay of FLT3L and IL-7 in early hematopoietic development.We will perform RNA sequencing on the 4 EPLM subpopulations in order to identify differentially expressed genes. The function of these genes will be tested in the immortalized HSC’s (see above). Moreover, we will analyze the interplay of FLT3L and IL-7 in the development of the EPLM populations. Therefore, wild type, FLT3L transgenic, IL-7 transgenic, FLT3l deficient, IL-7 deficient, FLT3l deficient IL-7 transgenic, IL-7 deficient FLT3L transgenic and FLT3L and IL-7 double transgenic mice will be generated and analyzed. 4.The potential of IL-2 anti IL-2 immune complexes in preventing and/or inhibiting chronic Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD)The chronic Graft versus Host reaction results in the development of a disease resembling systemic lupus erythematosus in man. Now we will analyze if IL-2 anti IL-2 immune complexes which can expand various T cell subsets can prevent and/or inhibit this disease development.

315    Dr Nelson Andrew    Life Sciences Institute Division of Science Brandeis University    2017-01-01    2018-06-30    The molecular basis of cold- and hygro-sensing in Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae.    The understanding basic biological mechanisms, like for example the sensation of external stimuli are the foundation for medical relevant studies. In the last 100 years, Drosophila melanogaster has been established as a genetically accessible model organism and is used for basic research. The extensive molecular toolset available for the fruit fly combined with the conservation of many processes compared with other organisms, makes this organism suitable for studying many questions. In this comparative and interdisciplinary proposal, we will use the genetically accessible, well-studied model of Drosophila melanogaster to probe the molecular details of moisture/humidity sensing. This is of special importance, as basic understanding of the mechanism how cold or humidity is sensed on the cellular level is not described to date. The sensation of high temperature in Drosophila is mediated by different receptor molecules, among them members of a conserved family of receptors, the transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channels. These receptors were found to be thermo-receptors in many organisms from flies to humans {Patapoutian, 2005 #100}. Recently the Ionotropic Receptors IR25a and IR93a were identified as key mediators of cold and hygrosensation in the fruit fly by Prof Garritys lab. Interestingly, both of these receptors can produce multiple alternative receptor isoforms with potentially distinct functions. Furthermore, whether the receptor complexes participate in hygro- or cold sensing seems to depend on a third receptor. Detailed analysis of the different isoforms and receptor complexes will bring insights into basic molecular mechanisms of sensory cells and polymodality of these receptors. In further experiments, we will use of the newly established CRISPR/Cas9 system in mosquitos to analyze, whether basic mechanisms of cold and moisture sensing are conserved between species. The goal is to establish a molecular model of cold and moisture sensing in Drosophila and to transfer knowledge gained to Anopheles gambiae, a malaria-transmitting insect in the second part of the proposal. Identification and detailed description of receptors that are used for host seeking in this mosquito are potential targets for insect repellants or traps.

Organ shape is to a large extent determined by cell behaviour and cell behaviour is to a large extent regulated by cell-cell interaction and cell-matrix interaction, as well as by cell-cell signalling.A major interest of my laboratory over the last few years has been to determine how branching morphogenesis restructures epithelial or endothelial structures such as the insect tracheal or the vertebrate vasculature. We have used high resolution live imaging with different marker proteins to analyse cell behaviour in vivo during the branching process. We are now increasing our efforts to better understand the molecular control of the relevant cell behaviours. With the help of the recently introduced genome editing tool Crispr/Cas, the task to mutate candidate genes has become straightforward, and we have already generate several mutants and characterized their role in angiogenesis. Since many genes/proteins are actively rather broadly and are required for basic cell functions such as cellular trafficking, cell division, etc., we have started to develop protein-manipulation tools which eventually should allow us to manipulate proteins in a cell- and time-induced manner. These tools are based on protein binders and we have pioneered the use of the later in multicellular systems some time ago. We are developing such protein-binder tools for proteins of interest in order to use them for protein trapping, degradation, miss-localization, ect. These studies should allow a novel view on the role of many proteins in angiogenesis, and pave the way to a molecular understanding of the fascinating process of branching morphogenesis.In the next granting period, we would like to address the following questions:1)How are cell rearrangement controlled and coordinated during the different steps of angiogenesis?2)How is the lumen formed during sprouting and anastomosis3)How are cell rearrangements and lumen formation controlled at the molecular level?In order to answer these questions, we will take the following experimental strategies:1)We will analyse the role of several proteins involved in the regulation of Ve-cadherin in cell rearrangements.2)We will analyse the role of trafficking in cell rearrangement and lumen formation.3)We will develop novel protein binder tools to manipulate proteins possibly involved in the above processes in a cell- and time-specific manner.4)We will try to establish CLEM in order to look at high resolution into endothelial cell during the branching process.

317    Dr Nelson Andrew    University of Basel    2014-12-01    2017-11-30    In vivo cell biology of organ morphogenesis    Project: In vivo cell biology of organ morphogenesis1 .Summary of the research planOrgans and tissues acquire particular three-dimensional shapes during development, which are intimately linked to the particular function(s) an organ has to fulfil. Organ shape is to a large extent determined by cell behaviour, and cell behaviour is to a large extent regulated by cell-cell signalling and cell mechanics. A major interest of my laboratory over the last few years has been to determine how branching morphogenesis restructures epithelial tissues to generate such fascinating structures as the trachea or the vasculature. While we have initially put much effort in understanding this process in vivo in an invertebrate system (tracheal development in Drosophila melanogaster) using state of the art genetics in combination with high resolution live imaging, we have recently moved much of our research efforts to vertebrates, in particular to zebrafish (Danio rerio). Using high resolution in vivo imaging, we have described the cellular activities during angiogenesis, in particular during sprouting, vessel fusion and vessel pruning. To our surprise, we find that the plasticity of developing vessels is accompanied by unexpected cell behaviour; endothelial cells can fission and self-fuse during anastomosis and pruning, respectively. With the advent of the recently introduced genome manipulation tools (TALEN, CRISPR/Cas9), a genetic dissection of the different steps in angiogenesis is now possible at unprecedented level, and proteins can be tagged at endogenous loci and used as marker for high resolution live imaging. We have recently applied intracellular nanobodies for the first time in developing drosophila embryos to directly manipulate protein function, in particular for protein degradation. We used an anti-GFP nanobody fused to an F-box in degrade GFP-fusion proteins (we called the method “deGradFP” for degrading GFP). In the meantime, we have functionalized the anti-GFP nanobody manifold, so that it can be used for in vivo protein trapping, protein localisation and for post-translation modification of proteins of interest. During the next granting period, we will introduce the use of intracellular nanobodies (and other protein binders) for studying the zebrafish vascular system, in particular to answer the following questions:Q1: How is the dynamic cell behaviour during sprouting controlled?Q2: How do endothelial cells recognize each other in order to connect?Q3: Which molecular processes are involved in luminal membrane expansion?Q4: Which molecular processes are involved in membrane fusion and membrane fission?In order to answer these questions, we propose to undertake the following experimental strategies:1) Investigate the role of VE-cad in the dynamic rearrangements of endothelial cells.2) Generate and use cutting edge in vivo live imaging tools to characterize molecular aspects of cell behaviour during angiogenesis processes.3) Generate and analyse mutations in candidate genes affecting distinct cellular activities.4) Generate and use novel tools to manipulate protein function in vivo - a step closer to a synthetic biology approach to organ formation.

318    Dr Nelson Andrew    Camargo Laboratory Children's Hospital Boston    2017-05-01    2018-10-31    The role of YAP in liver cancer    Hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocellular carcinoma are the most common neoplasms of the liver and a global health concern, with very limited systemic treatment options.The Hippo/YAP-signaling pathway is an important regulator of liver organ size, as well as liver cell fate, and has been implicated in development of liver cancer. While the core Hippo pathway has been studied extensively, little is known about the actual downstream target effectors of YAP, which promote transcriptional output, especially in the context of tumorigenesis.We hypothesize that YAP is transcriptionally regulating relevant oncogenic drivers downstream to induce and maintain cancer. We further assume that dysregulated YAP is one of the important drivers of tumor maintenance. The aim of this ongoing project is to screen for and evaluate biologically relevant target effectors downstream of YAP and to better understand the role of YAP in tumor maintenance in the context of liver cancer.In the last months, we established an in vivo screen using a mouse model with hepatocyte-specific overexpression of a constitutive active YAP protein by deleting selected YAP target genes with a library of genomically integrated sgRNAs using the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system. Biologically and therapeutically attractive hits of the screen will be genetically and pharmacologically validated.Furthermore, we want to study the effect of YAP knockout in the setting of established liver tumors. To this end we are introducing CRISPR-Cas9 mediated mutations in commonly alterated tumor suppressor genes, and once liver tumors have established, analyze them for YAP activation and the effect of cancer cell-specific YAP knockout on tumor growth and biology.This study will provide a first systematic description of YAP targets in the context of carcinogenesis, and these findings have the potential to identify important downstream effectors as cancer drug targets. Further, we are going to better understand the biology of YAP in already established tumors.    Swiss National Science Foundation    Advanced Postdoc.Mobility    1007938.0CHF
319    Dr Nelson Andrew    University of Geneva    2016-03-01    2019-02-28    EvoDevo and Physics of Skin Colours    A few years ago, I obtained a SINERGIA grant together with Prof. Matthias Zwicker (Computer Science, Bern) and Dirk van der Marel (Condense Matter Physics, Geneva) with the ambition to initiate integration of biological, physical, and computer science approaches for a better understanding of skin colours and patterns of skin appendages and colour in amniotes. The skin appendages and pigmentation systems in vertebrates are promising model systems because species exhibit astonishing variations in skin appendage morphologies, as well as colour and colour patterns generated by pigments (black/brown, yellow and red) and structural elements (photonic crystals) incorporated into various types of chromatophores and iridophores, respectively. This variation is of great ecological importance as scales, feathers, hairs, and spines provide mechanical protection, and colours play critical roles in thermoregulation, photoprotection, camouflage, display, and reproductive isolation (hence, speciation). Our SINERGIA project was a success as we (a) Developed innovative robotics and computer graphics methods for automated phenotyping of skin surface (Martins, et al. 2015), (b) Used these developments for the analysis of scale patterns in crocodiles, a study that allowed us to uncover an entirely new developmental mechanism (Milinkovitch, et al. 2013), (c) Characterised unique multi-sensory micro-organs in the skin of crocodiles (Di-Poi and Milinkovitch 2013), (d) Characterised the development of skin appendages in the spiny mouse (Montandon, et al. 2014), (e) Characterised through histology, mass-spectrometry, photonic methods, and in-silico simulations the interactions between photonic nanostructures and pigmentary elements that generate extensive colour pattern variation in Phelsuma lizards (Saenko, et al. 2013), (f) Used mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data and Support-Vector-Machine (SVM) approaches to characterise the phylogeography of colour pattern variation in panther chameleons (Grbic, et al. 2015), (g) Combined biology and photonics to show that chameleons shift colour through active tuning of a lattice of guanine nanocrystals within a superficial thick layer of dermal iridophores (Teyssier, et al. 2015), (h) Characterised the physical parameters of surface-grating nano-structures (using electron and atomic-force microscopy) that are responsible for iridescence in snakes, and (i) used the knowledge acquired in point h to develop a new technique for computationally-effective and interactive simulation and rendering of diffraction effects produced by such biological nano-structures (Dhillon, et al. 2014). In addition, for linkage-mapping analyses, we have been continuously establishing, these last six years, families of corn snakes and lizards segregating mono-locus skin colour and colour pattern phenotypes.In the present multidisciplinary project, I propose to capitalise on our collaborations and combined expertise in computer science, physics and evolutionary developmental biology for the identification of the physical and biochemical self-organisation mechanisms underlying the formation of skin pigmentation and skin structural colours in squamate reptiles. This will require the development of biological and physical assays as well as new computer science methods, but the project will be greatly facilitated by the equipment, methodologies, and biological material, as well as the close multidisciplinary collaborations, that we have developed in the past. First, we will finalise the linkage mapping analysis of colour pattern mutations in snakes to identify the genes involved in these spectacular phenotypes. Second, we will produce ex-vivo culture of embryonic skin and tissue-disrupted in-vitro cell cultures from reptilian skin and we will treat these samples with pharmacological agents and CRISPR/Cas9 transgenesis to characterise the role of the identified (by linkage mapping) pathways in normal and mutant patterning. In parallel, we will improve and extend our 3D geometry and colour texture acquisition pipeline, perform quantitative analyses of phenotypes, characterise their variation, track changes during their development, and develop mathematical models to simulate pattern formation using Partial-Differential-Equations, Finite-Element and multi-resolution and Cell Automata Methods, all guided by our results on ex-vivo and in-vitro cultures. Third, we will perform hyperspectral imaging and advanced photonic crystallography (using scatterometry and near-field techniques) in chameleons, other lizards and snakes. These analyses will uncover the detailed physical and biological mechanisms explaining how squamate reptiles generate and manipulate structural colours, for example for changing colour during display as shown in our recent article on chameleons (Teyssier et al. 2015). The project is at the frontier between the physics of biology and evolutionary developmental biology. My multidisciplinary team of researchers (including physicists, computer scientists, developmental biologists, and evolutionary biologists), as well as the access to the laboratory equipment and competences in photonics of Prof. Dirk van der Marel’s team, will greatly facilitate our analyses of the evolution and ecological significance of signalling pathways and self-organisational phenomena involved in the determinism of adaptive skin colours and colour patterns.

320    Dr Nelson Andrew    University of Lausanne    2014-09-01    2017-03-31    Role of the TAT-RasGAP317-326 peptide in drug-induced apoptosis of childhood tumour cells    Childhood cancer still represents the second cause of mortality after accidents in Switzerland. Paediatric tumours have particularly benefited from advances in research in the last 30 years. However the treatment-associated long-term side effects induced by their lack of specificity to tumour cells and high dosage administration remain a challenging problem. As children are by definition long-term survivors, there is a strong need for the development of new, low-toxicity, better targeted and efficient therapeutic strategies for all types of childhood cancers. TAT-RasGAP317-326 is a cell-permeable peptide derived from the p120 RasGAP protein. This peptide does not modulate cell death by itself but, potently sensitizes adult tumour cells in vitro and in vivo to various anti-cancer treatments, including genotoxins and radiotherapy. Importantly, it displays specificity to cancer cells as it does not sensitize non-tumoral cells to genotoxin-induced apoptosis. TAT-RasGAP317-326 may therefore be of considerable benefit to children by increasing the efficacy of anti-cancer therapies, which could allow to lower their dosage and associated side-effects. Very encouraging in vitro preliminary results, obtained by screening various childhood cancer cell lines, indicate that pediatric tumours are sensitive to the sensitizing action of TAT-RasGAP317-326. As a consequence, we propose to undertake this project in collaboration with two laboratories. The first one is the Research in Pediatric Oncology Laboratory of CHUV directed by Dr Nicole Gross, who has extensive expertise in the biological and genetic mechanisms involved in the development of neuroblastoma, Ewing’s sarcoma and medulloblastoma. They have also developed in vivo orthotopic models for these types of tumours. The second one is the laboratory of Prof. Christian Widmann, who is highly experienced in the field of apoptosis and has developed the TAT-RasGAP317-326 peptide. This complementary expertise is a great advantage for both in vitro and in vivo experimentations. The aims of the present project are:•In vitro assessment of the response of childhood cancer cells to sensitization by TAT-RasGAP317-326; •Evaluation of the clinical potential of TAT-RasGAP317-326 by exploring its in vivo efficacy using well-characterized orthotopic and heterotopic nude mouse models;•Elucidation of the mode of action of TAT-RasGAP317-326 and more specifically its targets using both an unbiased immune-based pull-down approach and CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-Cas9) knockout technology.

321    Dr Nelson Andrew    University of Basel    2016-10-01    2019-09-30    Characterization of the interaction network of exported proteins in Plasmodium falciparum    The rational to study the interaction network of exported proteins in Plasmodium falciparum lies in the crucial importance of the export of virulence factors to the surface of infected host cells and other modifications allowing the parasite’s survival in its host cell which are the sole cause of morbidity and mortality.P. falciparum, the deadliest form of malaria, exports during its blood cycle over 10% of its proteome into the host cell leading to major host cell modifications such as presentation of adhesins on the surface or change of membrane rigidity and permeability. Why the parasites need to export such large number of proteins is unknown and their interaction is not understood. Only for a small number of proteins a tentative function was determined and hardly any information on exported proteins in the transmission forms, the gametocytes exist.With this project, we aim to elucidate the dynamic interaction network of exported proteins in P. falciparum and their contribution to morbidity during the entire erythrocytic life cycle including gametocytes. Recent technical advances to genetically manipulate P. falciparum make this project more feasible. Using the CRISPR/CAS9 system we will generate knock out parasites of a number of selected exported proteins including a number of PHIST proteins, which were frequently found in the host cell and for which we have shown that they play an important role in anchoring the virulence factor PfEMP1 to the cytoskeleton. With this system but also the alternative selection linked transfection we will generate inducible knock down clones or introduce endogenous tags. All clones will be used for phenotypical analyses using an array of established and innovative methods (e.g. microsphiltration membrane rigidity measures, electron-microscopy for ultrastructural analyses). Protein-protein interaction will be identified using conventional immuno-precipitations but also the BioID system which introduces a promiscuous biotin ligase, which subsequently allows the identification of biotinylated proteins that were in close proximity of the protein of interest. Potential interactions will be confirmed and validated by various techniques such as NMR, fluorescent polarization experiments, fluorescence cross correlation spectroscopy, or split GFP system.We finally expect to obtain through this project an interaction network that is important for Maurer’s cleft function and transport and fixation of PfMP1 on the erythrocyte surface. In particular, we expect clarification of the function of PHIST proteins and their interaction with host cytoskeleton proteins.    Swiss National Science Foundation    Project funding (Div.

322    Dr Nelson Andrew    Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Harvard Medical School    2016-08-01    2019-07-31    Identification of novel targets to correct differentiation defects in acute myeloid leukemia by state-of-the-art CRISPR screening technology    Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a devastating disease. Uncontrolled proliferation and maturation arrest are hallmarks of leukemic blasts, the disease-defining cells. Current therapies mainly focus on the deregulated proliferation of blasts; an alternative therapeutic approach is to correct the differentiation defect of leukemia cells and drive the malignant cells into terminal maturation, as successfully exemplified in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a distinct subtype of AML. The overreaching objective of this proposal is to identify and elucidate new targets for differentiation in AML, with the ultimate goal of clinical translation.Specific aims include identification of new differentiation targets using state-of-the-art CRISPR-Cas screening in AML; validation of novel candidate proteins controlling myeloid maturation in multiple models of AML; and understanding the mechanistic role of new AML differentiation targets. This study will uncover a new group of potential therapeutic targets as prime candidates for drug development that will set the stage for future trials assessing differentiation therapies in AML.

323    Dr Nelson Andrew    Department of Molecular Neuroscience Institute of Neurology University College London    2016-01-01    2017-06-30    How protein-protein interactions fine-tune the RNA specificity of RNA-binding protein TDP-43    Even though there is no cure available for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), an increase in understanding of ALS pathology pathways has been achieved by a growing scientific community. In this proposal we strive to unravel how aberrant assembly of protein-RNA complexes may contribute to ALS neuropathology. For this purpose we will analyse the ability of TDP-43, an RNA-binding protein (RBP) commonly associated with ALS, to assemble on RNA transcripts in complex with additional RBPs. We hypothesise that the low complexity region (LCR) of TDP-43 coordinates binding to other RBPs and thereby promotes cooperative RNA interactions. The aim of our study is to elucidate how the composition of TDP-43/RBP complexes influences its affinity and specificity for different RNA binding sites, and thereby affects processing of neurologically relevant transcripts. The successful completion will address basic questions regarding the formation of RNA-protein complexes, and may also uncover new therapeutic avenues for ALS treatment. Our study will involve generation of isogenic cell lines (HEK Flp-In™ and CRISPR/Cas9-edited iPS cells) that will be used for state-of-the-art interaction studies (BioID, APEX, BLI) and development of a variant iCLIP method to elucidate how and where TDP-43 binds transcripts in disease-relevant models. The results of our studies are likely to strongly impact the fields of ALS and hnRNP biology.    Swiss National Science Foundation    Early Postdoc.Mobility    530629.0CHF
324    Dr Nelson Andrew    University of Zurich    2014-07-01    2017-06-30    TCF and ß-catenin independent outputs of Wingless/Wnt signaling    A small and conserved set of signaling pathways underlies and orchestrates embryonic development and, in the adult, tissue homeostasis. To execute the diverse responses that constitute these processes the biological outputs of the pathways need to be correspondingly diverse. This can be achieved in a number of ways, such as by integrating the inputs of multiple pathways. Another potential mechanism, which has received little attention so far, is the recruitment of additional transcription factors to expand the repertoire of the genetic program that is activated. By additional factors we mean transcription factors other than the archetypal ones, such as the TCF and Gli proteins in the case of Wnt and Hedgehog signaling, respectively. For the Wnt pathway, the central tenet is that its transcriptional output is mediated by the partnership of TCF and ß-catenin; the implicit assumption being that the entire transcriptional output is mediated by TCF and ß-catenin. This belief has never been subjected to a systematic inquisition. In the proposed project we will redress this.Our approach leverages on the fact that it is now practical to routinely measure the transcriptional status of the entire genome. Additionally, novel techniques such as STARR-seq allow us to identify on a genome-wide scale the DNA regulatory regions that are responsive to signaling pathways. Perhaps most crucial of all are avant-garde genome engineering techniques, such as the CRISPR/Cas technique, which enable us to efficiently create genetic mutations - even in multiple genes simultaneously - in cell lines and in animal models. Using a combination of these state of the art techniques we will define the extent to which the transcriptional program triggered by canonical Wnts can bypass ß-catenin and/or TCFs in Drosophila and mammalian model systems. In addition to looking at activated target genes we will also investigate the phenomenon of ligand-dependent repression of target genes.1)We will generate cell lines mutant for TCF and ß-catenin using the CRISPR/Cas technique.2)We will assay the transcriptional changes triggered by the binding of Wnt ligands in these cells.3)We will use techniques such as STARR-seq and ChIP-seq to unearth responsive DNA regulatory regions.The data we generate provides the foundation for mechanistic studies that will elucidate the responsible factors, how these are incorporated into the Wnt pathway and what the biological significance of those side-pathways is during development and in disease. The insights that will be generated will promote the development of more effective therapeutic interventions into diseases where Wnt signaling is deregulated.

325    Thiel Volker    Other Research Institutes    2017-09-01    2021-08-31    Host innate immune responses to viral RNA    'Host innate immune responses to viral RNA'Background: Coronaviruses (CoVs) are RNA viruses that have long been known to cause severe disease in livestock and companion animals. In humans, severe and fatal respiratory diseases have been observed through the emergence of zoonotic CoVs, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. CoVs are well known to efficiently evade early innate immune responses and enzymatic functions within - and virus-host interactions at - the CoV replication/transcription complex (RTC) are key to efficiently evade early innate immune responses. Working hypothesis and aims: We hypothesize that induction of early innate immune responses to CoV heavily rely on the ability of host cell innate immune sensors to access and recognize viral RNA and that CoVs have evolved efficacious mechanisms to prevent early detection of viral RNA. We further hypothesize that these early virus-host interactions predominantly take place at the CoV RTC. In order to mechanistically understand these innate immune evasion strategies, we will “illuminate” the cellular environment of the CoV RTC to identify host cell factors that are required for CoV replication, and host cell factors that are targeting the CoV RTC to restrict CoV replication. The reverse genetic systems for the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and well characterized recombinant mutant viruses will be used in combination with murine and human models of infection to dissect key steps and key molecules involved in early innate immune responses on the molecular level. We will furthermore employ state-of-the-art technologies involving biotin ligase-mediated proximity labeling and proteomics, CRISPR/Cas9-based functional screens, and transcriptomics in combination with ribosomal profiling to obtain a detailed mechanistic view on (i) key interactions involved in early innate immune responses, (ii) the kinetics of these interactions and (iii) the kinetics of the global host cell response under well-defined conditions. These studies will provide spatial and temporal view of basic principles of viral RNA recognition and antiviral innate immune mechanisms in different primary cell types following virus infection. Expected significance: Our proposed studies will reveal basic principles of viral RNA sensing and antiviral innate immune effector mechanisms that are highly relevant also beyond CoV infections. We expect to identify key molecules, mechanisms and pathways that promote or restrict viral replication at the site of viral RNA synthesis. This information will further our understanding on fundamental aspects of viral RNA synthesis and innate immune responses to RNA virus infection, and will facilitate the development of novel strategies to interfere with viral RNA replication during the early phase of infections.

326    Zingg Daniel    Jonkers Laboratory Molecular Pathology Netherlands Cancer Institute    2018-04-01    2019-09-30    Identifying Drivers of Invasive Lobular Breast Carcinoma.    Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignancy in women, with an incidence of one in eight being affected within their lifetime. This emphasizes the need to improve breast cancer prevention and treatment. Breast carcinomas are divided into several clinical subtypes. Among these is invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), which is characterized by neoplastic mammary cells invading the surrounding stroma in a dispersed, discohesive growth pattern. This phenotype is based on dysfunctional cell-cell adhesion, primarily driven by lack of E-cadherin (CDH1) protein expression. Consequently, most ILCs display loss-of-function alterations of the CDH1 locus. Although several recurrent genetic alterations have been identified in human ILC, only a few of these genes have been functionally studied in mice in the context of Cdh1 loss. Hence, more systematic approaches are required to functionally and comprehensively decipher the molecular processes of ILC initiation and metastatic progression.Prof. Jonkers’ laboratory at the Netherlands Cancer Institute - Antoni van Leeuwenhoek hospital (NKI- AVL), has demonstrated considerable expertise in modeling breast cancer using 3D organotypic cultures and diverse genetically engineered mouse models. Moreover, a recently introduced culture method has enabled 2D in vitro propagation of primary murine mammary epithelial cells (MMECs). To this end, MMEC cultures derived from wild-type or Cdh1-floxed mice will serve as platform to conduct CRISPR/Cas9-based, genome-wide screening approaches. Candidate genes promoting MMEC proliferation in conjunction with Cdh1 loss will be further evaluated in a rapid, non-germline CRISPR/Cas9-dependent mouse model of ILC. Of note, the MMEC culture system will also be instrumental to expand and functionally study human primary cells derived from ILCs and corresponding precursor-type lesions. This will complement the data arising from murine ILC-modeling, thus ultimately unraveling novel drivers of human ILC. Taken together, these findings will deepen the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of ILC and may have substantial translational impact on breast cancer prognosis and therapy.

327    Dr Elias Salah Karim    University of Southampton    2018-12-01    2020-12-01    Uncovering the Molecular Mechanisms of Asymmetric Cell Divisions in Mammalian Adult Epithelia    Loss of asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs) regulation in the normal self-renewing stem cells is entwined with the growth and progression of poorly differentiated cancers. Yet, the molecular mechanisms controlling the execution of symmetric versus asymmetric divisions in adult epithelia are still unfolding. We recently demonstrated that KIF5/kinesin-1 is essential for mammary epithelial cell divisions and cytoarchitecture by governing the trafficking of the spindle orientation and apical polarity components, respectively. Whether KIF5/kinesin-1 couples spindle orientation and polarity machineries during mitosis to promote ACDs; and whether other mechanisms are involved remain open questions. Here, we will address these questions in mammary 3D organoids. We will use CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to generate cells expressing AID-tagged endogenous KIF5/kinesin-1 to allow inducible and rapid degradation of the microtubule motor specifically during mitosis, for a precise evaluation of the role it plays in ACDs. We generated cells expressing GFP-tagged LGN –a key player in the spindle orientation machinery–to purify and analyse the LGN-containing complex by LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry and identify novel factors that participate to ACDs. These studies will elucidate the molecular mechanisms of ACDs in the mammary epithelia and provide rational for subsequent detailed investigations in vivo of their precise roles in development and homeostasis.

328    Dr. van Spriel Annemiek    Radboud University Nijmegen    2017-10-01    2022-09-30    The cell surface tetraspanin web drives tumour development and alters metabolic signalling    Cancer development is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation, cell survival and metabolic reprogramming. Tumour cells are surrounded by a fluid-mosaic membrane that contains tetraspanins (Tspans) which are evolutionary conserved proteins important in the formation of multiprotein complexes at the cell surface (‘tetraspanin web’). Increasing evidence indicates that Tspans are involved in cancer, still the architecture of the Tspan web in native tumour membranes and its (patho)physiological functions have not been resolved. Based on my preliminary data, I hypothesize that tumour cells contain a disrupted Tspan web in which Tspan interactions are modified leading to aberrant metabolic signalling and tumour development. This is supported by my discovery that loss of Tspan CD37 leads to spontaneous lymphomagenesis due to activation of the Akt survival pathway. The overall aim of Secret Surface is to unravel the composition, physiological functions and molecular mechanisms of the Tspan web on tumour development and clinical outcome. To achieve this, I will focus on studying lymphomas using a multidisciplinary approach: I. Detailed analyses of Tspan web composition in lymphoma to select clinically relevant Tspans (high-throughput tissue microarray technology, multispectral imaging). II. Resolve the endogenous Tspan web on lymphoma cells (super-resolution microscopy), and generation and analysis of lymphoma cells that have a complete deficiency of multiple Tspans (CRISPR/Cas9 technology). III. Decipher molecular mechanisms underlying Tspan web function in lymphoma cells (membrane organization, membrane-proximal signalling, metabolic reprogramming). With my unique toolbox of Tspan knock-outs coupled to advanced microscopy and metabolic studies, I expect that Secret Surface will lead to a new concept in cellular physiology in which cell surface organization by the Tspan web drives tumour development, which may open new horizons for the generation of new cancer therapies.

330    Professor Mongan Nigel    University of Zurich    2015-10-01    2018-09-30    Cyst wall formation: a persistent challenge in Toxoplasmosis    The acute phase of Toxoplasma gondii infection initiates with the rapid proliferation and dissemination of the fast-replicating form of the parasite (tachyzoite) throughout the vertebrate host. At the onset of the immune response, the tachyzoites are efficiently neutralized and the infection enters in a chronic phase with conversion to a slow-replicating developmental stage (bradyzoite) that forms tissue cysts predominantly in the central nervous system and in striated and heart muscle. This process of encystation is vital to the parasite’s life cycle because i) it ensures survival and life-long persistence in intermediate hosts, and ii) it allows peroral transmission to the feline definitive host, initiating the sexual cycle. Tissue cysts not only prevent eradication of the parasite, but also pose a significant threat of reactivation in the context of host immunosuppression and can lead to encephalitis and other severe clinical manifestations.Despite the central importance of cyst formation for pathogenesis and transmission, our insight into how T. gondii defies the innate and adaptive immune responses to take up permanent residence in the immunocompetent hosts is rudimentary. Very little is known about the cyst wall composition and the molecular processes governing its formation. We have a very fragmented view of the temporal and spatial dissemination of cysts in the host and especially in the brain. Progress in biology is driven both by medical necessity and scientific curiosity and this project, which proposes to investigate the process of encystation, lies at the intersection of these two forces. It is the most propitious time to address the challenging question of cyst wall formation in light of the most recent breakthroughs in the sensitivity of -omics approaches, the power of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in genome editing, the revolution in high-throughput microscopy, and ex-vivo tissue examination at the highest level of resolution.This ambitious and highly synergistic project tackles key biological questions on tissue cyst formation and capitalizes heavily on cutting-edge technologies to address three specific objectives:1. A comprehensive definition of the cyst wall composition. We will generate an unprecedentedly accurate transcriptome of the bradyzoite stage and a differential proteome of bradyzoites and the surrounding cyst wall. The data will be curated via a powerful comparative genomics approach spanning cyst-forming and cyst-lacking Apicomplexa species. A complementary mutagenesis and selection strategy is designed to identify specific defects in cyst formation or maturation by large-scale genetic screens using quantitative high-throughput microscopy.2. An uncovering of molecular mechanisms governing the cyst wall formation. This aim will be accomplished by taking a targeted as well as a global functional approach. Starting from recent findings on parasitophorous vacuole formation of tachyzoites we will implement a semi-targeted gene knockout- or conditional knockout approach. Moreover, the creation of a comprehensive gene disruption collection in subproject 1 will allow identification of all non-essential tachyzoites genes that display trafficking defects during cyst formation. Key mutants will be mechanistically dissected in vitro with a subset to be investigated further in vivo. 3. A spatiotemporal cartography of cyst formation in the brain. We will harness cutting-edge imaging methods to investigate the in vivo dynamics of dissemination and cyst formation in the whole body and foremost in the brain of a mouse infection model. These findings will inform development of spatiotemporal models describing parasite dissemination and differentiation, to be correlated with data from post-mortem biopsies. By combining unbiased and targeted experimental approaches, we are poised to achieve major conceptual advances in deciphering the molecular events leading to cyst wall formation. In the long term, the data and technology created in this project will lay the foundation to decoding the molecular information exchange between host and pathogen during establishment of life-long latent infections. These studies fill a significant knowledge gap and will provide i) highly valuable web-accessible integrated gene expression data, ii) fundamental discoveries about the regulatory and trafficking circuits that govern formation of the cyst wall as a biological barrier during encystation iii) invaluable paradigms of how the parasite initiates and sustains molecular programs required for disease progression and persistence.

331    Professor Mongan Nigel    Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard    2017-04-01    2019-03-31    Mitochondrial adaptations to fluctuating nutrient conditions    A key element of life is the ability to sense and utilize different nutrient fuel sources - enabling robust viability in the face of changing conditions. Over the course of evolution, eukaryotes have acquired mitochondria to perform efficient energy conversion from food and oxygen into ATP, a process called oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Mitochondrial OXPHOS and cytosolic glycolysis are the two major pathways for generating cellular ATP and cells are exquisitely tuned to dynamically match nutrient fuel sources and energy demands. Much of our understanding of mitochondrial and metabolic rewiring in response to fuel sources has been elucidated using yeast as a model system. However we currently lack a systems biology view of this process in humans. Elucidating these fundamental cellular pathways is crucial for understanding and treating mitochondrial dysfunction, which underlies human diseases ranging from neonatal lethality to type II diabetes, cancer and neurodegeneration.In exciting preliminary studies, I have harnessed the ability of human K562 cells to quickly rewire metabolism from glycolysis to mitochondrial OXPHOS when glucose is replaced by galactose in the media. Here, I propose to leverage our lab’s deep expertise in genomics and systems biology to decipher mechanisms underlying the mitochondrial “activation” and “deactivation” in response to changes in sugar availability. Specifically, I will (1) identify the markers of mitochondrial activation by systematic RNA, protein and metabolite profiling during nutrient shifting, (2) identify genetic drivers of mitochondrial activation using genome-wide CRISPR and ORF screening and (3) integrate these results to decipher molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial activation. These findings are likely to help our understanding of cellular metabolism as well as mitochondrial function and pathologies.

332    Professor Mongan Nigel    University of Basel    2017-08-01    2018-07-31    Improving CRISPR-Cas9 efficiency using small molecules to modulate chromatin structure    Gene therapy holds the possibility to revolutionize the way otherwise incurable genetic diseases are treated. In principle, it allows for the DNA within a cell to be changed. With the dawn of new gene editing technologies such as CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 9), repairing mutations within human cells has become reality. Our ability to program this bacterial defense mechanism with human target sequences has unlocked unprecedented possibilities for gene therapy and personalized medicine.While deleting a gene to impair its function within a cell is presently fairly easy, the reversion of a detrimental mutation back to its non-disease state is much more difficult. This requires exchange of one sequence by another, which is only entirely precise when mediated by a process called homologous recombination or homology directed repair (HDR). While CRISPR-Cas9 has made gene editing by homologous recombination easier, its efficiency remains poor. This is a major limitation that must be overcome if genome editing technologies are to be used in medical treatments or commercial applications in biotechnology. The majority of research that focuses on improving CRISPR-Cas9 has tried to modify the components of the bacterial Cas9 system. Our approach, however, addresses this problem from a completely different perspective. We have shown that one can greatly increase repair by homologous recombination by making the cell’s genome more accessible to the editing machinery. Simply put, reverting a mutation by gene editing is like trying to cut a metal wire with a pair of office scissors; this still works but is very inefficient. Instead, our method changes the metal wire into a piece of string, allowing the scissors to cut easily. The underlying evidence for this project stems from our research in budding yeast, where we showed that making DNA more accessible enhances the rate of genome integrations 4-fold. If true in mammalian cells, this research could become a fundamental aspect of genome editing, applicable not only to CRISPR-Cas9 but also to any gene editing technologies yet to come.With the support of the Bridge funding for a Proof of Concept, I will expand our previous work from yeast to human cells. I plan to develop compounds that can be used to transiently lower histone levels in human cell culture. My ultimate goal is to increase the accessibility of DNA in the context of gene editing to enhance CRISPR-Cas9 editing efficiencies in somatic cells. I aim to establish the data necessary to bridge from basic research to a tool that will enable the use of gene editing for biotech or medical applications.

333    Professor Mongan Nigel    University of Zurich    2017-10-01    2021-09-30    Mechanisms of rhabdomyosarcoma progression    The major hurdle to successful therapy for pediatric sarcomas such as rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) re-mains metastatic and recurrent disease. In such cases, prognosis have not improved over the last dec-ades and outcome is still unacceptably low. Only a limited number of studies directly address this prob-lem, mainly because in vivo model systems to mimic recurrences and identify novel drug sensitivities are lacking. One additional problem specific to pediatric malignancies is the paucity of actionable mutations that can be identified both from diagnostic as well as relapse samples. Hence, existing recurrent genetic abnormalities such as translocation events gain additional weight and we can hypothesize that other mechanisms such as epigenetic transcriptional control might play a major role in disease development. To specifically address these topics, we suggest in this proposal to take advantage of our novel insights that have recently been obtained during the current funding period. We are also proud that we are now part of a very large European initiative which will allow us to substantially expand our collection of pa-tient-derived xenografts and which will be used in most of the proposed projects. To gain novel insights into development and treatment of recurrent disease, we will address the following specific aims: Aim 1: To establish a personalized drug screening platform and identify novel treatment vulnerabilities directly in patient derived primary cell cultures. We hypothesize that new sequencing efforts of recurrent samples have to be supplemented with functional drug screens to advance treatment of relapsed patients. In addition, our platform serves as discovery tool to identify novel mechanisms of drug resistances and novel biomarkers for patient selection.Aim 2: To further validate CHD4 as major drug target in pediatric malignancies and describe the epi-genetic landscape of fusion positive-RMS tumors in general. We hypothesize that CHD4, a newly iden-tified crucial co-factor of the RMS specific fusion protein PAX3-FOXO1, has a more widespread function as epigenetic reader than previously appreciated. In addition, we will use unbiased large scale screens to identify novel epigenetic vulnerabilities in RMS tumors.Aim 3: To identify novel (chemo)resistance mechanisms directly in patient derived tumor material and develop novel rational combinatorial treatment strategies. Using both unbiased in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 drop-out screens and a hypothesis driven approach investigating the contribution of hedgehog signaling, and by comparing diagnostic versus relapse samples from the same patients, we will identify resistance mechanisms that will guide combinatorial drug development, aiming at re-sensitizing tumors that are resistant to commonly applies chemotherapeutics. We expect that this follow-up proposal will provide relevant novel insights into RMS biology and pro-gression by working directly with patient material and will contribute novel pre-clinical information to guide development of targeted therapies into early phase I/II clinical protocols.

334    Professor Mongan Nigel    Other Research Institutes    2017-06-01    2021-05-31    Serpin regulation of leukocyte proteases in cellular homeostasis and inflammation    Serine proteases carried in cytoplasmic granules or lysosomes of granulocytes, monocytes, mast cells, cytotoxic lymphocytes and NK cells contribute to both protective and destructive inflammatory and immune responses. A plethora of functions have been attributed to these proteases such as killing pathogens, inactivating toxins, inducing death of infected or cancer cells, modulating cytokine activity and remodeling extracellular matrix proteins. Much progress has been made in the last decade in understanding the functions of intracellular serpins which inhibit granule proteases of immune cells. Importantly, we have established that Serpinb1 is an essential survival factor of neutrophils (PMNs) through the inhibition of their own granule protease CatG. CatG triggers a form of programmed cell death that has features of apoptosis through activation of caspases and of regulated necrosis with rapid loss of plasma membrane integrity and release of inflammatory mediators. Although we have made significant advances, the exact molecular mechanisms leading to cell death and inflammation in the absence of intracellular serpins remain to be identified. In this project, we will use a combination of targeted (hypothesis-driven) and untargeted (degradomics and phenotype screening) methods to address the knowledge gaps in the mechanisms of CatG-mediated cell death and in the functions of Serpinb1, Serpinb6 and Serpinb9 in vivo. In particular, we have taken the high risk, high reward approach of mouse genetics and developed unique models to directly address these important questions. The proposed project will address the following two aims: Our first specific aim is to identify the mechanisms of cell death mediated by cathepsin G in myeloid cells. We will focus on the biology of myeloid cells and further explore specific cell death pathways associated with PMN and monocyte PCD in vitro. We will use a comparative proteomic approach to identify the CatG-specific degradome in PMNs associated with cell death. The identified targets will be validated by genetic targeting, including CRISPR and Cas9 designer nuclease technology. The second specific aim is to investigate the global and individual functions of the 14 functional serpins encoded in the expanded mouse SerpinB6-SerpinB9-SerpinB1 gene cluster on mouse chromosome 13, for which we generated a complete, yet viable knock-out. We will investigate specific defects of innate and adaptive immune cell development, homeostasis in steady state and inflammatory conditions. We will particularly investigate the cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous functions of invariant NKT cell subsets, which appear to be negatively regulated by SerpinB1 and, potentially, also by other intracellular serpins of this cluster. Finally, we will perform a standardized, comprehensive phenotypic screening of mice lacking all clade B serpin genes on mouse chromosome 13. This explorative analysis will be followed by a second stage testing where identified defects will be functionally investigated for individual serpin genes and their known target proteases. Overall, this multipronged project based on animal genetics will identify and functionally validate novel proteolytic targets associated with programmed cell death and will reveal important pathophysiological mechanisms mediated by granule proteases of immune cells and their inhibitors, which will likely have implications for developmental, inflammatory, infectious and proliferative diseases.

The goals of my proposed projects is to chart previously elusive cell fates of the LPM and to uncover the molecular regulation of LPM formation using the zebrafish (Danio rerio) as principal model.

Further, an improved mechanistic grasp of LPM formation will provide a concept to understand the genetic causes of congenital cardiovascular disorders.The zebrafish embryo provides a unique model to tackle LPM formation with its rapid development, optical translucency, and potent genetic toolbox. In our previous and ongoing work, we have uncovered several cis-regulatory elements that are specifically active in the emerging LPM in different vertebrate species.

We will complement this approach in Aim 2B with somatic CRISPR-Cas9-based mutagenesis of migration- and adhesion-controlling candidate genes to elucidate how the spatio-temporal migration pattern in the LPM is coordinated.

In Aim 1A, we will combine latest transgenic zebrafish techniques to investigate the controversial origins of individual endothelial lineages during body plan formation. In Aim 1B, we will pursue the identity of individual LPM stripes, which have received conflicting definitions in the past.For Aim 2, we will chart and functionally investigate the regulatory landscape of emerging LPM territory and will probe the regulation of its dynamic cell migration. In Aim 2A, we will chart the regulatory landscape of the emerging LPM with chromatin analysis and will establish the developmental contribution of individual cis-regulatory elements as basis for targeting putative enhancers in vivo using our new CRISPR-Cas9 tools. We will complement this approach in Aim 2B with somatic CRISPR-Cas9-based mutagenesis of migration- and adhesion-controlling candidate genes to elucidate how the spatio-temporal migration pattern in the LPM is coordinated. Altogether, our aims will elucidate fundamental open questions in vertebrate development, and will establish a new paradigm for discovering and functionally validating cis-regulatory elements and molecular regulators in vivo.

340    Dr. ATANASOVA Lea    University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna    2018-03-01    2023-04-30    NEW GMC OXIDOREDUCTASES FROM CLONOSTACHYS ROSEA    Enzymes from the glucose-methanol-choline family of flavin-dependent enzymes (GMC oxidoreductases) are often linked to enzymatic combustion, a mechanism of ligninolysis involving several non-specific oxidative enzymes. Such mechanisms have mostly been described in basidiomycetous brown rot and white rot fungi, but are largely unknown in non-ligninolytic Ascomycota. Clonostachys rosea (Hypocreales, Ascomycota) is a filamentous with a broad range of ecological specializations from plant associations, saprotrophy to biotrophy and parasitism on nematodes and other fungi. Upon sequencing of C. rosea genomes, the gene family encoding GMC oxidoreductases classified as auxiliary activity family 3 (CAZy classification), specifically subfamily AA3_2 (aryl alcohol and glucose oxidases), was found to be significantly expanded. On the other hand, the genomes of the saprotrophs Neurospora crassa and Trichoderma reesei as well as the mycoparasites Trichoderma atroviride and Trichoderma virens (ecologically very similar to C. rosea) showed a significantly reduced AA3 gene content, suggesting that such enzymes are not essential for these nutritional strategies, and were either not acquired or lost by selective adaptation. This poses the question about the function of this many C. rosea paralogs, as this fungus is neither a prominent lignocellulose decomposer nor a plant pathogen, that would demand such an arsenal of genes for (ligno)cellulose degradation. The aim of this study is to elucidate the functionality and role of C. rosea GMC oxidoreductases, and identify the nutritional strategies they are involved in. Our research plan includes a transcriptional study of GMC oxidoreductases that are significantly regulated under the C. rosea major nutritional conditions, an investigation of the functional significance of GMC oxidoreductases in C. rosea (including single/multiple inactivation of genes using state-of-the-art CRISPR/Cas9 engineering tools) and biochemical characterization of selected GMC oxidoreductases that encode functional enzymes. Our large-scale approach will provide important insights in the regulation of gene families supporting different life-styles in C. rosea and highlight complex mechanisms of mycoparasitism and fungus-plant interactions.

341    Dr Correia Martins Filipe    University of Cambridge    2017-02-01    2019-01-31    Genomic and functional characterization of PTEN loss as a driver event in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) - its implications for prognosis and therapeutic response    High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the commonest and a lethal form of ovarian cancer, characterized by profound heterogeneity, prevalent TP53 mutation and BRCA1/2. Identification of new driver pathways is critical to develop credible personalised treatments. PTEN suppresses the oncogenic PI3K pathway and regulates homologous recombination (HR) and consequently its loss can be targeted by inhibitors of the PI3K and DNA repair pathways. I have recently identified that PTEN loss or downregulation is common in HGSOC (present in 281 of 447 cases), occurs mainly by copy number alterations (CNA), is associated with worse prognosis and offers possibilities for personalized therapy. My hypothesis is that the effects of PTEN activity in HGSOC are dose-dependent and expression levels and cellular localization of PTEN determine functional differences. I aim to 1) model the functional effects of PTEN haploinsufficiency or loss in tumour cell lines; 2) test small molecule inhibitors from Astrazeneca in combinations targeting PI3K pathway and HR. In aim 1, I will analyse gene expression/pathways, HR, cellular localization of proteins and drug response in CRISPR transformed HGSOC lines. For aim 2, I will develop an ex-vivo model using tumour sections from primary tumours to validate potential therapeutic combinations from aim 1 in patient material. The translational impact of this work will be to use PTEN expression/dosage as a validated biomarker for routine clinical stratification in clinical trials targeting the PTEN pathway in HGSOC. I will also develop a model to predict therapeutic response and to validate new drug combinations in pre-clinical trials.    Cancer Research UK    CCC - Post Doctoral Research Bursary    402091.54EUR
342    Dr Correia Martins Filipe    University of Geneva    2017-04-01    2021-03-31    Hsp90 molecular chaperone machines in living cells and organisms    General goals:Our long-term goal is to elucidate the in vivo functions of one of the major molecular chaperone machines of the eukaryotic nucleocytoplasm and of its mitochondrial relative. In eukaryotes, the cytosolic Hsp90 is essential, undoubtedly because of its central role in the proteostasis system. With the help of a large cohort of cofactors (co-chaperones), it associates with a substantial portion of all proteins, and constitutes a major hub of the proteome. Hsp90 clients include many regulatory and signaling proteins that depend on it to stabilize thermodynamically metastable states. The mitochondrial Hsp90 isoform Trap1, a simplified version of an Hsp90 machine, regulates cellular energy metabolism. Despite a recent explosion of the Hsp90/Trap1 literature, their in vivo functions in normal and cancer cells remain poorly understood. We propose to fill some of these knowledge gaps with a multi-pronged approach.Specific goals:•Genetic dissection of the Hsp90 machine in the mouse: Understand the global physiological and pathological functions of this molecular chaperone machine in a complex model organism. For the core components Hsp90 and Hsp90, and for the co-chaperones Aha1, Aha2, and Aarsd1, we will study the phenotypes of constitutive or conditional gene deletions at a global level and for selected tissues, and try to link phenotype with genotype mechanistically.•Functional interactions at the cellular level: Elucidate the essential functional interactions of this major molecular chaperone machine and proteome hub by genome-wide synthetic lethal and chemogenomic screens with mammalian cell lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. These screens for essential interacting genes will be done with cells lacking Hsp90, Hsp90, or the co-chaperone Stip1/Hop, or treated with an Hsp90 inhibitor or exposed to other proteostasis perturbations.•Hsp90 and cancer: Discover why cancer cells are more Hsp90-dependent and hypersensitive to Hsp90 inhibitors. A key tool for the analysis of the role of individual factors and pathways will be an isogenic pair of normal and Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells. •Synthetic chaperone: Strip Hsp90 down to the bare essentials by reconstructing it into a synthetic chaperone. Identify the absolutely essential core functions and the significance of Hsp90 heterodimers.•Live cell imaging of Hsp90 interactions: Develop luminescence resonance energy transfer with lanthanide ions as a powerful tool to do 'real-time in vivo biochemistry' of the Hsp90 machine.•Mitochondrial Hsp90 isoform Trap1: Understand how Trap1 regulates cellular energy metabolism and how this affects physiological cellular processes such as the regulation of cell size and cell migration, and, as a long-term goal, pathological events such as cancer and other diseases.

343    Dr Correia Martins Filipe    ETH Zurich    2018-02-01    2021-01-31    Non-transgenic Genome Editing in Apple    Apple is the most prominent freshly consumed fruit in Switzerland and, after banana, the second most important fruit worldwide. Most of the apple cultivars produced today are susceptible to devastating diseases such as apple scab and fire blight. Therefore, the production of fruits attaining commercial quality requires excessive pesticide input. Breeding for resistant cultivars is the most economically and environmentally sustainable approach to reduce the chemical footprint of apple production. However, the selection of novel cultivars through classical apple breeding is a long process, hampered by the long juvenility phase and self-incompatibility of this species. Methods to obtain novel traits and improve disease resistance without undergoing several long-lasting breeding cycles are therefore of great interest.Genetic engineering has been proposed as an effective way to improve apple cultivars but the resulting genetically modified organisms currently lack public acceptance. Here, we propose to implement a non-transgenic system to obtain novel traits in apple, using the most prominent genome editing tool CRISPR/Cas9. This will be achieved by transfection of apple protoplasts with preassembled Cas9/gRNA ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) which avoids the need of integration of a Cas9 expressing transgene in the target plant. Specifically, we will establish the plant material and protocols for protoplasts production in the first two tasks. Task three aims at the establishment of an effective apple protoplasts regeneration protocol. In task four, protoplasts transfection with preassembled RNPs will be optimized using a widely applied selectable marker system (GFP; green fluorescent protein / BFP; blue fluorescent protein-conversion). These optimized protocols will be used in task five to generate the first mildew-resistant apple cultivar by an MdMLO19 knockout. In the sixth (high risk - high impact) task, the established genome editing system will be tested for its feasibility to replace large DNA sequences by homology-directed double strands breaks repair.This project will develop a transformation-free genome editing system in apple and generate improved germplasm in one of the most important fruits worldwide. On the long run, the methods and protocols established here will enable allele replacement strategies at known disease resistance genes to significantly reduce pesticide input in apple production.

344    Dr Correia Martins Filipe    Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry The University of California, San Diego    2016-02-01    2018-01-31    Unraveling the mechanistic bases of the CRISPR/Cas9 system via computational methods    CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)- Cas9 is a bacterial immune system that enables protection against invading viruses. The ability of the RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 to generate double strand breaks in invading DNA has been exploited for genome engineering, resulting as a transformative technology in life sciences. In spite of its impact, the structural and mechanistic details underlying the CRISPR-Cas9 function are unclear and call for a comprehensive knowledge. The goal of this research project is to clarify the molecular bases that enable Cas9 to exert its function via computational methods integrated with experiments. State-of-the-art computational methods - electron microscopy refinement, enhanced sampling molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations - will be flanked by mutagenesis, kinetic and single molecule experiments, and by X-ray crystallography. This project will rely on the long-standing experience in computational biophysics of Prof. McCammon and on the unique capability of the University of California San Diego. It will be supported by the experimental work of Prof. Jinek at the University of Zurich. We will focus on the three main open questions of CRISPR-Cas9 biology: (1) conformational activation of Cas9 by guide RNA binding, (2) molecular mechanism of DNA recognition and (3) catalytic mechanism of double strand DNA cleavage. Answering these questions is paramount for improved understanding of the molecular bases underlying Cas9 function. The ambition embodied in this proposal is directly related to its main outcomes. It aims at providing knowledge that will address the lack of mechanistic information about CRISPR-Cas9 biology and will serve as a basis for the rational design of new Cas9-based genome-engineering applications, with the potential of impacting basic and applied science.

345    Dr Correia Martins Filipe    Max-Planck-Institut für Molekulare Genetik    2015-08-01    2017-01-31    3D Regulatory Dynamics at Limb-Associated Loci    Complex genetic regulations control the pleiotropic transcriptional activities of developmental genes. These regulations often rely upon large genomic landscapes bearing several cis-regulatory sequences. In recent years, it has been shown that the 3-dimensional (3D) folding of these genomic landscapes allows the establishment of functional contacts between enhancers and promoters. Yet, little is known about the dynamics, specificity and factors controlling these enhancer-promoter interactions. First, to address these questions, we are characterizing 470 limb-associated regulatory landscapes and their 3D dynamics using Capture-C. Moreover, using CRISPR/Cas genetic engineering, we are challenging the importance of a tissue-specific transcription factor, namely Pitx1, on the 3D folding of these regulatory landscapes. In the second part of our proposal, we aim to investigate the establishment of complex genetic regulation at two prototypical limb loci, i.e. Pitx1 and Tbx5. For this purpose we functionally dissect, using an adapted CRISPR/Cas protocol, the regulatory landscape of both loci. Using these approaches, we expect to gain significant insights into complex genetic regulation and genomic 3D folding.    Swiss National Science Foundation    Advanced Postdoc.Mobility    445698.0CHF

EVs serve as transport vesicles for the transfer of molecules between cells. Scientists are attempting to seize this property and employ it for the delivery of therapeutic molecules. At the same time, breakthrough inventions in the field of gene-editing (CRISPR Cas9), are expected to radically change biological research and consequently gene therapy approaches. This project proposal explores the potential of employing EVs as vectors for gene therapy, for the treatment of heart failure. Techniques for EV isolation from human primary and embryonic stem cells will be explored, to assess the efficacy of the production yield. Raman spectroscopy will be used to understand the interaction of EVs with target cells. Loading of EVs with plasmid DNA will be performed using transfection and active loading approaches.

347    Dr. COLE Alison    University of Vienna    2018-07-01    2022-06-30    Stem cells and cell type complexity in a sea anemone    The complexity of animal body plans can be approximated by the diversity of different cell types, yet how the observed cell type complexity has evolved and to what extent this is related to genetic complexity is one of the open fundamental questions in biology. Furthermore, how the cell types are maintained by stem cells throughout adulthood has important biomedical implications. Different from humans who age when their stem cells are depleted due to an imbalance between self-renewal and differentiation, simpler organisms, like cnidarians, continuously generate new cells from stem cells without any signs of senescence. However, the possible connection between cell type complexity, its evolution, and the non-senescent properties of stem cells in these organisms remain to be elucidated. In this project, we will identify and investigate the hitherto enigmatic stem cells and the full cell type diversity in a virtually immortal animal, the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. To this end, we will combine microfluidics-based single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), for unbiased molecular characterization of cell populations, with gene perturbation studies for assessing the functional roles of putative stem-cell marker genes. As a complementary approach, we will investigate the role of known genes commonly associated with the germline and pleuripotent stem cells. The identified candidate stem cells will be monitored by lineage tracing in transgenic animals to visualize their differentiation potential. We will test the function of the identified stem cell genes by gene knockdowns and in CRISPR/Cas9 mutants. The morphant embryos will be subjected to scRNA-seq to identify cell populations that are affected and hence, likely to be direct progenies of the stem cells. The molecular profiling will provide an objective and comprehensive basis for assessing the relationship between genetic and organismal complexity. Revealing the identity and molecular features of stem cells in this immortal animal will be key for our understanding of regenerative capacity and longevity.

Their efficient synthesis has remained a major challenge and the current limited access to these compounds severely impedes progress in modern research areas of RNA biology. The envisaged synthetic pathways also aim at increasing the structural diversity of cRNAs; this will be achieved by modifications concerning the phosphate backbone through formation of alternative internucleotide linkages (e.g. 2'-5'-, 5'-5'(3'-3')-phosphodiesters, phosphorothioates, triazoles linkages, amide linkages) and by insertion of distinct ribose modifications (e.g. 2'-OCH3, -F, -H, 2'-O–4'-C methylene (LNA monomers), 2'-tethers bearing reactive groups such as alkyne, vinyl, or amino groups). Importantly, in collaborative efforts with the team of Virginijus Siksnys, these novel cRNA derivatives will be tested for their potential as activators/inhibitors of CRISPR-associated (Cas) Csm6 ribonucleases, and additionally, in crystallographic studies aiming at a high resolution structure of the corresponding protein complexes. This cRNA–based signaling pathway has been discovered very recently and coordinates components of CRISPR-Cas to prevent phage infection and propagation. The research proposed here therefore aims at solving a fundamental scientific problem that links advanced synthetic bioorganic chemistry to highly topical research on CRISPR-Cas systems.

Over a century ago, it was first observed that symbiotic species living in hosts can provide a strong barrier against infection, beyond the host’s own defence responses. We now know that ‘protective’ microbial symbiont species are key components of plant, animal, and human microbiota, shaping host health in the face of parasite infection. I have shown that microbes can evolve within days to protect, providing the possibility that microbe-mediated defences can take-over from hosts in fighting with parasites over evolutionary time. This new discovery of an evolvable microbe-mediated defence challenges our fundamental understanding of the host-parasite relationship. Here, I will use a novel nematode-microbe interaction, an experimental evolution approach, and assays of phenotypic and genomic changes (the latter using state-of-the-art sequencing and CRISPR-Cas9 technologies) to generate new insights into the drivers and consequences of coevolving protective symbioses. Specifically, the objectives are to test: (i) the ability of microbe-mediated protection to evolve more rapidly than host-encoded resistance, (ii) the impacts of evolvable protective microbes on host-parasite coevolution, and the effect of community complexity, in the form of (iii) parasite and (iv) within-host microbial heterogeneity, in shaping host-protective microbe coevolution from scratch. Together, these objectives will generate a new, synthetic understanding of how protective symbioses evolve and influence host resistance and parasite infectivity, with far-reaching implications for tackling coevolution in communities.

Compounded by environmental factors such as diet, which varies for each person, biological noise means that diseases such as cancer manifest differently between individuals. In the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, a prevailing belief is that cancer arises when stem cells accumulate genetic mutations that cause loss-of-control over cell growth. This project provides an alternative to this paradigm: preliminary results indicate that high fat diets and obesity spur tumor development in the intestine by conferring tumor-initiating ability to additional cell types (non-stem progenitor cells). Further, initial findings illustrate that diet may be tuned to create metabolic vulnerability in tumor cells that can be targeted using (already approved) enzyme-blocking drugs. The goal for the first part of the project is to identify cancer-initiating cells in obese mice and human subjects using highly parallel microfluidic single cell transcriptomics to fully catalog the (noise-induced) cellular heterogeneity of the gut non-stem progenitor pool. Computational analysis facilitates discovery of putative premalignant populations, which are then isolated using surface markers and tested for ability to form intestinal organoids in vitro and tumors in vivo upon colonic orthotopic transplantation. The second part of the project will use CRISPR genetic screening to dissect and model the molecular 'circuit' driving tumor growth arising from each identified cancer-initiating cell type, to reveal unique metabolic vulnerabilities connected with an individual's disease. Profiling the noise and heterogeneity associated with specific tumors therefore enables early discovery and elimination of cancer through patient-tailored synergistic drug-dietary interventions.

356    Dr Ismail Heba    University of Sheffield    2018-11-01    2023-10-31    Identifying a new treatment paradigm for osteoarthritis: targeting the ubiquitination machinery regulating inflammatory responses to injury    Osteoarthritis is a disease where joint destruction arises from maladaptive responses to repetitive tissue injury. Mechanical injury to articular cartilage results in chronic inflammation, pain and predisposes to tissue damage and loss of function. There is a pressing need for disease-modifying therapies for osteoarthritis. Identifying the cellular mechanisms regulating cellular responses to injury is crucial for understanding osteoarthritis and for designing specifically-tailored therapeutic regimens. Recently, I have discovered that injury to connective tissues including articular cartilage rapidly activates the formation of Lysine 63-polyubiquitin chains that induce downstream inflammatory cascades, highlighting the critical role of ubiquitination in regulating this mechanism. Ubiquitination is a multistep reaction to add ubiquitin linkages to a protein substrate. Eukaryotic cells contain a large number of ubiquitin enzymes and the key regulators driving injury responses are currently unknown. In this fellowship, my overarching aim is to identify a new way to treat osteoarthritis by targeting the injury-induced ubiquitination machinery. My objectives are therefore: 1) to define the injury ubiquitome, 2) to identify the key ubiquitin E3 ligases driving this mechanism and 3) to investigate whether targeting the injury-induced E3 ligases in vivo can protect against development/progression of osteoarthritis. Since a large number of enzymes are involved in regulating ubiquitination, it is necessary to use a model system in which high-throughput screening is possible using readily available molecular tools. Transparent transgenic zebrafish are well suited for such studies.

Genetic association studies have revealed 113 loci affecting the risk of developing AS, most of which lack functional explanations hindering their translation to patient benefits. More than half of the genes affecting the risk of developing AS are involved in T cells functions, suggesting the important role of T cells in the pathogenesis of AS. Through integration of GWAS, eQTL and transcriptome data, combined with functional validation of gene candidates regulating T cells in AS, this proposal focuses on identification of novel T cell therapeutic targets in AS. Methods: Gene candidates regulating T cell functions in AS will be identified through the integrated analysis of AS-associated genetic variations, CD4/CD8 eQTL, transcriptome of known AS-associated T cell subsets, transcriptome of CD4/CD8 from AS patients and healthy controls and single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) of T cells from blood, joint synovial fluid/tissue from AS patients. Prioritized gene candidates will be firstly validated by gene knockdown in primary T cells from AS patients and healthy controls. The validated genes will then undergo second validation through CRISPR-knockout or gene overexpression. For 1-2 validated genes, in-depth mechanistic studies in relevant T cell subtypes will be performed. Key pathways related to validated genes will be identified through RNA-seq experiments of gene-silenced or knockout primary cells and scRNA-seq data mentioned above. Key proteins in the pathways will then be determined and validated through gene knockdown or knockout and relevant cellular assays. Potential applications: Proposed study will be the first to systematically investigate disease-associated genetic variants for the genes regulating T cell functions in AS. Data generated will provide functional explanations for AS-associated genetic loci, promote the understanding the AS pathogenesis, and potentially identify novel therapeutic targets for treatment of AS and other related arthritis.

Primary Ca2+ entry pathways into cells are Ca2+-release activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels. The two key limiting molecular players of this pathway are the stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), embedded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Orai1, the Ca2+ channel in the cell membrane. In the present project, my team and I, Mag. Dr. Irene Frischauf, functionally evaluate the role of previously unknown, disease-related mutations of STIM1 in human Ca2+-homeostasis. Besides the important physiological functions of these proteins, growing evidence suggests a key role of CRAC channels in cancer development. STIM1 mutations evaluated here either derive from large-scale, human cancer-genomics data or from patients with tubular aggregate myopathy (TAM). Systematically, we screen for gain-of-function (GOF) STIM1 mutants using a Ca2+ imaging technique as well as an NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) reporter assay. Identified pre-activated STIM1 mutants, exhibiting altered Ca2+/NFAT signalling, are further functionally characterized by the whole-cell patch-clamp technique for their impact on selectivity and gating of CRAC channels which will also identify loss-of-function (LOF) mutations. In cooperation with the University of Nove Hrady (Prof. Rüdiger Ettrich, Academy of the Czech Republic), we perform molecular dynamics simulations with selected STIM1 mutants to signpost subsequent experiments focusing on possible structural rearrangements that occur in constitutively active proteins. As physiological STIM1 activation is tightly controlled by Ca2+, we specify domains necessary for Ca2+-dependent oligomerization in STIM1. Via a systematic crosslinking approach, crucial residues within STIM1 are revealed that undergo conformational rearrangements upon its activation. To investigate the STIM1 disease-related mutants in their respective environment, we take advantage of CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited, endogenous STIM1 proteins in specific cancer cell lines (in cooperation with Prof. Martin Pichler, Research Unit of Non-Coding RNA and Genome Editing, Medical University of Graz) and monitor Ca2+-signalling and the pathophysiological impact on NFAT/MITF (microphthalmia associated factor)/TFEB (transcription factor EB)-regulated gene-expression. The results of this project determine key mechanistic steps in the STIM1 activation cascade, resolve functional mechanisms for Ca2+ homeostasis in human cancer cells and pave the way for the development of anticancer targets.

362    Dr. FUCHS Peter    University of Vienna    2018-01-01    2021-06-30    Is epiplakin a true keratin chaperone?    Epiplakin is a member of a family of cytoskeletal linker proteins called plakins. It is characterized by an unusual structure comprising of 16 plakin repeat domains in mice, an expression restricted to epithelial tissues, and binding to intermediate filaments, which are the only binding partners identified so far. Epiplakin-deficient mice did not show any discernible phenotype, except for a slight acceleration of keratinocyte migration. Recently we could show that in several pancreas and liver stress models, epiplakin and keratin expression was upregulated in parallel. In addition, epiplakin-deficient mice suffered from aggravated injuries and their diseased organs contained larger amounts of keratin aggregates and exhibited increased soluble keratin levels. Similar phenotypes found in primary epiplakin-deficient hepatocytes could be rescued by treatment with a chemical chaperone. Our data provide strong evidence that epiplakin is a protective protein in stress situations when keratin expression is upregulated, probably by acting as keratin organizer preventing formation of harmful keratin aggregates in a chaperone-like manner. In this project, we want to further elucidate these proposed functions of epiplakin in simple epithelia by performing a combination of approaches using mutant mouse lines, advanced bio-optical analyses of cultured cells, and biochemical methods. For the mouse work we plan to generate several double transgenic lines to investigate whether keratin expression levels are crucial for phenotypes observed in epiplakin-deficient mice. For the bio-optical part, the main goal is to tag full length epiplakin and keratins with fluorophores to monitor their subcellular localization and dynamics in living cells. In addition, in-vitro interaction studies will be performed with full-length epiplakin and keratins. For all these experiments we will use advanced techniques including the CrispR/Cas9 technology which enables the insertion of tags in the genome of cell lines. This project will be mainly executed by two PhD students and supported by our collaboration partners Rudolf Leube, Pavel Strnad, Gerhard Wiche, and Bishr Omary, who will provide tools and technical expertise. With this team, I expect to be able to reveal how epiplakin fulfils its proposed keratin-chaperoning functions. Epiplakin could finally turn out to be a keratin-interacting protein which is exerting core functions in the keratin cycle, in particular when filament turn-over is upregulated in stressed tissues. Such data would increase our knowledge about the mechanisms responsible for the in vivo assembly, disassembly, network organization, and dynamics of keratins, which are to date not as well understood as those for actin filaments and microtubules. Though until now no human epiplakin mutations causing pathologies were described, I expect that our findings will trigger and facilitate the search for patients showing such mutations, which could turn out to be disease modifiers or risk factors for the establishment of pathologies like chronic diseases of the gastrointestinal tract.

367    Mr Farrier Adam    TEL AVIV UNIVERSITY    2013-12-01    2018-12-01    Novel roles, components, and mechanisms of the Escherichia coli CRISPR/Cas system    A novel type of defense system was recently identified in bacteria: the CRISPR array and its associated gene products (Cas). The system inserts short DNA sequences, called spacers, derived from foreign nucleic acid molecules in between direct repeats, thus forming the CRISPR array. The transcribed spacers eventually serve as molecular guides for Cas proteins that monitor and destroy nucleic acids having sequences similar to those spacers. Thorough mapping of the functional components and regulators of the system in a single model organism will be extremely valuable for understanding its mechanism of action. Studying the interactions between bacteria and phages should highlight the evolutionary role of the system and its consequences for shaping ecological systems. These insights will lead to novel ways of exploiting the system to improve molecular biology tools, to protect fermenting bacteria from phage spoilage, to equip phages with anti-CRISPR warfare to fight bacteria, and to prevent horizontal gene transfer between pathogens. Here, I intend to systematically seek out new roles of the system and to identify fundamental mechanisms and components that allow the system to function efficiently. I will address fundamental questions such as how the system avoids sampling self DNA into the CRISPR array. In addition, I will pursue two revolutionary possibilities. One, that the CRISPR/Cas system is not merely an adaptive defense system against phages, but that one of its roles is to serve as molecular machinery for silencing specific harmful genes by generating small silencing RNAs without the need for Cas proteins. The other is to test the system's ability to prevent horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance genes in an effort to study the system's ecological value, potentially for applicative uses. My proposed studies will allow deeper understanding of the system, and enable breakthroughs from both basic and applicative aspects of the CRISPR field studies.

368    Mr Farrier Adam    Universität Zürich    2013-11-01    2018-11-01    Structural and mechanistic studies of RNA-guided and RNA-targeting antiviral defense pathways    The evolutionary pressures exerted by viruses on their host cells constitute a major force that drives the evolution of cellular antiviral mechanisms. The proposed research is motivated by our interest in the roles of protein-RNA interactions in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic antiviral pathways and will proceed in two directions. The first project stems from our current work on the CRISPR pathway, a recently discovered RNA-guided adaptive defense mechanism in bacteria and archaea that silences mobile genetic elements such as viruses (bacteriophages) and plasmids. CRISPR systems rely on short RNAs (crRNAs) that associate with CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins and function as sequence-specific guides in the detection and destruction of invading nucleic acids. To obtain molecular insights into the mechanisms of crRNA-guided interference, we will pursue structural and functional studies of DNA-targeting ribonuceoprotein complexes from type II and III CRISPR systems. Our work will shed light on the function of these systems in microbial pathogenesis and provide a framework for the informed engineering of RNA-guided gene targeting technologies. The second proposed research direction centres on RNA-targeting antiviral strategies employed by the human innate immune system. Here, our work will focus on structural studies of major interferon-induced effector proteins, examining the allosteric activation mechanism of RNase L and the mechanism of the IFIT protein complex that specifically targets 5'-termini of viral RNAs. In our investigations, we plan to approach these questions using an integrated strategy combining structural biology, biochemistry and biophysics with cell-based functional studies. Together, our studies will provide fundamental molecular insights into RNA-centred antiviral mechanisms and their impact on human health and disease.

369    Mr Farrier Adam    The Francis Crick Institute    2015-02-01    2017-01-31    Identification of Epigenetic Mechanisms regulating Cancer Stem Cell Formation and Function    Background Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been implicated in the maintenance of various types of cancer and promise to be critical therapeutic targets. Characterization of the molecular mechanisms regulating CSC function is crucial to develop CSC-targeted therapies. Yet, due to the difficulty of isolating pure CSC populations and manipulating them ex vivo, our understanding of their biological properties is still limited. We have recently overcome these limitations by developing a method for the generation of human cells with functional hallmarks of CSCs through oncogenic reprogramming of somatic cells in vitro. Being controlled and amenable to experimental manipulation, this system represents a unique tool to study CSC biology. We will use in vitro-generated CSCs to perform CRISPR/Cas-based loss-of-function screens, with the aim of discovering novel mechanisms important for CSC formation and function. This study has the potential to identify novel biomarkers and new molecular targets for cancer therapies. Aims and Methods 1. Generation of a fluorescent CSC reporter. In order to monitor the phenotype of tumorigenic CSCs in living, unstained cells, we will generate a dual-color CSC fluorescent reporter, taking advantage of genes which are strongly up- or down-regulated in in vitro-generated CSCs and correlate with tumorigenic potential. 2. Primary screening. CSCs or partially-reprogrammed precursor cell lines expressing the fluorescent reporters will be used in two distinct CRISPR/Cas loss-of-function screens using available pooled gRNA libraries. In the first screen we will use the partially reprogrammed cells and screen for gRNAs which promote CSC appearance, to identify tumor suppressors. In the second screen, we will use the CSCs and screen for gRNAs which inhibit their tumorigenicity, to discover novel therapeutic targets. 3. Hit validation. To rule out off-target effects, primary hits will be validated using distinct gRNAs, and by performing rescue experiments. As a final read–out, in vivo xenograft assays will be used to assess cell tumor-initiating ability. How the results of this research will be used Based on preliminary results, we expect to identify numerous proteins affecting CSC formation and function. Priority for validation in clinically-derived CSCs will be assigned based on various criteria: correlation between gene expression profiles and clinical outcome using publicly available datasets, existence of reported mutations, single cell analysis on tumor sections, target druggability and availability of tool compounds. Follow-up drug screening will be performed using the same experimental system and read-outs. The prognostic value of the identified hits will also be analyzed.

This project will determine the structural properties and drug-binding potential of two regions of the viral RNA essential for invasion and propagation of the COVID-19 genome in host cells: genes responsible for making spike and fusion proteins. Specifically, the project will develop new and efficient graph-theory based computational algorithms for identifying subregions in the COVID-19 viral genome that alter the RNA substructure when they are mutated. Identification of these subregions will aid in the discovery of anti-viral inhibitor compounds. Graph theory tools already developed in the PI?s lab offer coarse-grained approaches for RNA structural analysis and design. The PI will combine these tools with biomolecular modeling to examine the therapeutic potential of anti-viral inhibitors known from SARS, MERS, and other viruses. This project will produce structural insights into the RNA viral regions and identify critical nucleotides and candidate inhibitors that will help make progress against COVID-19. The research has profound impact to COVID-19 as well as other coronaviruses that could emerge in the future. The project offers unique interdisciplinary training in mathematics, biology, chemistry, and scientific computing for young scientists, including women and minorities. The research results will be shared rapidly with the COVID-19 research community at large.<br/><br/>RNA-targeting approaches have therapeutic potential due to the high sequence and structure conservation of the viral genomes and the rapid emergence of CRISPR technology. They also present alternatives when protein-inhibiting compounds lead to invasion of the RNA viral genome itself. Such compounds that alter the RNA structure significantly are expected to inhibit viral invasion and replication. Because the fusion-protein coding region contains a pseudoknot (intertwined base-pair) substructure involved in a frame-shifting mechanism, the determination of critical mutation regions and associated compounds that destroy this pseudoknot will be invaluable. The project team has rich experience in biomolecular modeling and simulation of nucleic acid complexes and has developed a graph-theory framework for analyzing RNA motifs, predicting structures, and designing novel RNA folds. The graph-theory framework will be extended and applied in this project to address the COVID-19 pandemic by determining key regions in the RNA COVID-19 viral genome and associated chemical inhibitors that would interfere with viral fusion into and replication within host cells.

373    Professor Dion Vincent    Cardiff University    2020-01-01    2023-01-01    AMS Professorship Award for Professor Vincent Dion, Cardiff University    There is currently no disease modifying treatment for any of the expanded CAG/CTG repeat disorders. Our goal is to remedy this. We identified two attractive single use therapeutic options to treat these disorders. One is to contract the repeat tract, the other is to silence the expression of the expanded allele. Current approaches using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are working their way to the clinic; CRISPR-based ones are not far behind. Unfortunately, such treatments target both the mutant and normal alleles. Indeed, in 13 of the 14 expanded CAG/CTG repeat disorders, patients are heterozygotes. The normal allele often performs important functions and it should remain untouched. Moreover, the ASO-based approaches must be administered continually throughout the individual’s lifetime, creating a significant burden on their quality of life. We have recently shown that gene editing can be allele-length specific by using the CRISPR-Cas9 nickase. Such a treatment would correct the cause of these diseases permanently. Here, we aim to identify novel factors that can be harnessed to silence expanded CAG/CTG repeats specifically, independently of disease locus. We will thereby open the way for new therapeutic options for all expanded CAG/CTG diseases. We will use a variety of novel high throughput screening approaches in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from patients. We will collaborate with the Medicine Discovery Institute at Cardiff University, which develops drugs against cancer and neurological diseases. Our CRISPR-based approach is highly promising, and the next step is to establish that the frequency of off target mutations is low enough to move into the clinic. This is a challenging issue since the current methods for measuring CRISPR-mediated off-targets are suitable neither for detecting nicks nor for monitoring changes in repeat size. Here we aim to use Huntington disease as a model system to develop a new method of identifying off target mutations using single-cell sequencing. For all projects running in my lab, a major challenge is to obtain bespoke bioinformatics support. Arguably, the best way of doing so is to embed a computational biologist into my research group. This will allow lab members to exchange ideas, leading to better experimental design and more efficient analysis methods. The AMS professorship supporting such a post would provide a major boost to every project in my lab. Furthermore, I could support a postdoc for two years with the aim to obtain a postdoctoral fellowship and become successful in his/her own rights. This is a critical time for me as I establish my lab in a new country. My approach to this is two fold. First, I plan to acquire competitive funding. Second, I aim to grow a national network. The AMS professorship would be especially helpful for both of these goals. The funding it provides would give me time to gather preliminary data and successfully obtain funding from major funders, including the MRC and the Wellcome Trust. In addition, the AMS career development events would help me tremendously towards building a new network of collaborators.

374    Professor Rass Ulrich    University of Sussex    2020-01-01    2023-07-31    AMS Professorship Award for Professor Ulrich Rass, University of Sussex    After a PhD at the University of Cologne and postdoctoral work at Clare Hall with Steve West (CRUK) on mechanisms of DNA break repair and links to premature ageing, neurodegeneration, and cancer, I have set up my own research programme as Junior Group Leader at the Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research (FMI) in Basel. Following my recent move to the Genome Damage and Stability Centre, I am looking to establish research lines in chromosome maintenance and replication in the UK. This is supported by University of Sussex start-up funding, ensuring continuity of ongoing basic research projects. Funding from the AMS Professorship Scheme would provide the opportunity to bridge the gap between basic and translational research, allowing me to pursue a two-pronged approach to understand the cellular responses to replication stress on a molecular level, and test whether the enzymes involved can be suitable anti-cancer targets. Inherent replication stress sensitizes cancer cells to interference with DNA repair and replication fork maintenance, providing a potential point of therapeutic intervention. Our discovery of the Dna2-Yen1 axis has provided a handle on the ill-defined processes occurring at perturbed replication forks. We will explore the molecular space surrounding Dna2-Yen1/GEN1 using molecular genetics, analyses of DNA structures and replication intermediates, and by investigating downstream events re-establishing chromosome integrity following nucleolytic sister-chromatid separation in mitosis. We have already identified additional activities of the Dna2-Yen1 pathway, suggesting active processing of the leading and lagging strands, consistent with extensive replication fork remodelling. These insights have inspired my aspiration to move into translational studies using a pathophysiologically-relevant MCF10A-based HER2-DELTA-dirven breast cancer model. HER2-DELTA cells grow in 2D, as 3D organoids, and give rise to tumours in mice. Our unpublished results show significant attenuation of cancer-cell growth upon CRISPR-Cas9-mediated DNA2 point mutations (abrogating its nuclease or helicase activities) or knock-out of the MUS81 nuclease (which shares functions with GEN1). Excitingly, MUS81 and DNA2 mutations abolished tumour-uptake in mice (with Prof. Bentires-Alj, University-Hospital Basel), which is consistent with the hypothesis that cancer cells develop a non-oncogenic addiction to key effectors of the replication stress response and promising for therapeutic exploitation. We want to build on these results, harnessing mechanistic insight into DNA metabolism in the search for effective cancer treatments, which remains a major health issue. Mechanistically, we will establish the mechanisms of cell death upon DNA2-GEN1 and MUS81 abrogation in cancer cells. Translationally, our primary goal is to provide proof-of-principle that effector-level inhibition of the replication stress response will be a feasible anti-cancer strategy in future. Support by the Academy of Medical Sciences Professorship Scheme will be critical to implement this translational arm of our research in the UK and to pursue our ambitious strategy of marrying research into fundamental chromosome maintenance processes with direct assessment of novel insight for impact in disease settings. Since replication stress is widespread in cancers, exploiting replication stress for targeted therapy is not tied to a particular cancer type, giving our findings far-reaching relevance.

377    Dr Koumanov Francoise    University of Bath    2019-09-01    2020-08-31    Interrogating the role of retriever sorting complex in adipose insulin-sensitivity and GLUT4 recycling    The aim is to understand the mechanisms underlying the defects in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 trafficking that lead to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. GLUT4 traffics through multiple compartments to reach specialised storage vesicles (GSV) from where it can be recruited to the plasma membrane upon insulin stimulation. Trafficking events involving sorting GLUT4 and other cargo proteins from a late endosomal compartment back into the recycling pool are essential for the formation of the GSV. Retromer and the newly discovered retriever complexes play a role in late-endosomal sorting. In this study, we propose to explore the potential role of the retriever complex in GSV formation. We have generated clonal knockout 3T3-L1 cell lines, using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, lacking Vps29 (common to both retromer and retriever complexes), Vps35 (unique to retromer) and Vps35L/C16orf62 (unique to retriever). We have confirmed the knockout status of the clones, performed some preliminary analysis and will further characterise them to determine phenotype in the absence of these proteins. Using a range of cell-biology and biochemistry techniques, we will determine for the first time whether the retriever complex affects GLUT4 sorting to GSVs and its translocation to the plasma membrane in response to insulin stimulation and facilitate glucose uptake.

379    Univ.-Prof ZOTCHEV Sergey    University of Vienna    2019-11-01    2023-10-31    Novel bacterial metabolites via synthetic biology    Wider research context: Bacterial secondary metabolites represent a treasure trove for drug discovery (e.g. antibiotics, anti-cancer and immunomodulating agents etc), and provide new insight into the natural product biosynthesis. However, many bacteria harbor secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters (BGCs) that are not expressed under laboratory conditions, and thus their products cannot be purified and characterized. Synthetic biology is a new scientific discipline that applies engineering principles to biological systems with the aim of improving them or building novel ones. Synthetic biology approaches can be used to re-engineer (refactor) silent biosynthetic genes in such a way, that they can be expressed in heterologous hosts, leading to production of previously undiscovered secondary metabolites. Research question and objectives: SynBioBac project intends to address the challenge of “waking” silent biosynthetic genes in bacteria by using synthetic biology principles and tools. Correspondingly, the objectives include cloning of selected BGCs, their disassembly and refactoring with new regulatory elements, development of tools for activation of gene expression and sensing of produced secondary metabolites, expression of refactored BGCs in several heterologous bacterial hosts, followed by purification and characterization of novel secondary metabolites. Methods: Construction of representative gene libraries followed by screening; assembly of complete BGCs in yeast (transformation-associated recombination); BGCs disassembly using a combination of PCR and restriction digests; refactoring in yeast with new regulatory elements with help of CRISPR/Cas system; construction of activator and biosensor devices; expression in pre-engineered bacterial hosts; identification of metabolites with high-resolution mass spectrometry; purification and structure elucidation with NMR; testing for biological activities. Level of originality: The project goes well beyond current state-of-the-art, since it develops and tests an original synthetic biology-based approach to “waking” silent bacterial genes for biosynthesis of secondary metabolites.

386    Dr. ENGLINGER Bernhard    Medical University of Vienna    2019-04-01    2021-03-31    Single-cell RNA-sequencing of pediatric ependymoma    Scientific background and hypothesis of the project: Pediatric ependymoma constitutes a heterogeneous set of tumors affecting the neuroepithelial linings of the entire central nervous system. Especially high-grade subtypes are frequently refractory to chemotherapy and lead to poor overall outcomes for patients. Genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic profiling has revealed distinct molecular subgroups associated with high tumor aggressiveness, most frequently arising in children and adolescents. However, besides few exceptions, targetable oncogenic driver mutations and pathways still remain unidentified and molecular insights into ependymoma biology have yet resulted in only little progress in the clinical management of this disease. Thus, novel targets for systemic treatment of ependymoma urgently need to be identified. However, this endeavor is complicated by the rarity of this disease, its genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity, as well as the low abundance of recurrent genetic mutations, even in those subtypes exhibiting poor prognosis. One major shortcoming of the field is that the majority of current large-scale profiling is performed on bulk tumor tissue, obscuring its heterogenic make-up at single-cell level with regard to mutations/programs orchestrating key oncogenic proliferation, self-renewal, invasion, and chemo-resistance traits. Scientific innovation and originality of the proposed project: This project aims to interrogate the cellular architecture and the interplay between genetic mutations and transcriptional programs of ependymoma at unprecedented resolution, using single-cell transcriptomics. The leading expertise in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) in the applicant’s receiving institution will be leveraged to analyze single cells from fresh surgical specimen of the major molecular ependymoma subgroups. Matched patient-derived cell models will be used to functionally test putative targetable driver alterations identified by scRNA-seq, employing pharmacological or genome-editing technologies. Successful completion of this project will provide insight into ependymoma pathogenesis and to reveal novel oncogenic driver alterations of this disease at a resolution not achievable by conventional bulk tissue characterization. These insights are expected to catalyze the discovery of novel molecular targets for systemic ependymoma treatment to improve clinical management of this pediatric malignancy. Methods: Patient tumor specimen will be prepared and sorted as single-cell suspensions for full-length, whole-transcriptome scRNA-seq. Computational analysis tools will be used for bioinformatic work-up of intratumoral heterogeneity and to compare single-cell- with bulk tumor transcriptome/genomic- data. In vitro cultures of matched patient-derived cell models will be tested by pharmacological and CRISPR-Cas9-directed gene editing intervention. Primary responsible researchers of the project: Bernhard Englinger, PhD, the project applicant, will be the principal person conducting the proposed project. Mariella Filbin, MD, PhD, will be the project supervisor at the receiving institution (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston). Johannes Gojo, MD, PhD, at Medical University of Vienna will be the main collaborator coordinating the sharing of Vienna-originating patient material.

While some of the molecular determinants for cell fate specification have been identified, a fundamental understanding of which genetic activities are required in each cell of a developing tissue is still outstanding. The DECODE project will develop and apply leading-edge system genetics methods to Arabidopsis and Drosophila, two major model systems from the plant and animal kingdoms to decode context-dependent genetic networks in vivo. To achieve this, DECODE will bring together experimental and theoretical groups with complementary expertise in model organism genetics and cellular phenotyping, single-cell genomics, statistics and computational biology. Building on our combined expertise, we will create functional genetic maps using conditional CRISPR/Cas9-based single- and higher order knockout perturbations in vivo combined with single-cell expression profiling and imaging. Coupled with powerful computational analysis, this project will not only define, predict and rigorously test the unique genetic repertoire of each cell, but also unravel how genetic networks adapt their topology and function across cell types and external stimuli. With more than thousand conditional knockouts, characterized by several million single-cell transcriptome profiles and high-resolution imaging this project will create the largest single-cell perturbation map in any model organism and will provide fundamental insights into the genetic architecture of complex tissues. Analyzing two tissues with divergent organization and regulatory repertoire will enable us to uncover general principles in the genetic circuits controlling context dependent cell behavior. Consequently, we expect that the DECODE project in model organisms will lay the conceptual and methodological foundation for perturbation-based functional atlases in other tissues or species.

This ERC project proposes a novel crossing scheme that allows for an expeditious evaluation of combinations of potential yield contributing alleles by unifying ‘classical’ breeding with gene-centric molecular biology. The acronym BREEDIT, a word fusion of breeding and editing, reflects the basic concept of combining breeding with multiplex genome editing of yield related genes. By introducing plants with distinct combinations of genome edited mutations in more than 80 known yield related genes into a crossing scheme, the combinatorial effect of these mutations on plant growth and yield will be evaluated. Subsequent rounds of crossings will increase the number of stacked gene-edits per plant, thus increasing the combinatorial complexity. Phenotypic evaluations throughout plant development will be done on our in-house automated image-analysis based phenotyping platform. The nature and frequency of Cas9-mediated mutations in the entire plant collection will be characterised by multiplex amplicon sequencing to follow the efficiency of CRISPR-cas9 genome editing and to identify the underlying combinations of genes that cause beneficial phenotypes (genetic gain). The obtained knowledge on yield regulatory networks can be directly implemented into current molecular breeding programs and the project will provide the basis to develop targeted breeding schemes implementing the optimal combinations of beneficial alleles into elite material. BREEDIT will be a major step forward in integrating basic knowledge on genes with plant breeding and has the potential to provoke a paradigm shift in improving crop yield.

Lengthening or shortening of the cell cycle is a fundamental disease mechanism in development, ageing and cancer. It is likely that many developmental diseases are caused at least in large part by early defects of cell proliferation and many studies are now using mouse models of these conditions to explore this hypothesis in numerous systems. Mouse cell cycle kinetics are often investigated using thymidine analogues such as BrdU - incorporated into DNA during S-phase. These techniques rely on multiple injections or the surgical implantation of mini osmotic pumps to deliver the analogue. Recently, genetically encoded cell cycle probes have been developed and these are key to refining proliferation assays because they can be combined with live-imaging efficiently generating large datasets from fewer animals. Of these, the best existing model is the R26Fucci2aR (developed by RLM) reporter model because of the 1:1 stoichiometry of probe expression and the ability to control expression spatio-temporally with Cre-recombinase. However a number of shortcomings still exist: 1) It does not discriminate S-phase from G2/M-phases; 2) It does not discriminate G1 from quiescent cells in G0. 3) The probes are technically difficult to detect with antibodies limiting them to live studies. In order to address these shortcomings we will develop a next generation Quiescence and Cell Cycle Indicator (QuCCI) and Rosa26 QuCCi knock-in reporter mouse. QuCCi incorporates the the tried and tested probes p27K-,hCdt1(Cy-) and hGem(1/110) fused to mCerulean, mCherry and mVenus respectively including unique epitope tags.

395    Dr Ababneh Nidaa    University of Jordan    2019-09-27    2019-10-27    Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and CRISPR-based genetic engineering for the study of neuromuscular disorders    Induced pluripotent stem cell technology offers unique advantages in modeling of rare diseases. Multiple studies have demonstrated that iPSCs carrying patient-specific mutations can recapitulate functional and cellular phenotypes observed in patients. In addition to modeling of the pathogenesis and functional deficits in rare diseases, advances in iPSC technology have potentially broad applications in drug discovery, toxicity testing, and developing novel drug screening platforms. Genomic editing to correct disease-causing mutations is a promising approach for the treatment of human diseases. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system has substantially improved the ability to make precise changes in the human genome. Combining iPSC technology with CRISPR system has provided the ability to repair mutated causative alleles in patient lines, or to introduce disease alleles into a healthy “WT” cell line. This has enabled analysis of isogenic cell pairs that differ in a single genetic change, which allows a precise assessment of the molecular and cellular phenotypes underlying this abnormality under the same genetic background. These isogenic cell lines can be used not only to understand the cellular consequences of disease mutations, but also to perform high throughput drug screens to both understand the underlying pathological mechanisms and to develop novel therapeutic agents to prevent or treat diseases. In this work, we plan to combine iPSC and genome editing technology for understanding molecular disease mechanisms of rare hereditary neuromuscular diseases. We will use patient-derived iPSCs to model neurological hereditary diseases. Using the latest CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we will introduce precise modifications into the genome of our patient-derived iPSCs and we need to produce the transfer viral vectors to modulate the expression of target gene in neuronal cell. Following genome editing, we will differentiate both unmodified and modified iPSC lines into disease-relevant cell types, such as cortical and motor neurons to study the underlying disease pathways. My visit will mainly involve an extensive training on the preparation of viral based gene transfer systems for research and therapy applications in neuromuscular diseases. Azzouz’s lab has extensive experience and track record in neurodegeneration research and collaborating with his group would be a great opportunity for us to develop our research plans. We expect that the collaboration would make a significant contribution to our research background. In particular, their broad experience in the generation of viral vectors to modulate the expression of target gene in neuronal cells, and studying DNA instability in patient derived neurons. This would help us to better understanding of the underlying disease phenotypes and to establish new therapeutic strategies and developing new drug screening platforms.

Despite their prevalence, the concrete functional roles of these alterations are not well understood, for two reasons: First, cancer samples tend to carry many correlated epigenetic alterations, making it difficult to statistically distinguish relevant driver events from those that co-occur for other reasons. Second, we lack tools for targeted epigenome editing that could be used to validate biological function in perturbation and rescue experiments. The proposed project strives to overcome these limitations through experimental and bioinformatic methods development, with the ambition of making and breaking cancer cells in vitro by introducing defined sets of epigenetic alterations. We will focus on leukemia as our “model cancer” (given its low mutation rate, frequent defects in epigenetic regulators, and availability of excellent functional assays), but the concepts and methods are general. In Aim 1, we will generate epigenome profiles for a human knockout cell collection comprising 100 epigenetic regulators and use the data to functionally annotate thousands of epigenetic alterations observed in large cancer datasets. In Aim 2, we will develop an experimental toolbox for epigenome programming using epigenetic drugs, CRISPR-assisted recruitment of epigenetic modifiers for locus-specific editing, and cell-derived guide RNA libraries for epigenome copying. Finally, in Aim 3 we will explore epigenome programming (methods from Aim 2) of candidate driver events (predictions from Aim 1) with the ultimate goal of converting cancer cells into non-cancer cells and vice versa. In summary, this project will establish a broadly applicable methodology and toolbox for dissecting the functional roles of epigenetic alterations in cancer. Moreover, successful creation of a cancer that is driven purely by epigenetic alterations could challenge our understanding of cancer as a genetic disease.

399    Dr Sampson Stephen    University of Zurich    2014-03-01    2018-02-28    Molecular mechanisms of RNA-guided DNases from prokaryotic adaptive immune systems    In all domains of life, viruses and mobile genetic elements have driven the evolution of genome defence mechanisms. It has recently been shown that bacteria and archaea acquire heritable resistance against bacteriophages and plasmids by incorporating short fragments of foreign nucleic acids into genomic clusters of regular interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) loci. These adaptive immune systems rely on short RNAs (crRNAs) that associate with CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins in large ribonucleoprotein surveillance complexes, in which they mediate sequence-specific detection and destruction of invading nucleic acids. Although the function of CRISPR systems is understood in broad terms, the molecular mechanisms of CRISPR interference remain elusive. To obtain molecular insights into the mechanisms underlying crRNA-guided targeting and elimination of foreign nucleic acids, we propose to pursue structural and functional studies of DNA-targeting crRNA-Cas ribonucleoprotein complexes found in several CRISPR system subtypes. In this project, a multidisciplinary approach combining biochemistry, X-ray crystallography and complementary structural approaches with functional assays in vitro and in vivo will allow us to obtain a comprehensive picture of the interference steps in CRISPR pathways. Together, the proposed studies will make a timely contribution to our understanding of RNA-guided genome defence. The DNA-targeting CRISPR systems are found in numerous human pathogens, in which they not only provide phage defence but also counteract the acquisition of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes by horizontal gene transfer. Our future work will thus shed light on the function of these systems in bacterial pathogenesis. In addition to their significance in prokaryotic RNA biology, crRNA-guided DNases have emerged as promising molecular tools for site-specific RNA-guided gene targeting. The proposed structural investigations of RNA-guided CRISPR DNases will provide a mechanistic framework for the continued development of RNA-based genetic engineering technologies.

403    Dr Hall Nikki    University of Geneva    2016-07-01    2019-06-30    Monogenic diabetes: Integrating genetic screening with functional clinical biology    BACKGROUND: Monogenic diabetes represents a heterogeneous group of disorders resulting from defects in single genes. Defects are categorized primarily into three groups: developmental defects with a reduced number of beta cells, disruption of beta cell function or a progressive destruction of beta cells, mostly by defects in key regulators of autoimmunity. With the support of the SNF (Interdisciplinary grant CR33I3_140655) we have built a Swiss and international cohort of over 400 diabetic subjects, who are all genetically characterized (targeted next generation sequences, whole exome in selected cases). The approach by next generation sequencing yielded a high diagnostic rate of monogenic diabetes (MD) in 28% of the subjects, where we identi-fied known mutations and novel variants in the so called MODY genes (HNF4A, GCK, HNF1A, PDX1, HNF1B, NEUROD1, KLF11, CEL, PAX4, INS, BLK, ABCC8, KCNJ11). Confirming our ini-tial hypothesis that mutations in all genes controlling pancreas development and beta cell function could cause MD, we identified variants in additional 23% of the subjects of our cohort in 88 different genes (including KIAA2022). Based on these encouraging results we now propose the following hy-pothesis and related aims:PROJECT RATIONALE: In addition to the previous rational, we now extend our hypothesis to regulatory elements in noncod-ing regions contribute to the complex human diabetes phenotype in our cohort. We therefore propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: To investigate the unidentified families with a high probability of MD by whole genome sequencing, assess allele specific expression (ASE) and search for modifiers by RNA-Sequencing in the whole cohort. We will follow up on our cohort built with the previous grant and use cutting edge human genetics such as whole genome sequencing and RNA-Sequencing to investigate the complex mechanisms of diabetes. Aim 2: To functionally analyze newly identified genes involved in MD in vitro and in vivo by gen-erating a knockout mouse using the CRISPR-Cas9 technique.EXPECTED VALUE: We believe that our hypothesis is most efficiently tested with an interdisci-plinary approach, combining clinical endocrinology, human genetics and cell biology. Our results will help improve our understanding of the genetics and pathophysiology of underlying diabetes. If successful, we will not only extend the list of genes and noncoding regions causing MD but also provide insight into the physiology in human beta cell function. These results may help to identify novel targets to efficiently treat MD to prevent long-term complications in affected children. Moreover, the mechanistic insight may also serve to expand the therapeutic approaches to polygenic forms of diabetes. As proof of principle the results collected during the last funding period have led to critical adjustments of treatment for those participants who were initially misdiagnosed, improving their quality of life and hopefully prevention of long-term complications.

404    Dr Hall Nikki    Other Research Institutes    2017-09-01    2021-08-31    Host innate immune responses to viral RNA    'Host innate immune responses to viral RNA'Background: Coronaviruses (CoVs) are RNA viruses that have long been known to cause severe disease in livestock and companion animals. In humans, severe and fatal respiratory diseases have been observed through the emergence of zoonotic CoVs, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. CoVs are well known to efficiently evade early innate immune responses and enzymatic functions within - and virus-host interactions at - the CoV replication/transcription complex (RTC) are key to efficiently evade early innate immune responses. Working hypothesis and aims: We hypothesize that induction of early innate immune responses to CoV heavily rely on the ability of host cell innate immune sensors to access and recognize viral RNA and that CoVs have evolved efficacious mechanisms to prevent early detection of viral RNA. We further hypothesize that these early virus-host interactions predominantly take place at the CoV RTC. In order to mechanistically understand these innate immune evasion strategies, we will “illuminate” the cellular environment of the CoV RTC to identify host cell factors that are required for CoV replication, and host cell factors that are targeting the CoV RTC to restrict CoV replication. The reverse genetic systems for the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and well characterized recombinant mutant viruses will be used in combination with murine and human models of infection to dissect key steps and key molecules involved in early innate immune responses on the molecular level. We will furthermore employ state-of-the-art technologies involving biotin ligase-mediated proximity labeling and proteomics, CRISPR/Cas9-based functional screens, and transcriptomics in combination with ribosomal profiling to obtain a detailed mechanistic view on (i) key interactions involved in early innate immune responses, (ii) the kinetics of these interactions and (iii) the kinetics of the global host cell response under well-defined conditions. These studies will provide spatial and temporal view of basic principles of viral RNA recognition and antiviral innate immune mechanisms in different primary cell types following virus infection. Expected significance: Our proposed studies will reveal basic principles of viral RNA sensing and antiviral innate immune effector mechanisms that are highly relevant also beyond CoV infections. We expect to identify key molecules, mechanisms and pathways that promote or restrict viral replication at the site of viral RNA synthesis. This information will further our understanding on fundamental aspects of viral RNA synthesis and innate immune responses to RNA virus infection, and will facilitate the development of novel strategies to interfere with viral RNA replication during the early phase of infections.

Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignancy in women, with an incidence of one in eight being affected within their lifetime. This emphasizes the need to improve breast cancer prevention and treatment. Breast carcinomas are divided into several clinical subtypes. Among these is invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), which is characterized by neoplastic mammary cells invading the surrounding stroma in a dispersed, discohesive growth pattern. This phenotype is based on dysfunctional cell-cell adhesion, primarily driven by lack of E-cadherin (CDH1) protein expression. Consequently, most ILCs display loss-of-function alterations of the CDH1 locus. Although several recurrent genetic alterations have been identified in human ILC, only a few of these genes have been functionally studied in mice in the context of Cdh1 loss. Hence, more systematic approaches are required to functionally and comprehensively decipher the molecular processes of ILC initiation and metastatic progression.Prof. Jonkers’ laboratory at the Netherlands Cancer Institute - Antoni van Leeuwenhoek hospital (NKI- AVL), has demonstrated considerable expertise in modeling breast cancer using 3D organotypic cultures and diverse genetically engineered mouse models. Moreover, a recently introduced culture method has enabled 2D in vitro propagation of primary murine mammary epithelial cells (MMECs). To this end, MMEC cultures derived from wild-type or Cdh1-floxed mice will serve as platform to conduct CRISPR/Cas9-based, genome-wide screening approaches. Candidate genes promoting MMEC proliferation in conjunction with Cdh1 loss will be further evaluated in a rapid, non-germline CRISPR/Cas9-dependent mouse model of ILC. Of note, the MMEC culture system will also be instrumental to expand and functionally study human primary cells derived from ILCs and corresponding precursor-type lesions. This will complement the data arising from murine ILC-modeling, thus ultimately unraveling novel drivers of human ILC. Taken together, these findings will deepen the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of ILC and may have substantial translational impact on breast cancer prognosis and therapy.

410    Dr. ATANASOVA Lea    University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna    2018-03-01    2023-04-30    NEW GMC OXIDOREDUCTASES FROM CLONOSTACHYS ROSEA    Enzymes from the glucose-methanol-choline family of flavin-dependent enzymes (GMC oxidoreductases) are often linked to enzymatic combustion, a mechanism of ligninolysis involving several non-specific oxidative enzymes. Such mechanisms have mostly been described in basidiomycetous brown rot and white rot fungi, but are largely unknown in non-ligninolytic Ascomycota. Clonostachys rosea (Hypocreales, Ascomycota) is a filamentous with a broad range of ecological specializations from plant associations, saprotrophy to biotrophy and parasitism on nematodes and other fungi. Upon sequencing of C. rosea genomes, the gene family encoding GMC oxidoreductases classified as auxiliary activity family 3 (CAZy classification), specifically subfamily AA3_2 (aryl alcohol and glucose oxidases), was found to be significantly expanded. On the other hand, the genomes of the saprotrophs Neurospora crassa and Trichoderma reesei as well as the mycoparasites Trichoderma atroviride and Trichoderma virens (ecologically very similar to C. rosea) showed a significantly reduced AA3 gene content, suggesting that such enzymes are not essential for these nutritional strategies, and were either not acquired or lost by selective adaptation. This poses the question about the function of this many C. rosea paralogs, as this fungus is neither a prominent lignocellulose decomposer nor a plant pathogen, that would demand such an arsenal of genes for (ligno)cellulose degradation. The aim of this study is to elucidate the functionality and role of C. rosea GMC oxidoreductases, and identify the nutritional strategies they are involved in. Our research plan includes a transcriptional study of GMC oxidoreductases that are significantly regulated under the C. rosea major nutritional conditions, an investigation of the functional significance of GMC oxidoreductases in C. rosea (including single/multiple inactivation of genes using state-of-the-art CRISPR/Cas9 engineering tools) and biochemical characterization of selected GMC oxidoreductases that encode functional enzymes. Our large-scale approach will provide important insights in the regulation of gene families supporting different life-styles in C. rosea and highlight complex mechanisms of mycoparasitism and fungus-plant interactions.

411    Dr Correia Martins Filipe    University of Cambridge    2017-02-01    2019-01-31    Genomic and functional characterization of PTEN loss as a driver event in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) - its implications for prognosis and therapeutic response    High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the commonest and a lethal form of ovarian cancer, characterized by profound heterogeneity, prevalent TP53 mutation and BRCA1/2. Identification of new driver pathways is critical to develop credible personalised treatments. PTEN suppresses the oncogenic PI3K pathway and regulates homologous recombination (HR) and consequently its loss can be targeted by inhibitors of the PI3K and DNA repair pathways. I have recently identified that PTEN loss or downregulation is common in HGSOC (present in 281 of 447 cases), occurs mainly by copy number alterations (CNA), is associated with worse prognosis and offers possibilities for personalized therapy. My hypothesis is that the effects of PTEN activity in HGSOC are dose-dependent and expression levels and cellular localization of PTEN determine functional differences. I aim to 1) model the functional effects of PTEN haploinsufficiency or loss in tumour cell lines; 2) test small molecule inhibitors from Astrazeneca in combinations targeting PI3K pathway and HR. In aim 1, I will analyse gene expression/pathways, HR, cellular localization of proteins and drug response in CRISPR transformed HGSOC lines. For aim 2, I will develop an ex-vivo model using tumour sections from primary tumours to validate potential therapeutic combinations from aim 1 in patient material. The translational impact of this work will be to use PTEN expression/dosage as a validated biomarker for routine clinical stratification in clinical trials targeting the PTEN pathway in HGSOC. I will also develop a model to predict therapeutic response and to validate new drug combinations in pre-clinical trials.    Cancer Research UK    CCC - Post Doctoral Research Bursary    402091.54EUR
412    Dr. COLE Alison    University of Vienna    2018-07-01    2022-06-30    Stem cells and cell type complexity in a sea anemone    The complexity of animal body plans can be approximated by the diversity of different cell types, yet how the observed cell type complexity has evolved and to what extent this is related to genetic complexity is one of the open fundamental questions in biology. Furthermore, how the cell types are maintained by stem cells throughout adulthood has important biomedical implications. Different from humans who age when their stem cells are depleted due to an imbalance between self-renewal and differentiation, simpler organisms, like cnidarians, continuously generate new cells from stem cells without any signs of senescence. However, the possible connection between cell type complexity, its evolution, and the non-senescent properties of stem cells in these organisms remain to be elucidated. In this project, we will identify and investigate the hitherto enigmatic stem cells and the full cell type diversity in a virtually immortal animal, the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. To this end, we will combine microfluidics-based single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), for unbiased molecular characterization of cell populations, with gene perturbation studies for assessing the functional roles of putative stem-cell marker genes. As a complementary approach, we will investigate the role of known genes commonly associated with the germline and pleuripotent stem cells. The identified candidate stem cells will be monitored by lineage tracing in transgenic animals to visualize their differentiation potential. We will test the function of the identified stem cell genes by gene knockdowns and in CRISPR/Cas9 mutants. The morphant embryos will be subjected to scRNA-seq to identify cell populations that are affected and hence, likely to be direct progenies of the stem cells. The molecular profiling will provide an objective and comprehensive basis for assessing the relationship between genetic and organismal complexity. Revealing the identity and molecular features of stem cells in this immortal animal will be key for our understanding of regenerative capacity and longevity.

Their efficient synthesis has remained a major challenge and the current limited access to these compounds severely impedes progress in modern research areas of RNA biology. The envisaged synthetic pathways also aim at increasing the structural diversity of cRNAs; this will be achieved by modifications concerning the phosphate backbone through formation of alternative internucleotide linkages (e.g. 2'-5'-, 5'-5'(3'-3')-phosphodiesters, phosphorothioates, triazoles linkages, amide linkages) and by insertion of distinct ribose modifications (e.g. 2'-OCH3, -F, -H, 2'-O–4'-C methylene (LNA monomers), 2'-tethers bearing reactive groups such as alkyne, vinyl, or amino groups). Importantly, in collaborative efforts with the team of Virginijus Siksnys, these novel cRNA derivatives will be tested for their potential as activators/inhibitors of CRISPR-associated (Cas) Csm6 ribonucleases, and additionally, in crystallographic studies aiming at a high resolution structure of the corresponding protein complexes. This cRNA–based signaling pathway has been discovered very recently and coordinates components of CRISPR-Cas to prevent phage infection and propagation. The research proposed here therefore aims at solving a fundamental scientific problem that links advanced synthetic bioorganic chemistry to highly topical research on CRISPR-Cas systems.

However, a large body of evidence infers the existence of a previous, more primitive biology in which RNA also stored information in cellular entities. Recreating a living cellular fossil representing this transition from an ancient RNA world to modern DNA-based life would fundamentally advance our understanding of our biology’s history, and enable us to explore its biological properties experimentally. However, the reengineering of existing molecular systems into a viable doppelganger of the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) or one of its precursors is extremely challenging. I propose to use a novel, combined top-down and bottom-up approach to create a modern-day doppelganger of LUCA by engineering bacterial hybrids with core cellular functions encoded on RNA. Using Darwinian Evolution as driver, my team and I will prototype and refine synthetic RNA-replicons through alternating replication in both cell-free and intracellular environments. This “dual evolution” approach will shape increasingly complex RNA networks capable of encoding complex genetic information. Following this, we will use these networks to create information-rich RNA chromosomes, enabling the transfer of essential genomic information from DNA to RNA. Finally, we will address this intergenomic transplantation by combining a novel RNA-delivery strategy with iterative rounds of genome deletion and complementation using state-of-the art CRISPR-Cas9 assisted genome editing. The proposed research will fundamentally advance synthetic biology, and could positively answer the transformative questions: Can we create, program and evolve life-like systems that can survive in both cell-free and intracellular environments? Can we use these entities to construct an alternative biology in which central cellular activities are encoded on genomes not made of DNA?

416    Professor Lord Christopher    Institute of Cancer Research    2018-04-01    2021-03-31    Exploiting the PARP1 trapping qualities of talazoaprib to optimise the treatment of breast    Although PARP inhibitors (PARPi) such as the Pfizer drug talazoparib are able to elicit profound and sustained therapeutic responses in breast cancer, drug resistance is an issue. We have previously found that reversion mutations BRCA1 or BRCA2 cause PARPi resistance. Others have shown that restoring DNA resection in BRCA1 mutant tumour cells, via 53BP1 or REV7 dysfunction, also causes PARPi resistance. In new unpublished data, we also show that mutations in PARP1 itself cause PARPi resistance by altering the ability of PARPi to “trap” PARP1 on DNA. This new data thus highlights how understanding the nature of trapped PARP1 could be key to understanding tumour cell and patient responses to PARPi in breast cancer. To understand this, we propose to study the composition of the trapped PARP nucleoprotein complex that is caused by the Pfizer PARP inhibitor talazoparib. To prosecute these studies, we will use a combination of standard and more novel biochemical approaches as well as in vitro genetic perturbation CRISPR-CAs9 approaches. We will use a multidisciplinary team to prosecute the work, with the contributions from those with expertise in functional genormic and PARP inhibitor biology (Lord) and the clinical assessment of novel therapeutic approaches in breast cancer including PART inhibitors (Tutt). In this proposal, we request funds to cover the salaries and running costs of two post-doctoral fellows and a contrinution towards bioinoformatic support to carry out the work. Identifying and understanding how novel approaches for treating breast cancer is critical to improving outcomes in the disease. We believe that observations and findings made in this work will (i) enhance the understanding of how tumour suppressor gene defects impart a series of genetic dependencies/vulnerabilities upon tumour cells; and (ii) inform how a molecularly-defined subset of breast cancer is best treated.

My 2018 publications in European Heart Journal and Circulation Research showed HCM could be phenocopied by a set of 11 isogenic CRISPR/Cas9 variants of the MYH7 gene (beta myosin heavy chain) of human pluripotent stem cell-cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs). Twelve different phenotyping methods were used to interrogate the generated human cell lines, often showing contradictory results relative to animal models. Importantly, a cohort of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) potentially linked to HCM was identified by RNA sequencing. This collection of cell resources, underpinning technologies and putative lncRNA pathway controllers form the basis of this proposal. Hypothesis and plans: I hypothesise that unveiling the function of these novel lncRNAs will provide new mechanisms and drug targets for HCM. To test this hypothesis, I propose to modulate the expression of these lncRNAs in hPSC-CMs by harnessing the dead Cas9 technology. I will then assess the phenotype of up/down-regulating these lncRNAs in the context of HCM, by employing the methodologies previously developed (molecular and functional assays). This will enable determining the role of lncRNAs in HCM - either as disease-causing or cardioprotective per se, or as gene modifiers regulating the primary disease effects caused by the structural defect. Finally, prediction and validation of lncRNA-interacting proteins by coupling in silico tools with molecular biology methods will result in the identification of new pathways involved in HCM, shedding light into the development of future drug treatments. If replacement of 50% of animals for HCM research could be achieved by further validating the human model, this will equate to sparing of 2100-5000 animals (of all species) in severe procedures in the next 10 years.

If replacement of 50% of animals for HCM research could be achieved by further validating the human model, this will equate to sparing of 2100-5000 animals (of all species) in severe procedures in the next 10 years.

420    Dr Lee Lydia Sarah Hui    ETH Zurich - ETHZ    2018-01-09    2022-08-31    Identification of convergent molecular pathways in autism spectrum disorder by in utero genome editing and transcriptional profiling of cortical projection neuron subtypes    Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a collection of phenotypically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders affecting 1/100 individuals worldwide, and recent patient sequencing based studies have revealed over 1000 risk alleles. Evidence is mounting that suggests the neurobiological basis of ASD is associated with projection neurons (PNs) of the mammalian neocortex during midfetal development. Although these advancements provide an entry point into studying the disorder, the molecular underpinnings of ASD as well as how the disparate risk alleles converge onto a common set of pathways leading to similar behavioral phenotypes are largely unknown. To identify the convergent pathways underlying ASD, we will genetically perturb ASD risk genes in utero and directly compare the resulting molecular, cellular, and morphological phenotypes in cortical PN subtypes. Building on our previous work on mouse models of ASD, transcriptional profiling, and in vivo and in utero genome editing, we will: Aim 1 - Develop CRISPR-Cas9 reagents to perturb high confidence ASD risk genes in utero. We will develop and validate CRISPR-Cas9 reagents targeting mouse orthologs of high confidence ASD (hcASD) risk genes CHD8, DYRK1A, ARID1B, and POGZ by in utero electroporation (IUE) and genome editing analysis in mice. Methods enabling the rapid modeling of loss-of-function (LOF) variants in ASD risk genes in vivo will facilitate the systematic interrogation of the underlying mechanism(s) of ASD.Aim 2 - Investigate gene-edited cortical progenitors and projection neurons in situ to reveal shared phenotypes. In mice harboring LOF variants in select hcASD risk genes, we will investigate cortical progenitor and PN phenotypes, such as progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation as well as PN composition and lamination, respectively. This approach will pinpoint relevant cell types and phenotypes shared upon perturbation of select hcASD risk genes.Aim 3 - Characterize gene-edited cortical projection neuron subtypes by transcriptional profiling to identify shared ASD pathways. From gene-edited mice, we will purify cortical PN subtypes harboring LOF variants in select hcASD risk genes and perform transcriptional profiling of each population at high resolution. An integrated analysis across genotypes will allow us to distinguish gene-specific effects from shared pathways, enabling the identification of critical cell types and the convergent pathways underlying perturbation of select hcASD risk genes.Aim 4 - Characterize gene-edited neurons by pooled in utero perturbation and single cell transcriptional profiling to identify convergent ASD pathways. Using pooled lentiviral CRISPR libraries, we will perturb 100 probable and high confidence ASD risk genes in utero, such that single cells receive single perturbation, and subsequently perform single cell transcriptional profiling. After linking ASD risk gene perturbations with single cell transcriptional profiles, we will perform an integrated analysis to characterize the cell states and convergent molecular pathways shared upon perturbation of 100 ASD risk genes.The proposed studies will establish an in utero methodology for rapidly perturbing and phenotypically investigating meaningful cell types harboring LOF variants in ASD risk genes in vivo, thereby overcoming current limitations in ASD research involved with animal model generation and cross-model comparisons. By investigating multiple ASD risk genes and cell types in parallel, under identical experimental conditions, we will elucidate critical features underlying the neurobiological mechanism(s) of ASD. The methodologies developed here will be a valuable resource to the field and can be extended to any gene or gene set of interest.    Swiss National Science Foundation    Project funding (Div.

431    Dr de la Vega Laureano    University of Dundee    2017-02-01    2023-01-31    HIPK2 as a novel determinant of cancer therapeutic resistance    Background The homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) is a multi-functional transcriptional regulator that works as an integrator of stress signals and is involved in cell growth, apoptosis, proliferation and development. Traditionally HIPK2 has been considered a potential tumour suppressor, but recent studies suggest a novel oncogenic role for HIPK2. While the pathways involved in its tumour suppressor role are relatively well studied, the underlying mechanisms mediating the pro-oncogenic function(s) of HIPK2 remain unclear. We have already uncovered a link connecting HIPK2 with a mayor pathway involved in chemoresistance. Our hypothesis is that HIPK2 is a major factor controlling cancer cell fate, by inducing either cell death or cell survival, and it can promote chemoresistance by activating multiple pathways. Understanding the conditions that drive HIPK2 towards cell survival and the signalling pathways involved, could establish HIPK2 as a potential therapeutic/prognostic factor. Aims Aim 1. To identify and characterise pathways involved in HIPK2-mediated chemoresistance Aim 2. To determine what makes HIPK2 a pro-survival factor Aim 3. To define the potential clinical value of HIPK2 Methods - CRISPR/Cas9 to knock-out, knock-in mutations or tag endogenous genes. - SILAC and RNA-seq to identify pathways regulated by HIPK2. - CRISPR-based library screening to identify HIPK2-regulated pathways involved in chemoresistance. - Automated quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence analysis of HIPK2 in tumours and correlation with survival/response to treatment. How the results of this research will be used It will provide key insights into the mechanisms underlying tumour therapeutic responses, by characterising new pathways involved in chemoresistance that may reveal HIPK2 as a potential prognostic/therapeutic target.

433    Professor Katan Matilda    Università degli Studi di Trento    2015-10-01    2020-09-30    Synthetic Lethal Phenotype Identification through Cancer Evolution Analysis    Prostate cancer (PCA) is a genetically heterogeneous disease. Advances in targeted hormonal therapy (second generation anti-androgens) have led to more effective management of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Despite these highly potent drugs, disease recurs with new genomic and epigenetic alterations. In this ERC proposal, I will leverage my expertise in cancer genomics and a new computational methodology to unravel the landscape of lethal PCA, with a focus on determining the Achilles' heel of these aggressive tumours. In Aim 1, I will take advantage of DNA sequencing data from over 1000 patient-derived tumour samples and use highly innovative mathematical algorithms to create a detailed evolution chart for each tumour and identify driver events leading to CRPC. After nominating candidate drivers, we propose testing 10 using in vitro gain- and loss-of-function validations experiments (i. e. , CRISPR/Cas9, shRNA, and Tet-On assays) in PCA cell lines using migration, invasion, and cell cycle as readouts. In Aim 2, I will focus on genomic events that occur in recalcitrant CRPC, positing that genetic alterations occurring prior or secondary to treatment harbour clues into resistance. In vitro validations will be performed on the top 10 biomarkers. In Aim 3, I will nominate synthetic lethality combinations by mining CRPC genomic data taken from Stand Up 2 Cancer CRPC clinical trials. I will prioritize mutually exclusive genomic alterations in genes for which approved drugs exist. The top 5-10 candidates will be validated in a prostate lineage-specific manner. In summary, this ERC proposal will leverage my many years of expertise in PCA genomics and emerging public and private CRPC datasets to uncover driver mutations that will enhance our understanding of recalcitrant CRPC. Successful completion of this study should lead to novel treatment approaches for CRPC and to a computational model that may transform our approach to evaluating other cancers.

434    Prof Hannon Greg    University of Cambridge    2014-10-01    2019-09-30    RNAi, Cancer and Non-Coding RNAs    Our attention has historically been focused on four major areas. First, we have worked for the past 15 years on understanding the biological functions of non-coding RNAs and the mechanisms by which these RNAs act. Most recently, we have worked extensively on a small RNA based innate immune system, the piRNA pathway, and its role in protecting germline integrity in animals. Secondly, we attempt to tackle critical problems in cancer biology, with a major focus on breast and pancreatic cancer. We use mouse models, human tissues, and innovative approaches to understand aspects of disease ranging from the genetics of early, non-invasive cancers to critical pathways driving metastasis. We also work to understand the roles of long non-coding RNAs in normal development and how their functions might be disrupted in cancer. Building from our observations that small RNAs direct DNA methylation during germ cell development in animals, we have developed a broader interest in epigenetic regulation, both in normal cell and in cancer. Finally, have a long history of technological innovation, having developed approaches such as short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) and exome capture. Current technology development is occurring in several areas including mining information inherent in tumor heterogeneity, optimization of crispr-based strategies, and building general platforms for control of biological processes by light.

435    Dr. Westra Edze    University of Exeter    2017-01-01    2021-12-31    The evolutionary ecology of bacterial immune mechanisms    Bacteria have a range of immune mechanisms, but it is unclear why this diverse armamentarium evolved. The most important immune mechanisms are (1) Surface Modification (SM) (2) Abortive infection (Abi) (3) Restriction Modification (R-M) (4) CRISPR-Cas and (5) prokaryotic Argonaute (pAgo), all of which can occur as stand-alone mechanisms or in combination. The individual mechanisms differ in key aspects, such as their fitness costs (constitutive versus inducible), specificity (indiscriminate versus specific), the recipient of the benefits (individual versus group), the speed of de novo resistance evolution (rapid versus slow), and heritability of immunity. Here I will take a combined in vitro and in vivo approach to tease apart the variables that drive the evolution of these diverse stand-alone and integrated bacterial immune strategies in nature, and examine their associated co-evolutionary dynamics. I focus on three ecological variables that are consistently important in host-symbiont co-evolution: (1) force of infection (2) spatial structure (3) presence of mutualists (plasmids). First, I will perform in vitro manipulations using Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 variants that carry either single or multiple immune mechanisms. Next, I will sequence metagenomes, transcriptomes and viromes of microbial communities from environments that differ in ecological variables that are important in vitro, to examine their importance in vivo. Key ecological mechanisms identified in the first two parts of the project will be used to guide mesocosm experiments to experimentally confirm that these mechanisms are the drivers of the observed patterns of resistance and co-evolution in nature. Finally, I will share my data with mathematical biologists to generate theoretical models to predict and manipulate the evolution of bacterial immune mechanisms, which will facilitate tailored species protection in agriculture and industry.

436    Dr. Westra Edze    King's College London    2016-07-01    2020-12-31    A new Drosophila-based strategy to study mitochondrial transport and neuronal ageing in vivo.    This proposal is based on a new in vivo system that I have established to study axonal transport of organelles in wing sensory neurons of Drosophila melanogaster. This system allows, for the first time, organelle transport to be studied in intact adult neurons of living Drosophila over time. Longitudinal studies in this system have revealed a remarkable age-dependent decline in mitochondrial transport. My previous data suggest that experimental upregulation of mitochondrial motility delays age-associated protein aggregation and increases neuronal healthspan. I also found compelling evidence that an evolutionarily conserved signalling pathway can regulate mitochondrial transport in axons of ageing neurons. I propose to exploit this innovative imaging assay to understand the molecular mechanisms linking this specific signalling cascade to mitochondria transport and neuronal ageing. Initially, I will undertake a biochemical characterisation of this signalling pathway in Drosophila, including the identification of downstream targets that regulate transport. By using CRISPR genome engineering and tissue specific RNAi,I will attempt to identify the key regulatory nodes of the pathway. This will be followed by phenotypic analysis of neuronal function. After the Drosophila work, I will test the relevance of our findings in mammalian neurons. These experiments will be performed in cultured mouse motor neurons derived from embryonic stem cells in which mitochondria will be fluorescently labeled with a commercial dye. Finally, I will explore whether chemical activation of the pathway is sufficient to increase mitochondrial trafficking in single neurons of mouse sciatic nerve in vivo. To achieve this, I will use an available transgenic mouse strain, known as MitoMouse, which expresses a fluorescent marker of mitochondria in neurons. In these experiments,mitochondrial transport in young and old mice will be compared before and after challenging the neurons with pathway agonists.

439    Dr Zhao Bin    Zheijang University    2016-03-01    2020-12-31    The role of Hippo signaling spatial dynamics in organ size control and cancer    Organ size determination is one of the most intriguing unsolved mysteries in biology. In recent years, the Hippo signaling pathway was found to play an evolutionarily conserved key role in organ size determination through regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis and stemness. More importantly, deregulation of the Hippo pathway underlies tumorigenesis of many human cancers. In response to signals such as mechanical stress, the Hippo pathway Mst1/2-Lats1/2 kinase cascade phosphorylates and inhibits YAP and TAZ transcription co-activators, therefore regulates gene expression and tissue growth. Nevertheless, the subcellular localization of Hippo signaling is largely unknown. In this project, through collaborative efforts, we will tag all endogenous Hippo pathway proteins using CRISPR-mediated homologous recombination in both mammalian cells and Drosophila. This resource will allow mechanistic and functional analysis of subcellular spatial dynamics of Hippo pathway proteins upon physiological stimulation and during development or regeneration. The proposed work will not only address an important albeit obscure area of Hippo signaling and organ size control but will also demonstrate the general value of CRISPR-mediated protein tagging technique in solving the long-standing difficulty of cell signaling spatial dynamics investigation. This work will also open new directions for investigating the Hippo pathway in human cancer and regenerative medicine.    The Academy of Medical Sciences    Fellowship    111000.0GBP
440    Prof Miska Eric    University of Cambridge    2015-04-01    2018-03-31    Non-coding RNA and cancer: new mechanisms and therapeutic opportunities    The human genome is massively transcribed (70%), mostly into non-coding RNA. Specific classes of non-coding RNA have emerged as key regulators of gene expression. For example, microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of human disease gene that is key to cancer. Specifically, some miRNAs regulate cancer therapeutic targets acting as tumour suppressors or oncogenes. Some miRNAs are prognostic and diagnostic markers of cancer. Recently, a number of additional classes of non-coding RNA have emerged, e.g. Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Using our expertise in RNA molecular biology and genomics we will continue to determine how non-coding RNAs interface with cancer biology. In addition, we will develop new strategies for anti-cancer therapies. We will continue to use the powerful molecular genetic tools available in the laboratory model organism C. elegans. However, over the next five years we will take full advantage of recent advances in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS) and organoid culture technology alongside Cas9/CRISPR genome editing to translate our work to humans. We know that “simple” Mendelian disorders can be caused by a wide variety of genetic variants, from single nucleotide mutations to short insertions and deletions to larger structural variants. A number of such genetic variants are caused by the mobilization of genomic elements such as retrotransposons in the germline. However most research into complex disease such as cancer has focused on using genetic association methods on single nucleotide polymorphisms in conserved single copy regions of the genome. This overlooks fast evolving parts of the human genome, representing perhaps 50% of the total sequence. Our focus will be to investigate how piRNAs contribute to the epigenetic control of mobile elements, which in turn regulates their mobility. Epigenetic deregulation of mobile elements in the soma might also contribute to human disease including cancer. Over the last twenty years RNA interference (RNAi) has been explored as a novel drug platform, e.g. in cancer, but RNA delivery remains a hard problem. We will investigate recent advances in our understanding of naturally mobile (extracellular) non-coding RNA with respect to cancer therapy. We will characterize RNA-modifying enzymes for drug discovery. There are 65 distinct modifications of RNA known in eukaryotes. We will characterize RNA-modifying enzymes that are known to regulate cancer-related miRNAs and lncRNAs. Small molecule inhibitors of such enzymes might allow us to target non-coding RNA pathways using classical chemistry as a novel anti-cancer therapy.

441    Dr Khaled Walid    University of Cambridge    2016-10-02    2019-10-01    Cas9 mediated in vitro gene editing in primary mammary epithelial cells    Breast cancer affects 1 in 8 women in the UK and is the responsible for the death of 1000 women every month. One of the major challenges for the treatment of breast cancer is the heterogeneous nature of the disease. There is evidence that tumour heterogeneity could be attributed to the cell of origin of these tumours. For example, luminal breast cancer is thought to arise from differentiated cells, while basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) is thought to arise from undifferentiated progenitor and stem like cells. This would necessitate the expression and function of cell type specific factors, which determine the cells’ fate. Therefore, understanding the developmental hierarchy of normal mammary epithelial cells could pave way for the development of effective subtype specific treatments for breast cancer. The mouse provides an excellent model to study how different cell fate regulators are involved in mammary epithelial development and breast cancer development. However, with the advances in DNA sequencing and cancer genomics the number of candidate genes, which need to be investigated in the mouse, has increased. This lead to an increase in demand for genetically modified (GM) mice to perform these studies. In this project we aim to circumvent the need for the generation of new GM mice for breast cancer and mammary gland studies by capitalising on recent technical advances to generate a fast, cost effective and flexible approach to tag genes of interest directly in primary mammary epithelial cells. We will utilise the Crispr/Cas9 technology to delete or tag genes of interest in primary mammary epithelial cells in vitro and re-introduce them directly back into the mammary fatpad of recipient mice ready for downstream analysis. Our new approach will enable us to study novel genes of interest in the mammary gland without the need for generating new GM mice which will dramatically reduce the number of animals needed to perform breast cancer and mammary gland studies    National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research    Studentship    90000.0GBP
442    Dr Burr Marian    University of Cambridge    2016-05-01    2020-04-30    Understanding molecular mechanisms of leukaemia stem cell self-renewal to identify novel targets for therapy    Background Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is sustained and propagated by a small population of self-renewing leukaemic stem cells (LSC). Whilst the regulation of stem cell self-renewal is incompletely understood, transcriptional and epigenetic networks play a critical role. Abnormal epigenetic regulation is a key mechanism underpinning the pathogenesis of AML and the reversibility of epigenetic modifications creates opportunity for therapeutic intervention. LSC are frequently resistant to conventional chemotherapy and there is a need for novel therapies effective against these cells. However, the ability to study LSC has been limited as they are a rare population in AML and once transferred to culture in vitro they rapidly differentiate into more mature leukaemic blasts. The Dawson laboratory has recently developed a technique to maintain LSC in culture indefinitely presenting a unique opportunity to study this elusive population. Aims i)Use functional proteomics to identify cell surface and intracellular proteins differentially expressed in LSC compared to normal haematopoietic stems cells (HSC) and characterise cellular pathways activated in LSC and altered during differentiation ii)Identify proteins, and in particular epigenetic regulators, essential for LSC survival and self-renewal Methods I will perform a differential analysis of the plasma membrane and whole cell proteome of enriched populations of LSC, leukaemic blasts and HSC-like cells. This novel approach will identify proteins upregulated in LSC. Early changes in the LSC proteome during differentiation into leukaemic blasts will be quantified using multiplexed isobaric tandem mass tags. To identify proteins essential for LSC survival and self-renewal I will perform parallel in vitro negative selection screens in LSC, leukaemic blasts and HSC-like cells using a bespoke shRNA library targeting epigenetic regulators and a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA library. Integrated analysis of the genetic and proteomic data will identify candidate proteins critical for LSC maintenance. The molecular and functional role of these proteins in LSC self-renewal will be characterised in vitro and in vivo in a murine model of leukaemia. Significance A combined functional proteomic and genetics approach provides a powerful means to identify the specific cellular pathways activated in LSC that drive malignant self-renewal. My primary focus is to identify epigenetic regulators required for the maintenance of LSC, but not HSC, to reveal novel therapeutic targets in AML. Proteomic characterisation of LSC to identify specific cell surface markers will facilitate isolation of these cells and inform the development of future antibody-based therapies.

443    Dr. Buganim Yosef    The Hebrew University Of Jerusalem    2016-03-01    2021-02-28    The Molecular Basis of Somatic Nuclear Reprogramming    The direct conversion approach and the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide an invaluable resource of cells for disease modelling, drug screening, and patient-specific cell-based therapy. However, the directly converted cells are not stable, and the vast majority of iPSCs exhibit poor developmental potential as measured by stringent pluripotency tests. This suggests that the prevailing method of reprogramming is not ideal and leads to aberrant/incomplete conversion. To improve the quality of the converted cells, efforts should be focused on uncovering the molecular mechanisms that characterize the nuclear reprogramming process. There are two critical hurdles that hinder the progress of deciphering the elements that dictate successful reprogramming: (1) The ability to detect and capture solely the rare cells that eventually will be converted and (2) to monitor the transcriptional profile of cells at the single-cell level. Single-cell technology is in its infancy and many of the methods used today are characterized by high noise to signal ratio. In this grant proposal we intend to overcome these limitations by (1) establishing a complex fluorescent knock-in reporter system using the CRISPR/Cas9 method to capture the early rare reprogrammable cells and by (2) employing several cutting-edge single-cell technologies, RNA-Seq, Fluidigm BioMark and single-molecule mRNA-FISH, to segregate the real signal from the noise. To identify common and more global elements that facilitate nuclear reprogramming at large, we will trace in parallel, reprogrammable cells from two different somatic cell conversion models that reach high degree of nuclear reprogramming, and analyse their transcriptome using sophisticated bioinformatic tools. This study will provide a general overview of the changes that occur during the conversion of various cell types and will uncover the basic features that are essential to reach safe and complete conversion.

446    Dr Timsah Zahra    University of Leeds    2016-06-01    2017-10-31    Proteomic and structural profiling of PXXP-SH3 interactions as key regulators of membrane receptor activity    Membrane receptor signalling occurs upon growth factor stimulation. Interestingly, I have recently shown that fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 signalling can also be triggered under non-stimulated conditions. This occurs when proteins with Src homology 3 (SH3) domain bind its C-terminal proline-rich-motif (PXXP) and modulate its activity to induce a homeostatic or oncogenic response. Whether this occurs in other receptors remains unclear. .Notably, the genome encodes for >50 PXXP-containing receptors and >300 SH3 domain-containing proteins. Thus, I will test the hypothesis that SH3-PXXP interactions are abundant and critical for functional regulation of receptors which dictates cellular response. I will use 2 model receptors to: 1. Generate short biotinylated PXXP-peptides immobilized on streptavidin-coated-beads to “fish-out” bound proteins from cell lysates. I will then employ mass-spectrometry to determine the identity of the SH3 domain-containing hits (to be validated by CRISPR/Cas9 pull-downs and fluorescent-lifetime-imaging). 2. Run pilot biophysical experiments like microscale thermophoresis to reduce confounding elements such us complex formation rather than direct SH3-PXXP binding events. 3. Evaluate functional modulation of receptors by running Reverse-Phase-Protein-Array and functional assays. This project will set the foundation for characterizing novel interactions to enhance our understanding of signalling mechanisms; with impact on structural modelling of receptors and cancer therapeutics.

450    Prof. MERKLER Doron    UNIVERSITE DE GENEVE    2020-05-01    2025-04-30    Molecular pathology of anti-viral T cell responses in the central nervous system    Immune responses against viruses in the central nervous system (CNS) can result in devastating outcomes. Even non-cytolytic CD8+ T cell interactions, which purge viruses from neurons without triggering cell death, can induce permanent damage. Yet, how this immune response irreversibly disrupts neuronal homeostasis remains unclear. Here, we will elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underlie non-cytolytic CD8+ T cell engagement with infected neurons and their consequences on neuron function in vivo. We hypothesize that inflammatory signalling in neurons, induced by non-cytolytic CD8+ T cell interactions, triggers metabolic and epigenetic changes that underpin permanent neuronal dysfunction. "PATHOCODE" will test this hypothesis by harnessing a unique animal model of T cell-driven virus encephalitis in the following objectives: 1. Discern neuronal subset-specific vulnerabilities and antigen-dependent versus bystander effects in the inflamed CNS. We will perform single nucleus RNA sequencing to examine whether T cell engagement (a) differentially affects molecularly distinct neurons, and (b) affects non-targeted, uninfected neurons. 2. Uncover the consequences of non-cytolytic T cell engagement on neuronal metabolism. We will use cell-specific mitochondrial reporter mice to investigate immune-driven metabolic adaptation of neurons in vivo. 3. Determine how non-cytolytic T cell engagement affects the neuronal epigenome. We will employ cell-specific nucleus/ribosome reporter mice to elucidate how T cell engagement affects the translatome and epigenome of infected cells. 4. Rescue T cell-mediated neuronal dysfunction by restoring metabolic pathways. We will exploit recent CRISPR/Cas9 technological advances to restore neuronal gene expression and uncover the relevance of immune-driven metabolic and epigenomic changes to disease. Our study will thus provide novel molecular concepts about immune-driven neuronal alterations in CNS inflammatory diseases.    European Research Council    Consolidator Grant    1999954.0EUR
451    Dr. MÄHÖNEN Ari Pekka    HELSINGIN YLIOPISTO    2019-09-01    2024-08-31    Thickening of plant organs by nested stem cells    Growth originates from meristems, where stem cells are located. Lateral meristems, which provide thickness to tree stems and other plant organs, include vascular cambium (produces xylem [wood] and phloem); and cork cambium (forms cork, a tough protective layer). We recently identified the molecular mechanism that specifies stem cells of vascular cambium. Unexpectedly, this same set of experiments revealed also novel aspects of the regulation of cork cambium, a meristem whose development has remained unknown. CORKtheCAMBIA aims to identify the stem cells of cork cambium and reveal how they mechanistically regulate plant organ thickening. Thus, stemming from these novel unpublished findings and my matching expertise on plant stem cells and lateral growth, the timing is perfect to discover the molecular mechanism underlying specification of stem cells of cork cambium. To identify the origin of stem cells of cork cambium, 1st-we will combine lineage tracing with a detailed molecular marker analysis. To deduce the cell dynamics of cork cambium, 2nd-we will follow regeneration of the stem cells after ablation of this meristem. To discover the molecular factors regulating the stem cell specification of cork cambium, 3rd-we will utilize molecular genetics and a novel method (inducible CRISPR/Cas9 mutant targeting) being developed in my lab. Since the lateral growth is orchestrated by two adjacent, nested meristems, cork and vascular cambia, the growth process must be tightly co-regulated. Thus, 4th-an in silico model of the intertwined growth process will be generated. By combining modelling with experimentation, we will uncover mechanistically how cork and vascular cambium coordinate lateral growth. CORKtheCAMBIA will thus provide long-awaited insight into the regulatory mechanisms specifying the stem cells of lateral meristem as whole, lay the foundation for studies on radial thickening and facilitate rational manipulation of lateral meristems of crop plants and trees.

Host immune responses can play either protective or a pathologic role during infection.Therefore, understanding of the regulatory networks and signaling pathways that determine the magnitude andquality of an individual's antiviral immune response has important implications for human health, since thesegenes/pathways could be therapeutically targeted to control viral replication, to treat aberrant immuneresponses, or they may represent targets for enhancing the safety and efficacy of vaccines against a widerange of viral pathogens.Polymorphic host genes and regulatory networks have a major impact on immune response variation in humanpopulations. However, confounding environmental factors and/or ethical concerns limit the types of studiesthat can be conducted in humans. Therefore, genetically tractable model systems that capture the range ofgenetic and phenotypic diversity seen in humans are needed to mechanistically dissect the genetics of immunevariation. To address this need, we have used the Collaborative Cross (CC), a highly diverse mouse geneticreference population, to identify and characterize polymorphic host genes that regulate baseline and IAV-induced innate and adaptive immunity. As part of this effort, we have quantified variation in virus-inducedinnate and adaptive immune responses and disease over a 45 day time-course (Days 2, 4, 7, 10, 15, 28, and45 post infection) in a panel of 110 CC RIX lines (reproducible F1 crosses between CC recombinant inbred(RI) lines that model heterozygous Human populations).

Since its emergence about three months ago, this virus has caused more than 120,000 infections and 4,300deaths worldwide and is rapidly spreading to virtually every country including the United States. This globalhealth emergency must be immediately addressed by rapidly developing medial countermeasures. Our bacteriophage (phage) T4 vaccine platform is uniquely suited to address this threat. Developed in PI'slaboratory, the T4 vaccines have been proven to generate robust humoral as well as cellular immune responsesand confer complete protection against anthrax and plague in multiple animal models including mice, rats,rabbits, and macaques. The T4 vaccines do not need an adjuvant as its surface structure mimics the Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) of viral pathogens and stimulate strong innate and adaptive immunity. The 120 x 86 nm phage T4 capsid is packaged with 171 kb genome and decorated with two non-essentialouter capsid proteins; 870 molecules of Soc (small outer capsid protein) and 155 copies of Hoc (highly antigenicouter capsid protein). In specific aim 1, a series of T4-corona phages will be constructed by incorporating SARS-CoV-2 virion components individually and in combinations, by CRISPR engineering. The gene encoding theentire spike ectodomain will be inserted into phage genome under the control of the strong CAG promoter. Uponimmunization, host cells (myocytes and antigen presenting cells at the site of immunization) take up phageparticles and secrete the ectodomain trimers continuously, stimulating the immune system for weeks to months.The gene for the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S protein will be inserted such that the RBD will be expressedin host cells, as well as in E. coli as a Soc fusion protein which will then be displayed on phage capsid up to 870copies per capsid. The ectodomain of E protein will be fused to Hoc and displayed up to 155 copies per capsid.Finally, ~400 copies of N protein will be packaged inside the capsid as part of the scaffolding core. In specific aim 2, the above T4-corona recombinant phages will be evaluated for elicitation of SARS-CoV-2 virion-specific immune responses in a mouse model. Mice will be immunized with purified phage particlesintramuscularly and the immune responses will be quantified by ELISA, competitive receptor binding, ELISpot,and virus neutralization assays. We expect that the T4-corona vaccines will elicit robust antibody and cellularresponses and also inform which candidate(s) will be most effective in blocking SARS-CoV-2 infection. We have streamlined the CRISPR engineering such that the proposed T4 vaccines can be constructed inabout 4 weeks and the animal testing can be completed in about 12 weeks. The candidate vaccines will then beavailable for clinical trials and vaccine manufacture. The T4 vaccine will be exceedingly easy to manufacture,scale, and distribute globally, and could potentially lead to a breakthrough to avert the coronavirus crisis.

Uponimmunization, host cells (myocytes and antigen presenting cells at the site of immunization) take up phageparticles and secrete the ectodomain trimers continuously, stimulating the immune system for weeks to months.The gene for the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S protein will be inserted such that the RBD will be expressedin host cells, as well as in E. coli as a Soc fusion protein which will then be displayed on phage capsid up to 870copies per capsid. The ectodomain of E protein will be fused to Hoc and displayed up to 155 copies per capsid.Finally, ~400 copies of N protein will be packaged inside the capsid as part of the scaffolding core. In specific aim 2, the above T4-corona recombinant phages will be evaluated for elicitation of SARS-CoV-2 virion-specific immune responses in a mouse model. Mice will be immunized with purified phage particlesintramuscularly and the immune responses will be quantified by ELISA, competitive receptor binding, ELISpot,and virus neutralization assays. We expect that the T4-corona vaccines will elicit robust antibody and cellularresponses and also inform which candidate(s) will be most effective in blocking SARS-CoV-2 infection. We have streamlined the CRISPR engineering such that the proposed T4 vaccines can be constructed inabout 4 weeks and the animal testing can be completed in about 12 weeks. The candidate vaccines will then beavailable for clinical trials and vaccine manufacture. The T4 vaccine will be exceedingly easy to manufacture,scale, and distribute globally, and could potentially lead to a breakthrough to avert the coronavirus crisis.

456    Professor Smith Geoffrey    University of Cambridge    2017-12-01    2020-11-30    Using viruses to study kinesin-1 recruitment, regulation and function    This proposal aims to rapidly generate vaccine candidates against the 2019 novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Since its emergence about three months ago, this virus has caused more than 120,000 infections and 4,300deaths worldwide and is rapidly spreading to virtually every country including the United States. This globalhealth emergency must be immediately addressed by rapidly developing medial countermeasures. Our bacteriophage (phage) T4 vaccine platform is uniquely suited to address this threat. Developed in PI'slaboratory, the T4 vaccines have been proven to generate robust humoral as well as cellular immune responsesand confer complete protection against anthrax and plague in multiple animal models including mice, rats,rabbits, and macaques. The T4 vaccines do not need an adjuvant as its surface structure mimics the Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) of viral pathogens and stimulate strong innate and adaptive immunity. The 120 x 86 nm phage T4 capsid is packaged with 171 kb genome and decorated with two non-essentialouter capsid proteins; 870 molecules of Soc (small outer capsid protein) and 155 copies of Hoc (highly antigenicouter capsid protein).

457    Professor Loughlin John    Newcastle University    2015-05-04    2020-05-03    Exploiting osteoarthritis genetics to enhance cartilage integrity    Our aim is to make a substantial difference to the understanding and application of a fundamental cause of osteoarthritis: its genetic basis. Utilising a range of techniques, we shall take each known OA susceptibility locus and refine it to the point at which we have identified the causal risk alleles. Using stem cells, we shall track the activity of each susceptibility gene during chondrogenesis. These data will be integrated with gene expression analyses of patient joint tissues to clarify at which point during tissue differentiation the OA susceptibility genes are most active. Using stem cells and CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we shall then perform genome editing. This will be done on each causal allele, in isolation and in combination with causal alleles from other OA susceptibility loci, and the impact of the engineered changes on cartilage will be assessed. Overall our programme will 1) identify and validate OA causal alleles, and 2) investigate the functional effect of these polymorphisms by generating engineered cartilage containing defined risk alleles. In so doing, we shall uncover which polymorphisms and which combination of polymorphisms can be best exploited to create cartilage resilient to OA degradation. Our programme will therefore guide the development of new treatment modalities.    Versus Arthritis    Programme Grant Full application    1156602.0GBP

459    Professor Loughlin John    University of Cambridge    2018-11-01    2020-10-31    A novel murine model of squamous lung cancer    Squamous lung cancer (SQC) has been significantly more challenging to model than adenocarcinoma and progress in understanding its pathobiology and developing targeted therapeutics has been slow. To address this unmet need we have developed a novel orthotopic model of SQC. We have refined/optimised a protocol for the expansion of primary murine tracheobronchial epithelial cells (mTBECs). We have optimised the genetic manipulation of primary mTBECs via multilocus CRISPR and lentiviral transduction so that clinically relevant genotypes can be rapidly recreated in primary mTBECs. Further, we use inducible constructs so that genes of interest can be turned on and off at will throughout the natural history of the disease. The manipulated mTBECs are injected into the right lung of a syngeneic animal. Recipient mice therefore have an intact immune system and develop localised disease with the potential to metastasise. We have demonstrated in pilot data that this approach generates early murine SQC lesions within 3 weeks and large invasive tumours at around 4 months in wild type immunocompetent animals. This model can revolutionise the field - and lead to a dramatic reduction in the number of mice required to perform experiments; as well as refinements that reduce the ASPA Severity limit to Moderate and remove the need for toxin administration. Our scientific aims are to characterise the natural history of SQC in this novel syngeneic murine orthotopic model, to validate the model as being both reproducible and directly relevant to the human disease. Further, we will use luciferase-based imaging to ensure longitudinal studies on individual animals are feasible. Second we will apply the model to efficiently address key basic and translational issues: the necessity of a driving oncogene for SQC maintenance; the potential to use AKT inhibition for SQC chemoprevention; and a demonstration that it will have utility for studying the tumour immune microenvironment.
