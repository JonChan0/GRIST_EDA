A significant number of RBC disorders, including severe cases of anaemia, have been associated with KLF1 mutations. Research to date has focused on the intrinsic role of KFL1 in RBCs but KLF1 is also expressed and plays an extrinsic role in macrophages associated with the erythroid island (EI) niche. We developed a novel in vitro model of the human EI niche using induced pluripotent stem cell derived macrophages and have generated a database of EI-associated KLF1 target genes that encode factors that can promote RBC maturation. We now plan to test secreted and membrane-associated EI factors for their ability to enhance the maturation of RBCs using recombinant proteins and synthetic biotinylated peptides captured in on streptavidin-coated plates. Patients heterozygous for the dominant negative KLF1-E325K mutation present with circulating nucleated cells and a profound anaemia. To determine how KLF1 deficiency in the EI niche contributes to their pathology we will differentiate macrophages from iPSCs carrying a tamoxifen inducible iE325K-ERT2 and iPSCs derived from CDA patients. We will test their ability to support the proliferation and maturation of RBCs and identify factors that are aberrantly expressed within the genetically defective niche using RNA sequencing, comparative proteomics and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Chimeric co-cultures will be used to define the intrinsic and extrinsic effects of the E325K mutation and we will define the erythroid- and macrophage-specific targets of KLF1-E325K. Knock-in and knock-out iPSCs will be generated using CRISPR/CAS9 technology to validate the function of these targets. The characterisation of factors associated with the EI niche will impact on the treatment of anaemia, by identifying novel drug targets and designing optimised protocols for the production of therapeutic RBCs from limitless sources such as iPSCs.

We maintain that the disease is largely preventable. The proposed research programme aims to reduce incidence and death from this common cancer killer. Aims 1. Elucidate the genetic architecture of CRC risk and gene-environment interactions 2. Define the molecular perturbations responsible for CRC risk 3. Use such new understanding to develop interventions to reduce CRC risk and mortality. Methods We will continue to build the wealth of patient sample resources that we have assembled linked with clinical, pathological, demographic and survival outcome data. Informed by GWAS/EXOME genotyping data, we will perform "Next-Generation" sequencing (exome/whole genome) in genetically enriched patient groups. We will use whole genome sequencing to identify regulatory elements correlated with CRC risk and elucidate their functional roles by linking expression data from colorectal epithelium in CRC patients and cancer-free subjects. A prioritised gene shortlist will be interrogated using genome editing (CRISPR) approaches to explore pathogenicity and functional consequences in mice predisposed to CRC. We also aim to develop new approaches involving CRISPR targeting of genes in cultured organoids derived from patient colorectal mucosa samples with the ultimate aim of correcting deleterious genetic variants associated with CRC risk. We will investigate vitamin D as a modifiable risk factor, and potential chemopreventative agent, interacting with genotype at CRC risk loci. Genomewide GxE analysis will be conducted, integrating WGS data for regulatory elements (VDREs) with normal/tumour expression (RNAseq). In vitro studies of human colonic organoids and cell lines treated with vitamin D will complement clinical intervention studies. We will biopsy rectal mucosa in human subjects treated with vitamin D, using various functional readouts. How the results of this research will be used Our aim is to identify genes predisposing to CRC and intervene to reduce the risk imparted by genetic variation at those gene loci. We also aim to develop vitamin D prevention studies stratified by genotype. We will also further extend our published findings of GxE effects on CRC survival outcome due to interaction of vitamin D level and SNP genotypes. This highly translational programme has implications for interventions in CRC prevention, survival and risk stratification in population screening programmes.

2	Professor Johann de Bono	Institute of Cancer Research	None	2018-10-01	2021-09-30	Identifying and validating actionable targets to block androgen receptor splicing.	BACKGROUND: Many prostate cancers remain invariably lethal, driven by continued AR signalling through constitutively active splice variants (AR-SVs) that cause endocrine therapy resistance and radioresistance due to increased non-homologous end joining DNA repair of double strand breaks. Targeting AR-SV is challenging due to the intrinsically disordered structure of the N-terminal domain. Alternative AR-SV targeting strategies are urgently needed. HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize that targeting key spliceosome components will block AR-SV generation to reverse endocrine treatment and radiation resistance. PRELIMINARY DATA: AR-SV expression is critical to castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) development and progression. BET inhibitors targeting BRD2, 3, 4, and siRNA to these proteins, block AR-SV generation despite continued expression of AR-FL, downregulating AR-SV mRNA and RNA splicing factors, including JMJD6, crucial to AR-SV generation. In parallel, orthogonal studies utilizing a targeted siRNA screen of known spliceosome components, confirmed that JMJD6 downregulation blocks AR-SV generation. Furthermore, our preliminary data indicate that JMJD6 is: A) Druggable in computer-assisted models; B) Upregulated in CRPC biopsies; and C) Associates with AR-driven transcripts in CRPC transcriptomes. AIMS: We will: A) Validate JMJD6 findings and evaluate if there are other spliceosome proteins critical to AR-SV generation; B) Confirm identified hits by targeted overexpression studies, generation of stable CRISPR knockouts and the study of patient derived xenografts (PDXs) before and after castration, and re-exposure to dihydrotestosterone after castration; C) Investigate the functional role of identified hits, including JMJD6, and elucidate hit druggability using the canSAR chemo-informatics database and through site directed mutagenesis studies of druggable target pockets, also determining through RNAseq studies their wider impact on transcription and splicing. IMPLICATIONS: We will identify druggable spliceosome proteins key to AR splicing for high throughput chemical screens to identify lead compounds for drug discovery efforts that can ultimately improve outcome from lethal mCRPC.

We have discovered that c-Met traffics and signals from autophagic related endomembranes, ARE, leading to enhanced cell viability in anchorage independent conditions. We hypothesize that autophagy, considered conduit for degradation only, also has a signalling role, which may be targeted in diseases such as cancer. Moreover, this signalling occurs on novel non-canonical autophagy endomembranes, poorly characterized. We aim to understand the signalling of c-Met on non-canonical autophagy endomembranes. Using state-of-the-art cell biology and microscopy, we will characterise the ARE and the role of non-canonical autophagy on c-Met trafficking and signalling. Using a recently described approach of proximal proteomic mapping in live cells by engineered ascorbic peroxidase, APEX, we will determine the molecular partners of c-Met trafficking and signalling on ARE. We will assess the physiological and pathological relevance of c-Met signalling on ARE. This project will be performed using panels of normal and cancer cell lines modified by CRISPR technology, with impaired canonical or impaired non-canonical autophagy. Shedding light and further the understanding of a totally novel function of autophagy (signalling) will have major impacts in cell biology. Moreover, a new physiological role of a recently discovered non-canonical autophagy pathway will be uncovered. This project could lead to the development of strategies to reduce or enhance c-Met signalling and more generally of other receptors. The relevance of our results will be applied to cancer in the view of finding new targets. Our results will have larger implications as autophagy and RTK signalling both play major roles in numerous physiological and pathological processes.

The FACSAria Fusion is a highly flexible and advanced flow cell based flow cytometer that can perform multi-parameter four-way sorting. The Aria flow cell-based detection method provides greater fluorescence sensitivity than alternative stream-in air based cell sorters, which is critical for many of the proposed studies. We have requested funds for a four laser (blue/red/violet/yellow-green) 18-parameter instrument to enable high dimension analysis of the cells during sorting. The violet laser will enable use of highly sensitive brilliant violet fluorochromes and the yellow-green laser will allow greater use of multiple fluorescent proteins. The instrument can also perform single cell index sorting into 384-well plates, which will enable our research teams to undertake single cell transcriptomics projects and sort CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene edited cells. The instrument is fully integrated into the biosafety cabinet enabling work to be undertaken with primary patient samples and hazard group 2 pathogens. Maintenance, assisting new users and staff training are essential for such a complex instrument, we have therefore requested funding for an experienced grade 7 manager for a 4-year period.

We will use the newly emergent CRISPR/Cas9 approach to generate isogenic cells that are either capable or incapable of expressing PML-II. These cells will be compared, using state-of-the-art RNAseq to analyse mRNA populations following treatment with IFN inducers or IFN itself. Similarly, we will use ChIP-seq to analyse the binding of key transcription factors (TFs) to chromatin that follows the application of these inducers, with or without PML-II. Thirdly, we will use stable isotope labelling (SILAC)-based quantitative proteomics to determine which proteins interact with the unique C-terminal domain of PML-II, which we have shown previously to be necessary for its function in transcription and for its association with specific TFs and co-activators. We will then correlate these data sets using powerful systems analysis tools to determine which TFs mediate PML-II-dependent responses. Natural variants of PML-II will be cloned by standard techniques and their ability to support robust innate immune response gene activation assessed by RT-qPCR analysis of mRNA from transfected cell cultures subjected to innate immune stimulation, an established assay of PML-II function. Variation in PML isoform expression and assembly in the cell will also be induced by short and long-term mild heat stress and the effects on the ability of cells to support virus infection and to mount innate immune responses assessed using immunofluorescence, RT-qPCR, western blotting and cytokine ELISA. Finally, short segments of PML-II will be generated by cDNA cloning and expression, and tested as potential inhibitors of the innate response, measured at the mRNA level using RT-qPCR.

6	Professor Anthony Day	University of Manchester	None	2020-01-01	2023-12-31	Understanding an endogenous mechanism that protects against osteoarthritis; towards a new paradigm for disease management	Osteoarthritis (OA) affects 1 in 3 adults aged 45+ in the UK and is becoming more prevalent in association with an ageing and obese population. Joint replacement is currently the only effective treatment for the pain and disability associated with end-stage OA. Patients and clinicians have identified an urgent need for disease-modifying OA drugs (DMOAD) to slow or halt joint degeneration, thereby relieving symptoms and delaying the requirement for surgery. Our understanding of disease-associated mechanisms in OA is growing, but we still don't know why many individuals do not develop symptomatic OA. Identification of intrinsic mechanisms that limit the onset and progression of OA will be key to the development of personalised treatment approaches. Our previous work identified that the TSG-6 protein has protective and anti-inflammatory effects in joint tissues and we are developing a TSG-6-based biological (Link_TSG6) as a DMOAD. We have shown that Link_TSG6 treatment inhibits cartilage damage and pain in a rodent model of OA and also supresses degradation of cultured cartilage explants from OA patients. The focus of this proposal is to establish the molecular pathways through which TSG-6, produced locally in articular joints, contributes to the intrinsic protective processes from the point where disease onset is triggered (e.g. by injury) through to established OA. The aims of this study are: (i) to use knee tissues from patients undergoing joint replacement surgery, in conjunction with RNAScope (a new technology to quantify gene expression), to determine how TSG-6 expression affects disease-associated pathways in chondrocytes and synovial cells in established OA (ii) to determine how Link_TSG6 treatment influences the molecular phenotypes of chondrocytes; (iii) to use mass spectrometry methods to identify synovial fluid biomarkers predictive of responsiveness to Link_TSG6 treatment; (iii) to generate conditional knockout mice and use these to determine how TSG-6 expression in the joint tissues affects the development of surgically-induced OA at molecular and histological levels; (iv) to use a combination of biochemical and biophysical methods, along with CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene editing in chondrocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells, to determine how the recently-identified interaction of TSG-6 with inflammatory cytokines contributes to its protective effects in cartilage. The intended outcomes of this research project will have a major impact on the personalised management and treatment of OA by: (i) identifying intrinsic protective mechanisms where variation between individuals might explain differences in the onset and progression of OA; and (ii) providing novel insights to support the development (and commercial uptake) of Link_TSG6 as a DMOAD with the potential to meet the needs of OA patients by relieving symptoms and delaying the need for joint replacement. Our ex vivo studies to date indicate that ~50% of patients are likely to be responsive to treatment with Link_TSG6, suggesting that individuals can be stratified into ‘responders’ and ‘non-responders’. Characterisation of the differences between chondrocytes from these subgroups has the potential to further our understanding of the OA disease process and enable new opportunities for diagnosis and treatment, including personalised medicine approaches.

7	Professor Malcolm Dunlop	University of Edinburgh	None	2018-04-01	2023-03-31	Genetic approaches to combating colorectal cancer	Cancer of the large bowel, or colorectal cancer (CRC), is a common and frequently fatal disease of multifactorial aetiology, affecting 43,000 people in the UK annually and causing ~16,000 deaths, with ~600,000 annual deaths worldwide. Genetic variation and environmental factors contribute to CRC causation. With increasing exposure to environmental risk factors, developing countries are experiencing dramatic increases in CRC incidence. Our research focuses on understanding the complex interplay of genes and environment on CRC susceptibility. Elucidating disease mechanisms not only provides novel insight into cancer causation, but also enables earlier detection and prevention. We employ a range of large-platform approaches to define genetic, and functional genomic, architectures of CRC risk. We establish the role of genetic risk factors through large, well-powered, genome-wide association (GWAS) studies and exome/whole-genome sequencing, then model systems to confirm, and then understand, the molecular genetic mechanisms underlying these genetic associations. Using RNAseq, ATACseq, Capture-C and ChIPseq analysis of normal and tumour human tissues, we explore the molecular and functional consequences of common genetic variation, enabled by our unique patient access, linked with well-curated clinical, pathology and survival data. In case-control and trio studies of extreme early onset CRC, we employ NextGen sequencing to search for rare high penetrance mutations in novel cancer susceptibility genes. Through epidemiological studies and mendelian randomisation, we are exploring the role of environmental risk factors and how these interplay with causal genetic risk factors. Importantly these provide insight to modifiable risk factors that interact with genetic main effects, hence can be considered as “precision-prevention” approaches. Having refined description of genetic and environmental factors in large correlative studies, we are exploiting genome editing approaches (CRISPR) in cultured human and mouse intestinal and tumour organoids to explore the effects of perturbing putative causal pathways. Organoids provide a representative experimental human tissue model, allowing us to explore downstream functional and phenotypic consequences of manipulating genetic sequences - including deletion of putative causal gene(s) and genome editing to replace precise genomic control regions responsible for cancer risk. Using organoid technology, we are beginning to explore effects of multiple common genetic variants, as well as combinations of known key CRC drivers, such as upregulation of wnt signalling. Finally, we are using genome editing approaches to model human common genetic variation in mouse, thereby enabling us to extrapolate to whole-organism environments that are not feasible in humans. With a strong clinical translational emphasis, a key aspect of the Programme is our ability to modify genetic and environmental risk through intervention. Already, modification of genetic risk factors by vitamin D in human organoids and in human subjects treated with vitamin D are showing encouraging beneficial effects on gene expression and phenotypic changes using intestinal organoids. With a unique blend of discovery science, exploring mechanisms, disease models and ability to translate laboratories findings to clinical settings, we are extremely well-placed to make beneficial impact in human health in the field of a common cancer killer.

8	Professor Stephen Brown	MRC Mammalian Genetics Unit	None	1997-10-01	2100-12-31	Disease Model Discovery	The aim of the Disease Model Discovery programme is to generate novel mouse models of disease providing a key resource for the elucidation and characterisation of new genes and pathways involved with diverse disease systems. The programme delivers a critical underpinning to our intramural research programmes at MRC Harwell, as well as furnishing a wider platform for gene and pathway discovery for the biomedical sciences community within the UK and abroad. Currently, large-scale mutagenesis and phenotyping platforms at MRC Harwell focus on the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) pipeline for the generation and identification of mouse models. The IMPC mutagenesis and phenotyping pipeline is a key ongoing programme for the discovery of novel genes associated with both early-onset and late-onset disease phenotypes. However, there is an increasing focus on the delivery of late-onset phenotypes. Diseases associated with ageing pose an increasing social and financial burden on society and represent a vital imperative for research in the biomedical sciences. There have been considerable advances, for example through GWAS studies, in identifying putative loci and pathways involved in diseases of ageing. Nevertheless, our knowledge of the genes and pathways involved with late-onset disease is neither comprehensive nor complete. As part of MRC funding to Programme 1 over the next five years we plan to introduce over 100 genes into the IMPC pipeline encompassing both early-onset and late-onset phenotyping platforms. This effort will be supplemented by additional funding from the NIH which will enable us to feed a further ~200 genes into the IMPC pipeline for the determination of both early and late-onset phenotypes. Proposals for genes to enter late-onset phenotyping will be sought via the regular calls to the UK community for gene nominations as part of the wider IMPC effort at MRC Harwell. In line with the wider IMPC programme, all data is freely available and deposited in the IMPC database – see www.mousephenotype.org. For the future the bulk of null mutations that enter the IMPC pipeline will be generated by CRISPR/Cas9. In addition, with funding from Strategy Board, the MRC has established the new GEMM (Genome Editing Mice for Medicine) programme at MRC Harwell, utilising the CRISPR/Cas9 route to introduce additional types of alleles, such as point mutations, enabling for example investigators to introduce and analyse human point mutations. This programme underpins the high demand across the human and clinical genetics communities for access to models of rare and Mendelian disorders. Moreover, it is an important pillar in the Genomics England and Precision Medicine Initiative in the US. MRC Harwell has established a collaboration with Genomics England and it is expected that many of the mutants generated in the GEMM programme will be pivotal in the validation and analysis of loci identified through the 100,000 genomes project. In summary, Programme 1 at MGU Harwell is at the forefront of delivering mutants, disease models and data that are a critical pillar for functional genomics studies across the biomedical sciences spectrum and provide key resources for understanding the genetic bases for disease and an important tool for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

Key problems are lack of drug efficacy, and the significant metabolic disturbance that accompanies both the chronic disease state (notably accelerated cardiovascular risk) and long-term anti-inflammatory treatment. We have recently discovered that inflammation leads to reprogramming of the circadian clock. The mechanism involves destabilisation of the clock mechanism, as well as disturbance of the intricate cross-talk between components of the circadian clock (e.g. CRY, REVERB) and the glucocorticoid receptor. Reprogramming of the clock is likely an important feature of the inflammatory response at sites of inflammation, to loosen circadian control of inflammatory and metabolic pathways; however, progression to a systemic level can drive profound disturbance. To decipher how cellular clock dynamics and the clock:GR interface are altered by inflammation, we will use systems microscopy approaches (e.g. FCS, FCCS), functional imaging and RNA-SEQ on cell and tissue slice models. We will define molecular mechanisms and functional consequences of inflammatory reprogramming of the clock within foci of inflammation (lung and joint). To achieve this we will use novel in vivo imaging, with time series RNA-SEQ and metabolomics. This generates highly dimensional data, to which computational analyses can be used to build predictive causation models. We will extend these studies to investigate how localised sites of inflammation can disrupt the liver metabolic/circadian processes. These studies will identify pathways of destructive or emergent rhythms, which will be tested pharmacologically or genetically (using AAV delivery of CRISPR/Cas9). Finally, we will investigate how basal and disease-induced rhythmicity can be capitalised on for timed delivery of anti-inflammatory drugs, with the goal of optimizing therapeutic index.

Glucocorticoid signalling lies at the heart of many of these processes, but how the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) engages effector mechanisms remains unclear. We discovered metadherin is required for some, but not all actions of the GR, and that this interaction is pronounced within the liver, with a target gene ontology of lipid metabolism. To define metadherin action and modification of GR function we will: 1. Use mass spectrometry and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to define post-translational state, trafficking dynamics of GR, and GR:metadherin interaction under normal conditions and following metadherin disruption. We will validate GR modification using CRISPR engineered cells, and ascribe function using target gene expression measurements. 2. Metadherin serves as a protein scaffold, and in addition to our discovery of its interaction with GR, other metadherin client proteins include kinases and LXR. To reveal mechanisms of MTDH-mediated GR modification, we will determine the metadherin interactome, including potential effector kinases in livers from control and obese animals. 3. As metadherin regulates GR recruitment to the genome in vitro, and enhancer activation in response to glucocorticoid in vivo, we will map the GR cistrome in the liver in response to energy excess, and determine how metadherin regulates this action. Emerging mechanisms will be tested in primary hepatocytes recovered from wild type and metadherin null livers. 4. The physiological consequences of metadherin disruption on liver energy metabolism will be measured using hepatocyte metadherin null mice. We will use chronic glucocorticoid or high fat challenges, and measure lipid synthesis, oxidation, and export.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	338476.0	GBP
11	Professor Christopher Scott	Queen's University Belfast	None	2018-09-24	2021-09-23	Characterisation of the protease CTSS as a novel therapeutic target in TNBC	TNBCs are aggressive, difficult to treat breast cancers, which are associated with a poor survival. We have shown that CTSS expression is associated with TNBC and that its expression is regulated by the key TNBC driver, BRCA1. This proposal will examine CTSS as a therapeutic target in TNBC. We hypothesize that the induction of CTSS enhances the tumourigenic phenotype of TNBC and mediates key hallmarks of tumourigenesis such as invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. Aims: 1) Determine the specific phenotypic effect of CTSS in TNBC tumour cells. 2) Examine the impact of CTSS on TNBC tumour growth and metastasis using syngeneic in vivo tumour models. 3) Investigate CTSS expression in clinical samples and its association with tumour phenotype and clinical outcomes. Techniques and Methodology: We will investigate the role of CTSS in TNBC cell lines through its genetic ablation using CRISPR technology. These CTSS CRISPR lines will be subjected to a range of cell based tumour assays to determine which phenotypic effects of TNBC are mediated by CTSS. The CTSS CRISPR cell lines will then be used in syngeneic tumour models to examine the role of CTSS in primary tumour development and metastasis. Using flow cytometry and immunohistochemical analysis, we will also evaluate the impact of CTSS on the recruitment of immune cells to the tumour. Finally we will examine the clinical significance of our findings by interrogating TNBC tissue microarrays and dissecting the correlation with clinical outcome. Impact on breast cancer research: This project will allow the validation of CTSS as a therapeutic target in TNBC. TNBC is a heterogenous disease and all patients are currently treated with the same chemotherapy cocktail with limited clinical benefit. It is imperative that new targeted treatment strategies are developed, if the prognosis for these patients is to improve.	Breast Cancer Now	PhD	None	None

Kaposi's Sarcoma often leads to life-threatening complications in immunocompromised, particularly HIV-infected individuals. Like other herpesviruses, infection with KSHV is persistent and lifelong, with the virus remaining latent with occasional reactivations. KSHV must therefore remodel the host cell proteome to enable its lifestyle: in latent infection, changes are particularly related to angiogenesis and cell proliferation, while upon reactivation the virus targets host immune molecules to evade recognition from the host immune system. In a preliminary proteomic analysis we identified a number of novel KSHV targets, suggesting that our understanding of KSHV-induced pathogenesis and viral immune evasion strategies are far from complete. Here we propose to apply quantitative proteomic approaches to gain a comprehensive and unbiased overview of how KSHV remodels the host cell proteome in latency and the temporal changes that occur upon viral reactivation. We will initially focus on endothelial cells and then examine B cells, two physiologically relevant cell types for KSHV infection. We will use a novel KSHV genome-wide CRISPR library screening approach to identify the viral genes responsible for the observed phenotypic cellular changes and to understand their mechanism of action. We will assess the impact of these changes on the maintenance of virus latency, the ability of the virus to manipulate the host immune system, and KSHV-induced pathogenesis. Our goal is to generate and disseminate important findings and knowledge about infection with KSHV. This will stimulate further research in this area, and in the longer term will inform the design of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of KSHV-associated disease.

13	Professor Paul Lehner	University of Cambridge	None	2018-08-01	2023-08-01	Viral silencing and immune evasion pathways	Studying how viruses manipulate their host cell machinery provides insight into both viral function and cellular regulation. Invasion by viral DNA threatens cellular integrity and therefore needs to be detected and suppressed. As the default cellular response is to silence incoming DNA, how do viruses subvert and exploit this hostile environment to their advantage? Our identification of the ‘Human Silencing Hub’ (HUSH) as a novel epigenetic transcriptional repressor complex, responsible for silencing newly integrated retroviruses, has motivated us to further investigate chromatin regulation of viral infection. We wish to: (i) Understand how HUSH silences newly integrated viral DNA. (ii) Determine how lentiviruses antagonize chromatin-mediated repression and identify shared mechanisms by which unrelated, non-integrated viruses counteract silencing. (iii) Understand how and why the lentiviral-Vif accessory protein manipulates the host cell phosphoproteome. To help address these questions we have developed and optimised powerful genetic and proteomic screening technologies. Repurposing CRISPR-Cas9 will enable RNA-guided genome manipulations, including selection of informative point mutants and isolation of DNA sequence-specific regulatory proteins. Together these approaches provide a discovery platform to determine how repressive heterochromatin is established and maintained, how viruses manipulate their chromatin environment and ultimately to develop new therapeutic tools to enable their eradication.

We have exploited genome editing technology to generate cell lines defective in the principle DNA damage responsive ARTs alone, or in combination. Using this unique set of reagents we have identified exciting and novel redundancy between ARTs in resolving DNA damage during S-phase. We will build on this work using genome editing technology, in combination with cutting edge biochemical and cell based assays, to define how the ARTs PARP1 and PARP2 regulate these processes. These approaches will also be extended to characterising a novel ART we have uncovered that allows cells deficient in PARP1 and PARP2 to tolerate DNA damage. Using state of the art screening facilities in Oxford, we will perform a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 based screen to identify novel genes and pathways that when disrupted suppress or enhance the sensitivity of PARP-deficient cells to DNA damage. Given inhibition of ARTs is being exploited to treat homologous recombination-defective tumours, we will assess how disruption of these genes impacts on these events.

16	Professor Nicholas Lakin	University of Oxford	Biochemistry	2017-11-01	2020-10-31	Defining the function of histone ADP-ribosylation in DNA repair and genome integrity	We address three outstanding questions regarding ADP-ribosylation of histones in regulation of double strand break (DSB) repair: a) Which histones are modified in response to DSBs in vivo and at what sites? b) What is the consequence of defective histone ADP-ribosylation on DSB repair? c) What factors interact with ADP-ribosylated histones and how do they regulate DNA repair in humans? A major bottle-neck for the ADP-ribosylation field is the lack of an experimental model in which ADP-ribosylation sites can be mutated at endogenous histone loci to decipher the molecular basis of how these modifications regulate DNA repair. The ability to manipulate histone genes in Dictyostelium offers a unique platform to address these questions. Established mass spectrometry (MS) approaches will identify specific sites on Dictyostelium histones ADP-ribosylated in response to DSBs in vivo. Gene replacement technology will introduce mutations at these sites identified by MS into endogenous histone genes, to generate histone ADP-ribosylation defective strains. The ability of these strains to perform DSB repair will be assessed using standard assays including plasmid integration assays to determine NHEJ and HR efficiencies, sensitivity to DNA damage, enrichment of repair factors at damage sites. These strains offer a rigorously controlled platform to identify factors that interact with ADP-ribosylated histones, which can then be extended to humans. Immunoprecipitation of nucleosome complexes from wild-type and histone ADP-ribosylation defective strains will identify factors that specifically interact with ADP-ribosylated histones by comparative MS. The orthologues of novel proteins identified in Dictyostelium will be verified by enrichment at DSBs in human cells, disrupted by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, and the functional consequences on human DSB repair assessed using standard assays, including repair efficiencies, enrichment of repair factors at DSBs etc.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	397181.0	GBP

This has provided an initial experimental framework, and testable predictions for extrinsic and intrinsic factors needed for further development of PGCs. PGC specific reporter cell lines will provide development-monitoring assays for advanced PGCs by high-throughput live cell imaging. Long-term culture with hourly quantitative information of the fluorescence activation allows for simultaneous testing of 576 conditions. We will screen for cytokines and small compounds to stimulate development of PGCs, using the candidates identified by bioinformatic modeling, complemented by unbiased screening with commercial compound libraries, including small molecules to lower the epigenetic barriers for development. For intrinsic factors, we will focus on transcriptional factors that are specifically activated sequentially in vivo PGCs. We will conduct co-culture of nascent PGCs with human/porcine gonadal or Sertoli cells to provide a favorable niche, combined with extrinsic and/or intrinsic approaches to increase the probability of finding the best conditions for PGC development. Our immediate aim is combine all the information to generate equivalent of ~Wk10 PGCs in culture, which covers a period of significant epigenetic program leading to comprehensive erasure of DNA methylation. These PGCs will be compared bioinformatically with in vivo gonadal counterparts, gametes and seminoma. We aim to understand the overall mechanisms that regulate PGC development, together with the mechanisms of germ cell programming, as well as causes of disorders, by using patient specific iPSCs and gene modifications. We will also perform global gene inhibition and activation screening with CRISPR/Cas9. When appropriate, we will collaborate on some aspects, for example on the mitochondrial bottleneck and purification in early PGCs.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	637331.0	GBP

Notably, a conserved long non-coding RNA axis is co-located with these miRNA (miR-143HG and miR-145HG). In preliminary data, we have assessed expression and regulation of each variant (by RNAseq and qRT-PCR validation) and demonstrated splice-specific transcript expression in primary pulmonary artery vascular smooth muscle cells. Further, manipulation of the lncRNA, either by viral-mediated overexpression or siRNA-mediated knockdown, regulates the expression of miR-143 and miR-145 and their downstream targets, thus creating a SMC-axis for gene regulation in the vessel wall. In this application, we interrogate the control of this miRNA cluster by co-located lncRNA, both in vitro and in a novel CRISPR/Cas mouse in vivo. We further use human samples and iPSC modelling of patient samples to collectively define the importance of this axis in the setting of pulmonary hypertension&lt;/P&gt;	British Heart Foundation	Project Grant	207336.0	GBP

It is well established that altered patterns of early growth, as a consequence of both in utero under-nutrition and over-nutrition are associated with increased risk of metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and obesity in later life. These conditions are major health care issues of the 21stcentury in both the developed and developing world. Therefore, understanding mechanisms by which these conditions arise and which could therefore be targeted within intervention and prevention strategies could have a major impact. Although there is strong evidence, from human and animal studies that early diet, plays an important role in mediating these relationships, the precise molecular mechanisms by which diet during critical periods of development programmes metabolism and consequently influences long-term health remain poorly defined. Permanent changes in epigenetic regulation of gene expression have emerged as an important contributing mechanism. Our previous studies demonstrated that promotor-enhancer interactions and small non-coding RNAs such as miRNAs represent key nodes of epigenetic regulation leading to modulation of expression of complex gene networks. In the current proposal, using adipose tissue from well-established mouse models of developmental programming in combination with human biopsy material, we will apply state of the art epigenetic technology including promoter-capture Hi-C with complex bioinformatic analysis, to identify changes in 4D chromatin structure that mediate programming effects. Furthermore, we will establish if non-coding RNAs represent particular “hot spots” within the genome for such regulation. We will define the function of these non-coding RNAs and promotor-enhancer interactions in vitro using a combination of primary cell cultures and adipocyte cell lines and applying CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology. Our studies will therefore define novel programming mechanisms that are conserved between rodents and humans. Any programmed epigenetic changes that we identify could, in the future, be used prognostically, diagnostically and therapeutically to target individuals at risk of metabolic disease resulting from suboptimal early life programming. The findings could therefore help combat the growing burden of complex diseases such as type 2 diabetes.	Medical Research Council	Unit	1439000.0	GBP

21	Professor Chris Murphy	University of Oxford	None	2015-09-01	2017-08-31	Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to identify therapeutic targets of microRNAs	MicroRNAs show great therapeutic promise and clinical trials are underway to treat a variety of human diseases. However, since a single microRNA can (and does) target multiple genes, for both efficacy and safety concerns there is a clear need to identify and selectively affect only the relevant (beneficial) target sites. No current approaches can do this and we will address this unmet need through the use of state-of-the-art genome editing technologies. To this end we have developed a very potent strategy using CRISPR/Cas9 mediated homology-directed repair for the assessment of microRNA response element (MRE) activity in human cells. In the current study such an approach will be applied to human chondrocytes to enable identification of endogenously active microRNA binding sites in phenotypically important genes. We believe these MREs, rather than the microRNAs themselves, to be the most appropriate targets for future clinical trials.	Versus Arthritis	Project Grant	220825.07	GBP

However, we now need to understand how mutations in the identified genes contribute to epilepsy and to translate this into potential therapies. This project will address these issues by focusing on STXBP1 - the second most commonly mutated gene in catastrophic infantile epilepsies. Our principal aims are to characterise the functional effects of disease-causing mutations in STXBP1 and to search for genetic modifiers that can ameliorate the consequences of those mutations. This will involve using CRISPR to replace the single copy of the orthologous Caenorhabditis elegans unc-18 gene with wild-type and epilepsy-associated mutant human STXBP1. These humanised animal models will be analysed for alterations in neurotransmission and behaviour, and for genetic suppressor screening. Biochemical interactions of the corresponding human recombinant proteins with functionally important synaptic protein binding partners will be analysed in vitro. Overall, this multi-disciplinary project will illuminate how genetic variation in STXBP1 causes functional changes that lead to epilepsy and may reveal compensatory cellular pathways that could represent novel targets for antiepileptic drug discovery	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	390206.0	GBP
23	Professor David Ray	University of Oxford	RDM OCDEM	2018-08-01	2022-09-30	Inflammatory therapeutics and the role of the circadian clock	Chronic, unresolving inflammation plays a major role in human disease, yet remains a therapeutic challenge. Key problems are lack of drug efficacy, and the significant metabolic disturbance that accompanies both the chronic disease state (notably accelerated cardiovascular risk) and long-term anti-inflammatory treatment. We have recently discovered that inflammation leads to reprogramming of the circadian clock. The mechanism involves destabilisation of the clock mechanism, as well as disturbance of the intricate cross-talk between components of the circadian clock (e.g. CRY, REVERB) and the glucocorticoid receptor. Reprogramming of the clock is likely an important feature of the inflammatory response at sites of inflammation, to loosen circadian control of inflammatory and metabolic pathways; however, progression to a systemic level can drive profound disturbance. To decipher how cellular clock dynamics and the clock:GR interface are altered by inflammation, we will use systems microscopy approaches (e.g. FCS, FCCS), functional imaging and RNA-SEQ on cell and tissue slice models. We will define molecular mechanisms and functional consequences of inflammatory reprogramming of the clock within foci of inflammation (lung and joint). To achieve this we will use novel in vivo imaging, with time series RNA-SEQ and metabolomics. This generates highly dimensional data, to which computational analyses can be used to build predictive causation models. We will extend these studies to investigate how localised sites of inflammation can disrupt the liver metabolic/circadian processes. These studies will identify pathways of destructive or emergent rhythms, which will be tested pharmacologically or genetically (using AAV delivery of CRISPR/Cas9). Finally, we will investigate how basal and disease-induced rhythmicity can be capitalised on for timed delivery of anti-inflammatory drugs, with the goal of optimizing therapeutic index.

24	Professor Robin Choudhury	Oxford, University of	Radcliffe Department of Medicine	2018-11-01	2021-10-31	The role of endothelial cell derived extracellular vesicles in monocyte mobilisation and activation in acute myocardial infarction	Following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) the heart is infiltrated by monocytes, which mediate further damage. Such monocytes are rapidly mobilised from the spleen and undergo transcriptional activation en route to the injured myocardium. The precise mechanisms that induce monocyte mobilisation and transcriptional activation are not known, but our laboratory showed a role for extracellular vesicles (EV). EV, which carry proteins, microRNA (miRNA), and mRNA, can effect rapid cell-to-cell communication. We have shown that: total plasma EV number increases after AMI in mice and in humans; that the increase in plasma EV is largely accounted for by endothelial cell (EC)-derived EV that bear VCAM-1; that these plasma EV are enriched for several miRNA and injected EC-EV localise to the spleen where they mobilise monocytes. Our previous studies were in unselected EV, but the changes in number of VCAM-1+ EV and the isolation of EC-associated miR126 both point towards an important role for EC-derived EV. Therefore, we will (I) elucidate the factors, which increase EC-EV generation after injury, (II) establish the biologically active signatures (proteins and miRNA) enriched in the EC-EV fraction after injury and (III) manipulate EC-EV using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing techniques to generate autologous bioactive EV with therapeutic potential.

25	Professor Malcolm Dunlop	University of Edinburgh	None	2016-01-01	2020-12-31	Integrative genomics in colorectal cancer susceptibility: developing risk reducing interventions through understanding biology	Background Cancer of the large bowel (colorectyal cancer - CRC) is one of the most common cancers (45,000 cases annually) and results in the death of over 40% of those who develop the disease. We maintain that the disease is largely preventable. The proposed research programme aims to reduce incidence and death from this common cancer killer. Aims 1. Elucidate the genetic architecture of CRC risk and gene-environment interactions 2. Define the molecular perturbations responsible for CRC risk 3. Use such new understanding to develop interventions to reduce CRC risk and mortality. Methods We will continue to build the wealth of patient sample resources that we have assembled linked with clinical, pathological, demographic and survival outcome data. Informed by GWAS/EXOME genotyping data, we will perform "Next-Generation" sequencing (exome/whole genome) in genetically enriched patient groups. We will use whole genome sequencing to identify regulatory elements correlated with CRC risk and elucidate their functional roles by linking expression data from colorectal epithelium in CRC patients and cancer-free subjects. A prioritised gene shortlist will be interrogated using genome editing (CRISPR) approaches to explore pathogenicity and functional consequences in mice predisposed to CRC. We also aim to develop new approaches involving CRISPR targeting of genes in cultured organoids derived from patient colorectal mucosa samples with the ultimate aim of correcting deleterious genetic variants associated with CRC risk. We will investigate vitamin D as a modifiable risk factor, and potential chemopreventative agent, interacting with genotype at CRC risk loci. Genomewide GxE analysis will be conducted, integrating WGS data for regulatory elements (VDREs) with normal/tumour expression (RNAseq). In vitro studies of human colonic organoids and cell lines treated with vitamin D will complement clinical intervention studies. We will biopsy rectal mucosa in human subjects treated with vitamin D, using various functional readouts. How the results of this research will be used Our aim is to identify genes predisposing to CRC and intervene to reduce the risk imparted by genetic variation at those gene loci. We also aim to develop vitamin D prevention studies stratified by genotype. We will also further extend our published findings of GxE effects on CRC survival outcome due to interaction of vitamin D level and SNP genotypes. This highly translational programme has implications for interventions in CRC prevention, survival and risk stratification in population screening programmes.

The FACSAria Fusion is a highly flexible and advanced flow cell based flow cytometer that can perform multi-parameter four-way sorting. The Aria flow cell-based detection method provides greater fluorescence sensitivity than alternative stream-in air based cell sorters, which is critical for many of the proposed studies. We have requested funds for a four laser (blue/red/violet/yellow-green) 18-parameter instrument to enable high dimension analysis of the cells during sorting. The violet laser will enable use of highly sensitive brilliant violet fluorochromes and the yellow-green laser will allow greater use of multiple fluorescent proteins. The instrument can also perform single cell index sorting into 384-well plates, which will enable our research teams to undertake single cell transcriptomics projects and sort CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene edited cells. The instrument is fully integrated into the biosafety cabinet enabling work to be undertaken with primary patient samples and hazard group 2 pathogens. Maintenance, assisting new users and staff training are essential for such a complex instrument, we have therefore requested funding for an experienced grade 7 manager for a 4-year period.

27	Dr McCaughan	University of Cambridge	None	2015-10-01	2018-09-30	An organotypic model of bronchial dysplasia	We have developed a novel organotypic (OTC) model of bronchial dysplasia / early lung cancer. In this system, immortalised normal human bronchial epithelial cells are grown at the air-liquid interface on a collagen matrix with embedded fibroblasts. In OTC there is a clear phenotype in cells in which the activation of putative oncogenes at the air-liquid interface recapitulates a histological phenotype consistent with human bronchial dysplasia / early lung cancer. In vivo, multiple potentially important genotypes may co-exist and influence the cellular phenotypes. We have introduced complexity into our model by combining two genetic lesions, which leads to a more marked phenotype. For this studentship we propose two main scientific objectives. 1) To perform a medium throughput functional/phenotypic screen of an extended library of small molecule inhibitors in an in vitro model of bronchial dysplasia The student will first recapitulate the current OTC experiments and optimise them for a 96- transwell format (rather than current 12 well format) more suitable for screening therapeutic compounds. A 384-compound commercially available library that targets multiple key signal transduction pathways and comprises all classes of known anticancer compounds will be used. The impact of these compounds on the dysplastic phenotype will be interrogated. 2) To extend the existing in vitro OTC model to cover more complex genotypes and assess the impact of these changes on hits from Aim 1) Using existing lentiviral protocols and the recently introduced CRISPR technology further/other genetic lesions will be introduced into the same immortalised cells with the aim of producing the more complex genotypes. Further, the microenvironment will be manipulated. The impact of these refinements on the development of dysplasia and the effect of anticancer compounds will be interrogated.

28	Dr McCaughan	University of Cambridge	None	2018-11-01	2020-10-31	A novel murine model of squamous lung cancer	Squamous lung cancer (SQC) has been significantly more challenging to model than adenocarcinoma and progress in understanding its pathobiology and developing targeted therapeutics has been slow. To address this unmet need we have developed a novel orthotopic model of SQC. We have refined/optimised a protocol for the expansion of primary murine tracheobronchial epithelial cells (mTBECs). We have optimised the genetic manipulation of primary mTBECs via multilocus CRISPR and lentiviral transduction so that clinically relevant genotypes can be rapidly recreated in primary mTBECs. Further, we use inducible constructs so that genes of interest can be turned on and off at will throughout the natural history of the disease. The manipulated mTBECs are injected into the right lung of a syngeneic animal. Recipient mice therefore have an intact immune system and develop localised disease with the potential to metastasise. We have demonstrated in pilot data that this approach generates early murine SQC lesions within 3 weeks and large invasive tumours at around 4 months in wild type immunocompetent animals. This model can revolutionise the field - and lead to a dramatic reduction in the number of mice required to perform experiments; as well as refinements that reduce the ASPA Severity limit to Moderate and remove the need for toxin administration. Our scientific aims are to characterise the natural history of SQC in this novel syngeneic murine orthotopic model, to validate the model as being both reproducible and directly relevant to the human disease. Further, we will use luciferase-based imaging to ensure longitudinal studies on individual animals are feasible. Second we will apply the model to efficiently address key basic and translational issues: the necessity of a driving oncogene for SQC maintenance; the potential to use AKT inhibition for SQC chemoprevention; and a demonstration that it will have utility for studying the tumour immune microenvironment.

Glucocorticoid signalling lies at the heart of many of these processes, but how the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) engages effector mechanisms remains unclear. We discovered metadherin is required for some, but not all actions of the GR, and that this interaction is pronounced within the liver, with a target gene ontology of lipid metabolism. To define metadherin action and modification of GR function we will: 1. Use mass spectrometry and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to define post-translational state, trafficking dynamics of GR, and GR:metadherin interaction under normal conditions and following metadherin disruption. We will validate GR modification using CRISPR engineered cells, and ascribe function using target gene expression measurements. 2. Metadherin serves as a protein scaffold, and in addition to our discovery of its interaction with GR, other metadherin client proteins include kinases and LXR. To reveal mechanisms of MTDH-mediated GR modification, we will determine the metadherin interactome, including potential effector kinases in livers from control and obese animals. 3. As metadherin regulates GR recruitment to the genome in vitro, and enhancer activation in response to glucocorticoid in vivo, we will map the GR cistrome in the liver in response to energy excess, and determine how metadherin regulates this action. Emerging mechanisms will be tested in primary hepatocytes recovered from wild type and metadherin null livers. 4. The physiological consequences of metadherin disruption on liver energy metabolism will be measured using hepatocyte metadherin null mice. We will use chronic glucocorticoid or high fat challenges, and measure lipid synthesis, oxidation, and export.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	686327.0	GBP

In this proposal we shall investigate the presence or absence of the MSL in L. infantum in Brazil, as this could inform on whether a new clinical trial with stratified patients might be viable and whether a PCR-based diagnostic test for the MSL should be developed. The molecular basis by which the MSL confers susceptibility of the parasite to miltefosine will be investigated. We will also study the environmental basis for the loss of the MSL in Brazilian L. infantum. Sandflies, the insect vector that transmits Leishmania, take food from plants. We shall test the hypothesis that Brazilian trees of the family Fabaceae fed on by the sandfly contain a natural product(s) that selects for loss of the MSL via genome rearrangement in the parasite. Identification of the plant(s) and natural product (s) involved would help define the range of MSL-containing L. infantum in Brazil, though Geographic information system (GIS) mapping of the specific natural product-containing trees. To achieve this we shall 1. Determine the prevalence of the MSL in Leishmania infantum circulating in Brazil by PCR analysis of DNA taken from infected phlebotomine flies, VL patients and domestic dogs (zoonotic reservoir). Also, to identify plants on which infected phlebotomine flies have fed. 2. Identify the molecular mechanism by which the MSL confers susceptibility to miltefosine by CRISPR-Cas9 directed genetic modification of L. infantum. 3. Test if there is a statistical association between natural products identified in specific plants and loss of MSL across geographical regions. This will combine GIS data on plant locations with identification of miltefosine-like natural products by mass spectrometry.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	556635.0	GBP

II.	The experimental paths are very different, due to diverse methodologies of the structural, chemical and cell biology. Receptors. The structural studies in York (IR-A,IR-B,IGF-1R) are re-focused due to gains achieved in the current MRC grant. Receptors and their constructs will be expressed only in the baculovirus system (yielding currently more reproducible/better crystals). Complexes with insulin/IGF1/2 will be expanded for highly specific analogues to decipher their structural signatures. Hormone receptor affinities will be evaluated by ITC & Novo Nordisk proprietary assays. TK protein expression/structural work will be carried in Cork, while TK crystal studies will be done with York. Frequent BAG beam access to DLS (Didcot), and remote data collection are well established. The exploitation of the larger constructs (i.e. IR ectodomains) by cryoEM is initiated, and it will be continued. However, when suitable grids:constructs are established, the cryoEM work will form a separate grant application. Hormones. Analogues of insulin, IGF1/2 will be semi-/fully-synthesised or expressed in E.coli; IOCB has key expertise here. The established wide range of analogue assays (receptor affinities and autophosphorylation, cell viability etc.), will be expanded for IGF-2R receptor essays; unique radio-active (125I, Eu) IGF2 tracers will be produced. All analogues with novel properties will be used in structural studies with the receptors, and optimised further in novel human muscle/fat-tissue cell-based platforms developed here. Cells. CRISPR-Cas9 will be used to knockout all IR isoforms individually (and IGF-1R), creating a novel insulin unresponsive cell line. This line will be transfected to express specific receptor(s) profile, then the insulin/analogues responsiveness of these cell lines will be characterised with respect to i) glucose transport, ii) the proportion of HA-GLUT4-GFP expressed/present at the cell surface, iii) IR downstream effectors activation.

35	Dr Simon Bullock	MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology	None	2004-01-01	2100-12-31	Molecular cell biology of cytoskeletal transport	Cytoplasmic transport of organelles and macromolecules by molecular motors is of fundamental importance for the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity. In addition, defective motor transport is implicated in neurological diseases and pathogenic viruses and bacteria frequently exploit cellular transport routes. The challenge of studying microtubule-based transport is that movements are driven by large macromolecular assemblies, with a single cargo often bound simultaneously by multiple opposite polarity dynein and kinesin motors. Using a tractable model system in Drosophila embryos we have shed light on mechanisms responsible for polarised sorting of specific mRNA molecules by microtubule motors. We have revealed molecular links between localising mRNAs and dynein and used novel in vitro motility assays to show that long distance movement of the motor is activated by mRNA localisation signals. Recently, together with Andrew Carter’s lab at the LMB, we have used purified mammalian proteins to show that the adaptor protein BicD is a key factor in switching on dynein processivity. We have also elucidated the mechanisms of dynein regulation by Lissencephaly-1 and mRNA localisation signals. We have also been investigating how cargo transport is orchestrated in neurons using the intact Drosophila nervous system as a model. We recently established a novel imaging assay in the adult wing and are using it to study the relationship between axonal transport and the healthy lifespan of neurons. We have developed and distributed optimised tools for CRISPR genome engineering in Drosophila, and are using these in several of our own projects. Our long-term plans are to combine genetics, cell biology, structural studies and single molecule assays to understand the key processes that control sorting of cargos and pathogens by motors. This should have therapeutic relevance; for example, it may be possible to target drugs to discrete regions of the cell to maximise their efficacy or to develop agents that stimulate motor activity in order to alleviate problems associated with defective transport in neurodegenerative diseases.

36	Dr Ingo Greger	MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology	None	2003-10-01	2100-12-31	AMPA receptor biogenesis and allosteric control	AMPA receptors (AMPARs), glutamate-gated cation channels, are main mediators of excitatory neurotransmission and are central to synaptic plasticity, a process underlying learning. AMPARs are also essential for brain development and their dysfunction contributes to various neurological diseases, rendering them a potential drug target. AMPARs are composed of four pore-forming (core) subunits and various types of auxilliay subunits, in various combinations. The composition of the AMPAR comlex is essential for post-synaptic signal processing as it determines: signalling properties, trafficking to/from synapses and synaptic positioning of the receptor. Our research aims to unravel mechanisms underlying AMPAR biogenesis, receptor organisation, and principles of allosteric regulation. We built on this information to investigate rules of receptor operation at synapses in the brain to ultimately understand its central role in information storage and learning. The bulk (~80%) of the receptor’s mass is extracellular (facing the synaptic cleft) and is composed of two domains - the ligand-binding domain (LBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD), which are connected by a flexible linker. We showed that the sequence-diverse NTD is essential for receptor assembly and for anchoring at postsynaptic sites and that deletion of the NTD impedes synaptic potentiation. We hypothesise that the NTD provides a (subunit-selective) synaptic anchor that positions the receptor opposite presynaptic glutamate release sites and that this process is essential for efficient signal transmission and synaptic potentiation. Inherent to this model is the unique conformational freedom of the modular AMPAR extracellular region, permitting NTD interactions with (to be identified) synaptic cleft proteins. We have observed conformational dynamics in coarse-grained simulations, by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo EM), and by peptide mapping (where we detect interactions between the membrane-distal NTD with the membrane proximal TARP). We aim to characterise structural dynamics of AMPAR/auxiliary subunit combinations predominating at hippocampal CA1 synapses (a well characterised, plastic model synapse) by single particle cryo-EM and are aiming to isolate NTD interactors in biochemical screens. Results from these efforts will be studied in an intact CA1 neuronal circuitry, where we utilize our in vitro data to selectively manipulate both receptor conformations and expression profiles of NTD-interacting proteins using CRISPR. We are also implementing 3D-stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (3D-STORM) in brain tissue, which will allow us to follow AMPAR dynamics (and NTD-mediated positioning) at synapses undergoing potentiation with high precision.

Vertebrate size is established based on total cell number generated during development. Despite the 75 million-fold difference in size between the smallest and largest mammals, the mechanisms for this remain to be determined. This proposal seeks insight into how total cell number is determined in both pathological and physiological states. Over the last decade our study of extreme growth disorders has identified 18 new human disease genes. We established these encode core components of the cell-cycle machinery, providing cellular and developmental insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of these disorders. From our starting point of human disease, this approach also revealed novel genome instability genes informing fundamental research of basic biological processes. Still, the molecular basis for over half of individuals with microcephalic dwarfism remains unknown. This proposal will break new ground through the comprehensive application of Whole Genome Sequencing to our patient cohort to achieve screen saturation via identification of coding and non-coding mutations. Forward-genetic genome-wide CRISPR screens in developmentally relevant cell and organoid systems will also be developed to define key cellular processes impacting human growth. Beyond these ‘discovery science’ approaches, cellular and model organism techniques will be used to define the mechanistic basis for human disease caused by mutations in core replication machinery and key epigenetic factors. To extend prior work on pathophysiological mechanisms, we aim to establish a subset of microcephalic dwarfism genes as growth regulators, and thereby further define when and how organism size is determined. These studies will link essential cellular machinery governing proliferation with human disease, identify novel genome-stability factors and may yield insights into the developmental regulation of mammalian size.

Yet, on average only 37 new drugs are launched annually before undergoing risk-benefit analysis. Those posing health risks receive ‘adverse drugs reaction (ADR) notifications’ or ‘black box warnings’. When Seldane was ‘black boxed’, sales decreased by £200M. Withdrawal from market occurs in severe cases; 462 drugs were discontinued between 1953-2013 (=$396-650Bn), with unexpected cardio-toxicity the leading cause. Better methods and models are needed to validate potential drugs prior to animal testing, thereby minimising animal welfare, financial and patient safety issues. Our recent publications (2018) describe NC3Rsfunded work on the use of precision genetic engineering to develop stem cell models of genetic heart disease, specifically the prevalent and life-threatening condition of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Often ADRs or black box warnings arise because drugs interfere with each other or are complicated by underlying health issues. Of the top 200 drugs, 81 carry black box warnings and 82 carry ADRs for the cardiovascular system. Working with the Medicines Discovery Catapult, we will determine whether stem cell-derived heart cells can predict drug safety/toxicity, and whether this profile changes in healthy or diseased context. Successful project delivery would allow further funding to be sourced to progress the technology as a tool to assist routine cardiotoxicity profiling, ADR or black box labelling. A 10% reduction in animal use would save ~35,000 animals, money and patient lives.

39	Dr Lucy Davison	University of Cambridge	None	2015-08-03	2016-08-02	The role of the DEXI gene in susceptibility to type 1 diabetes	Genome-wide association studies have revealed many novel genes associated with risk of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and study of such genes offers an important and untapped route to discovering novel pathways for therapeutic intervention. The expression of DEXI, a gene with no paralogue in the human genome, is correlated with risk of T1D at the 16p13.13 region. Increased DEXI expression in monocytes is associated with protection from T1D, however DEXI's specific function remains unknown. Our in vitro work with DEXI manipulation in monocytic cell lines suggests that DEXI encodes a protein which impacts on cytokine responses to external stimuli. We have also generated the first DEXI monoclonal antibody so are now uniquely poised to investigate the function of DEXI effectively at a whole organism level. DEXI is highly conserved between humans and mice. We will test the hypothesis that reduction of Dexi expression using cutting-edge CRISPR technology in a spontaneous diabetes mouse model, the Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) mouse, will increase the incidence and accelerate the development of diabetes. Evaluation of the immune system of such mice will also provide insight into the function of the Dexi protein and potentially reveal novel T1D pathways and targets for intervention.

The specific questions of the functional impact of this gene in the context of the immune system and the microbiome will be addressed. Objectives: The first objectives of this study are to evaluate the impact of DEXI knockout on diabetes suceptibility, the microbiome and the function of the immune system. Additionally, this project will generate novel monoclonal antibodies to facilitate study of DEXI protein across species, including humans. This project will also endeavour to evaluate the client-owned domestic pet dog, which also suffers from spontaneous diabetes, as a potential spontaneous model for study of the microbiome in T1D. Methodology: Gene knockdown has already been achieved using CRISPR-Cas9 technology in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) model. Immunological and phenotypic studies will include evaluation of cytokine production and activation status in response to a range of stimuli and single cell RNA-Seq of selected cell types. Microbiome analysis will be undertaken on DNA extracted from faeces in the NOD and in spontaneously diabetic pet dogs undergoing veterinary treatment. Microbiome transfer experiments will also be undertaken in the NOD model in the presence and absence of Dexi. Scientific and medical opportunities: Discovery of novel pathways in autoimmune disease susceptibility offers new opportunities for therapeutic or preventative intervention.

The genetic cause is expansion of CTG repeats in the 3&rsquo;-UTR of the DMPK gene, which leads to RNA toxicity, nuclear foci and altered gene splicing. Increasing repeat number (50-2000) correlates with disease severity but inversely correlates with age of onset. While cell and animal-based models have helped understand molecular pathophysiology of DM1, non-physiological expression levels of DMPK transgenes and species differences mean relevance to the human condition has been questioned. Few data exist on pathophysiology of functioning human heart cells. Using our experience in hiPSC, we will investigate pathophysiology of DM1 in human cardiomyocytes to improve risk stratification and evaluation of emerging treatments. Stability of repeats will be determined during reprogramming of somatic cell types from DM1 patients and differentiation of hiPSCs to cardiomyocytes. Isogenic controls will be produced by CRISPR targeted correction of DM1 hiPSC lines. These resources will allow the molecular, structural and functional impact of DM1 to be investigated in hiPSCcardiomyocytes. This will provide new ways to stratify patient risk and evaluate emerging experimental treatments for DM1, including antisense oligonucleotides and small molecules (e.g. protein inhibitors, antibiotics &amp; kinase inhibitors, with the latter identified by the Brook lab).&lt;/P&gt;	British Heart Foundation	Project Grant	299933.0	GBP
42	Professor Colin Bingle	University of Sheffield	Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease	2017-01-01	2017-12-31	Gene editing in the middle ear: Gene deletion at will for the study of Otitis Media.	The middle ear is an air-filled cavity, containing the three smallest bones in the body (the ossicles), which are crucial for hearing. The cavity is lined with a layer of cells, called an epithelium, which contains multiple types of cells that provide protection for the cavity. The epithelium surrounding the middle ear is the target of pathogens, such as bacteria, that cause middle ear infections (known collectively as otitis media). This is one of the most common infections of childhood – by the age of 3, over four out of every five children will have had a middle ear infection – and there are over 700 million cases each year across the world. It is the most common reason for prescribing antibiotics, and one of the leading causes of childhood surgery. Although in most cases, the infection is temporary and clears up relatively straightforwardly, if the infection becomes chronic (called chronic otitis media with effusion, or COME), it can cause permanent damage to the ear, and permanent hearing loss – over 100 million people worldwide are thought to have hearing loss caused by otitis media. COME is thought to be caused by an out-of-control inflammatory response to a trigger such as a pathogen, and this response causes changes to the epithelium itself – including an increase in the number of mucus-producing cells, which contribute to the effusion from the ear. The processes underlying these changes are not well understood – it is difficult to obtain samples of affected tissue to study. Professor Bingle and his team have recently developed a ‘model’ of the middle ear epithelium, grown in the lab from middle ear cells taken from the mouse, which will help us to better understand otitis media. The cells in this model grow at the interface between the liquid culture medium (which provides the cells with the nutrients they need to grow and develop and communicate with each other), and air – this is very similar to the way in which they grow in the middle ear, and makes this model highly relevant, as the cells develop and grow much like they do in the middle ear. One of the advantages of this model is that it will allow researchers studying otitis media to investigate the role of particular genes in the processes that lead to it. Using a new genetic engineering technology called CRISPR/Cas9, the researchers will edit one of the genes in the cells, called Foxj1, which is known to control the development of the mucus-producing cells that are implicated in otitis media (COME). This will not only demonstrate the ability to use gene editing to alter these cells to study the role of particular genes, but will also provide insight into how disrupting Foxj1 impacts on the middle ear epithelium as a whole, and the development of otitis media. This project could lead to the development of a new tool to study otitis media, and a system which can be used to test potential drugs for their ability to treat this condition, making it of great value to the research community.

Members of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) family of cytokines are often implicated in disease processes, namely the pro-inflammatory members IL-1a and IL-1b. IL-1 release from activated immune cells is regulated by a protein complex called the inflammasome. IL-1 is expressed in response to pathogen or damage associated molecular patterns (PAMPs or DAMPs) that stimulate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on cells of the innate immune system. Once expressed, pro-IL-1 remains intracellular until an additional PAMP or DAMP stimulation activates inflammasomes. Inflammasomes activate caspase-1 which in turn processes pro-IL-1 allowing release of the mature cytokine. The inflammasome most implicated in non-communicable diseases is formed by the PRR NLRP3. The NLRP3 inflammasome is also the best studied inflammasome, yet there are still large gaps in knowledge concerning its activation. We have discovered that the volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC), a Cl- channel composed of LRRC8 subunits, could be an important regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome. We now aim to verify the importance of VRAC to NLRP3-dependent inflammatory responses using a number of CRISPR based strategies to knockout the VRAC essential sub-unit LRRC8A. Knocking out LRRC8A in vitro will allow us to verify the importance of VRAC in NLRP3 inflammasome activation in response to a range of well-characterised NLRP3 activating stimuli. We will also knock out LRRC8A in macrophages specifically and demonstrate its relevance in an in vivo model of NLRP3-dependent inflammation. This, combined with our repurposing of existing medicines as VRAC inhibitors, will establish VRAC as a potential novel therapeutic target for the treatment of inflammatory disease.

Of all the human polyomaviruses BKPyV has the biggest clinical impact due to causing BK polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (BKVAN) in up to 10% of renal transplant patients, and this disease can lead to allograft loss in a high proportion of such patients. Due to a lack of effective antiviral therapies for treating BKVAN, there is a pressing need to understand the basic biology of BKPyV to develop novel therapeutics against this virus. To address this gap in understanding, we have established a CRISPR genome-wide screen for host factors required in early stages of BKPyV infection. This has uncovered specific host factors involved in endocytosis, transcription and splicing. This research will determine the importance and mechanisms of action of the identified host factors during BKPyV infection. Furthermore, these genetic screens will be expanded to encompass the entire replication cycle of this virus within renal epithelial cells to identify and characterise host pathways required for viral late gene expression, virion assembly and virus egress. Additionally, we will characterise the changes to the plasma membrane proteome of BKPyV infected cells, to gain further understanding of how this virus alters cellular secretion pathways to promote its own release, and to define biomarkers of infection. This programme of work will provide the most complete understanding of host factors required for BKPyV to establish infection, replicate and spread in primary renal cells. In addition to providing new therapeutic targets for the treatment of life threatening diseases in the immunocompromised, our work will have wide reaching implications beyond the field of polyomavirus biology as we expect to uncover new insights into cellular biological processes.

One of the key cellular mechanisms of regulating the activity of many proteins on a posttranslational timescale is through protein degradation using the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Specificity of proteolysis for any particular substrate is determined by its association with a specific E3-receptor subunit. F-box proteins are the substrate-recognition components of the E3- ubiquitin ligases. The human and mouse genome comprises 70-75 F-box proteins that are incompletely studied. The analysis of gene function in vivo is not always possible due to the lethality of knockout mouse. The experimental plan will use previously developed in vitro 3D organoid cultures to study the functions of E3s. Lentiviral gene overexpression and CRISPR/Cas genome editing will be used to modify genes in organoids. We aim; 1) to develop a new fluorescent/luminescent-based screening for knockout organoids in combination with the CRISPR/Cas system. We will apply this method to analyse loss-of-function phenotype of FBXW7-E3 enriched in intestinal stem cells. 2) We will establish large scale CRISPR/Cas-mediated mutagenesis in organoid cultures by a gRNA-expressing organoid library targeting F-box-type E3-ligases. Site-specific mutagenesis in organoids will be generated by inducible Cas9 recombinase. For an example, we will these organoids to screen E3s essential for growth, proliferation and differentiation. gRNAs in mutant clones will be sequenced and the gene responsible for the phenotype will be identified. The main objectives are: i) to establish CRISPR/Cas and fluorescent/luminescent screening system for functional genetic tools in organoid cultures ii) to understand the role of F-box-type E3-ligases. This study will provide useful genetic tools for organoid cultures and will demonstrate the efficacy of in vitro system to study gene functions. Mouse geneticists will be encouraged to use organoid cultures as the replacement for in vivo studies.

We will use transfected cells to identify RNA(s) and define binding sites at nucleotide-resolution, using a modified iCLIP protocol coupled with next generation sequencing on the MiSeq platform. After demultiplexing and removal of PCR duplicates, sequences will be aligned to the human and HIV-1 genomes. Partitioning of identified RNA(s) to the cell membrane will be investigated using biochemical techniques such as membrane flotation coupled with RT-qPCR; and microscopy techniques, involving tagging RNAs of interest with MS2 loops for visualisation by fluorescent MS2 coat protein. We will use techniques such as si/shRNA and CRISPR to investigate the effect of knockdown of these RNAs on HIV-1 assembly and infectious virion production, as well as transfection of 5'-O-methylated antisense oligonucleotides to block the RNA-MA interaction. 2) Characterising the HIV-1 gRNA-bound proteome in living cells. We will use transduced cells and an MS2-based RNA purification protocol, coupled with protein tagging with TMTsixplex labelling reagents and identification by mass spectrometry (Orbitrap Velos Pro) to identify proteins that interact with HIV-1 gRNA. Peptides will be identified and quantified using MaxQuant/Andromeda software. Proteins that specifically interact with gRNA will be knocked down to assess their effects on virus assembly. The mechanism(s) of action of positively-acting cofactors will be elucidated using a range of well-established molecular virology approaches. We will also perform pairwise comparisons of the gRNA-associated proteome in assembly permissive/non-permissive conditions to further enrich for assembly cofactors. Here, we will take advantage of the fact that murine cells are non-permissive for HIV assembly. Where functional differences between human and murine proteins are found, structure-function analyses will be undertaken to map the motifs responsible.

49	Professor Johann de Bono	Institute of Cancer Research	None	2018-10-01	2021-09-30	Identifying and validating actionable targets to block androgen receptor splicing.	BACKGROUND: Many prostate cancers remain invariably lethal, driven by continued AR signalling through constitutively active splice variants (AR-SVs) that cause endocrine therapy resistance and radioresistance due to increased non-homologous end joining DNA repair of double strand breaks. Targeting AR-SV is challenging due to the intrinsically disordered structure of the N-terminal domain. Alternative AR-SV targeting strategies are urgently needed. HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize that targeting key spliceosome components will block AR-SV generation to reverse endocrine treatment and radiation resistance. PRELIMINARY DATA: AR-SV expression is critical to castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) development and progression. BET inhibitors targeting BRD2, 3, 4, and siRNA to these proteins, block AR-SV generation despite continued expression of AR-FL, downregulating AR-SV mRNA and RNA splicing factors, including JMJD6, crucial to AR-SV generation. In parallel, orthogonal studies utilizing a targeted siRNA screen of known spliceosome components, confirmed that JMJD6 downregulation blocks AR-SV generation. Furthermore, our preliminary data indicate that JMJD6 is: A) Druggable in computer-assisted models; B) Upregulated in CRPC biopsies; and C) Associates with AR-driven transcripts in CRPC transcriptomes. AIMS: We will: A) Validate JMJD6 findings and evaluate if there are other spliceosome proteins critical to AR-SV generation; B) Confirm identified hits by targeted overexpression studies, generation of stable CRISPR knockouts and the study of patient derived xenografts (PDXs) before and after castration, and re-exposure to dihydrotestosterone after castration; C) Investigate the functional role of identified hits, including JMJD6, and elucidate hit druggability using the canSAR chemo-informatics database and through site directed mutagenesis studies of druggable target pockets, also determining through RNAseq studies their wider impact on transcription and splicing. IMPLICATIONS: We will identify druggable spliceosome proteins key to AR splicing for high throughput chemical screens to identify lead compounds for drug discovery efforts that can ultimately improve outcome from lethal mCRPC.

50	Professor Simon Reed	CARDIFF UNIVERSITY	None	2020-01-01	2022-12-31	INDUCE-seq: a novel tool for next generation risk assessment	Genotoxicity testing relies on the quantitative measurement of adverse effects, such as chromosome aberrations, micronuclei, and mutations, resulting from primary DNA damage, especially the DNA double strand break (DSB). Ideally, assays will detect DNA damage and cellular responses with high sensitivity, reliability, and throughput. Current assays involve in vivo cell-based analysis of surrogate markers for breaks, such as the gamma H2AX focus assay, or the tail moment of DNA from the Comet assay. The main regulatory assay for the detection of DNA damage caused by clastogens and aneugens is the animal-based rodent in vivo micronucleus assay. Novel next generation DNA sequencing technologies now make it possible to revolutionise the way we test for factors affecting the stability of the genome, and this could also include the testing of chemicals and compounds generated by humans, and those found in the natural environment. Furthermore, novel genome editing technologies offer the possibility of novel therapeutic modalities, which also need to be safety-tested for their potential genotoxic effects due to the established problem of 'off-target' editing. In this regard, we recently developed a novel method to capture DSBs induced by CRISPR-Cas9 editing of the genome, with a view to measuring such off-target editing. Remarkably, we have determined that the method, which we call INDUCE-Seq, is exquisitely sensitive to detecting DSBs in the genome over a very broad dynamic range. Current assays for detecting genetic damage (eg gamma H2AX and Comet assays) are far less sensitive. DSBs can be caused by both endogenous processes, such as DNA replication and gene transcription, but also by induced events such as restriction enzyme digestion, or nuclease-dependent genome editing. We have shown that INDUCE-seq is capable of simultaneously detecting both rare endogenous breaks in the genome, as well as highly abundant targeted breaks over a vast dynamic range. In this application, we seek to train a student in the principles of 3Rs research with a view to training them to help build the future tools that will replace the current use of animals in genotoxicity testing of novel chemicals and compounds. This will enable the safe development of new materials in the future. We plan to further develop INDUCE-seq to test for the measurment of chemical induced DSBs, to provide additional genomic DNA damage data to add to the battery of genomic and proteomic analyses currently being developed in the drive to establish the necessary tools for next generation risk assessment (NGRA). The aim of such initiatives, which include the EPAs Toxcast programme and the related Tox21 consortium, is the successful introduction of NGRA, with a view to the eventual elimination of animal testing of chemicals.

The molecular basis for this ethnic difference in disease incidence is unknown. This project tests the hypothesis that SNPs affecting the expression of putative stress granule components SRP14-AS1 and TDP43 predispose to Ewing sarcoma (ES). ES is characterized by a highly recurrent chromosomal aberration, a EWS-ETS (predominantly EWS-FLI1) gene rearrangement. The resulting fusion gene encodes for an aberrant ETS transcription factor which drives sarcomagenesis. In a large genome-wide association study, three ES susceptibility loci were previously discovered in intergenic regions of chromosomes 1p36.22, 10q21 and 15q15. Our preliminary results indicate that two susceptibility loci on chromosomes 1 and 15 affect putative components of insoluble cytoplasmic foci which form during early cellular stress response, the stress granules. As part of the FWF-funded ERA-NET project “PROVABES”, we interrogated the functional relevance of the ES susceptibility region on 15q15. By epigenome mapping, EWS-FLI1 ChIP-seq, and reporter gene assays we found this locus to localize to an EWS-FLI1 bound enhancer. By CRISPR/Cas9 mediated bi-allelic deletion we were able to link this enhancer to expression of the long non-coding RNA SRP14-AS1, which is transcribed from the bidirectional SRP14 promoter. SRP14 encodes an RNA binding protein and component of the signal recognition particle and of stress granules. While SRP14-AS1 expression levels were low under adherent growth conditions, they markedly increased upon detachment stress and surface-independent tumor cell growth. Modulation of SRP14-AS1 expression by siRNA or bi-allelic enhancer deletion significantly reduced soft agar colony formation of ES cells without affecting growth under adherent culture conditions. Preliminary results suggest that SRP14-AS1 binds to SRP14 and that SRP14-AS1 depletion reduces stress granule formation similar to TDP43 depletion. TDP43 is encoded by the TARDBP gene in the expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) harboring the ES susceptibility locus on chromosome 1p36. This study will therefore interrogate the role of stress granules in EWS-FLI1 driven ES pathogenesis and the mechanisms by which variations in SRP14-AS1 and TDP43 expression affect ES susceptibility. In a comprehensive work program we will explore the eQTL properties of SNPs in the regulatory region driving SRP14-AS1, chromatin conformation changes and the mechanism of transcriptional SRP14-AS1 induction upon cellular stress, the SRP14-AS1 associated proteome and its relation to protein translation regulation and stress granule composition, and the role of a functional interaction between EWS-FLI1, SRP14-AS1 and TDP43 in ES tumorigenesis. Finally, we will explore SRP14-AS1 expression as a potential predictive marker for ES susceptibility, and test stress granule inhibitory compounds for their anti-tumor activity. This project will therefore provide unprecedented insights into a novel mechanism of lncRNA mediated tumor predisposition.	Austrian Science Fund FWF	Stand-Alone Project	364795.2	EUR

Previous studies have shown that long heterochromatic regions of the genome, so called lamina-associated domains (LADs) are tethered to the nuclear envelope, thereby contributing to stable repression of genes within LADs. However, several differentiation-specific genes that are located outside of constitutive LADs also move away from or towards the nuclear envelope upon their activation and repression, respectively, but the molecular players and mechanisms involved are ill defined. In this project we will generate a novel “gene track” myoblast cell system by tagging the endogenous MyoD and Pax7 genes with lacO repeats using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, which will allow us to monitor movement of these genes from and to the nuclear envelope during myoblast in vitro differentiation. Using this “gene track” system we will identify differentiation-specific gene tethers at the nuclear envelope by systematically knocking out (using CRISPR/Cas9) a total of 31 different nuclear envelope transmembrane proteins (NETs), which were previously shown to be involved in tethering chromatin to the nuclear envelope and/or were found to be expressed specifically in muscle. We will identify NETs, whose knockout affects translocation of MyoD and Pax7, in a semi-automated microscopic screen and will test, how these NETs and the NET-mediated “gene tethering” is regulated during differentiation. Mechanisms to be tested include potential changes in the expression, localization and modification of relevant NETs during differentiation and/or epigenetic profile changes in the moving genes. Epigenetic changes in the gene loci will be addressed by chromatin immunopreciptation (ChIP) using antibodies to various active and respressive histone marks. Moreover, we will target the respective epigenetic modifier enzymes to the gene loci using lacI-enzyme fusions to test whether particular modifications are sufficient to initiate gene movements. We will also investigate association of identified NETs with genes on a genome-wide level by ChIP-deep sequencing and test whether specific sequence elements in or around the translocated gene loci are involved in tethering. Finally we will address whether lamins in the nuclear interior together with their binding partner lamina-associated polypeptide (LAP)2alpha are involved in differentiation-dependent gene translocation. These nucleoplasmic lamin complexes have recently been shown to bind open chromatin between heterochromatic LADs (including MyoD and Pax7 loci) and to affect epigenetic pathways. We will use LAP2alpha knockout myoblasts to study its involvement in gene relocalization and employ lacI-LAP2alpha fusions in the gene track myoblast line to test for direct effects on gene relocalization. Overall this study will provide novel insight into the enigma of regulated nuclear envelope tethering of specific genes during differentiation and will test the potential involvement of nucleoplasmic lamin complexes.

They are particularly important in response to proteotoxic stress and are key to cancer cell survival. On this basis, HSP inhibition is an attractive therapeutic option in cancer. Targeting HSPs may also overcome the challenge of tumour heterogeneity as proteotoxic stress is a widespread non-oncogene addiction. Whilst therapeutic Hsp90 inhibitors are in advanced clinical trials, resistance may result from upregulation of another chaperone Hsp70 that has important pro-survival functions. However, the pharmacology of Hsp70 is less well developed and the roles of Hsp70 in dividing cells remain to be characterized.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We have discovered that depletion or chemical inhibition of Hsp70 causes defects in spindle assembly, chromosome congression and mitotic progression. Mechanistically, Hsp70 is required for K-fibre assembly through association with ch-TOG and TACC3, while targeting of Hsp70 to the mitotic spindle is dependent upon phosphorylation by Nek6. Importantly, we also show that Hsp70 is necessary for clustering of amplified centrosomes. <strong>We therefore</strong> <strong>hypothesise that Hsp70 has key roles in the mechanism of mitotic spindle assembly and that Hsp70 pathway inhibitors will selectively kill rapidly dividing cancer cells with amplified centrosomes.</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Here, we will test this hypothesis through addressing three specific questions: (i) what are the mechanisms through which Hsp70 promotes spindle organization and centrosome clustering; (ii) how is the mitotic function of Hsp70 regulated by Nek6 phosphorylation; and (iii) do Hsp70 pathway inhibitors selectively kill cancer cells with amplified centrosomes? This hypothesis-driven project is based on exciting preliminary data, will exploit cutting-edge technologies - including super-resolution microscopy, generation of synthetic recombinant proteins and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene-editing - and be undertaken by a team of outstanding scientists with proven expertise in mitotic regulation and development and use of HSP inhibitors.</p>	Worldwide Cancer Research	Project Grant	233135.0	GBP

CRISPR loci in the genome store a record of past viral infection and act as an immune system. Transcription of these loci yields CRISPR RNA (crRNA) that is used by large, multisubunit ribonucleoprotein complexes to detect and degrade invading genetic elements. These CRISPR associated (Cas) complexes are typically up to 400 kDa in size and their structures and mechanisms are not fully understood. We have been funded by BBSRC since 2009 to study the CRISPR system, one of the very few labs in the UK in this area. In the current application we focus on the CSM (Type IIIA) Cas complex, which is the least well-understood CRISPR pathway. We recently published a detailed description of the subunit organisation and structure of the complex (Zhang, Mol Cell 2013). We now wish to work towards a molecular understanding of the structure and catalytic mechanism of the complex. Specific aims are to gain an understanding of crRNA binding by the complex, to define the dsDNA binding and cleavage mechanisms and to glean a greater understanding of the structure of the complex and its constituent parts.The CSM system, though more complex than Cas9, could provide an alternative method for targeted gene disruption. Until the fundamental science proposed here is carried out, we cannot determine whether there are practical advantages such as lower off-target effects for CSM over Cas9. This application seeks to lay the fundamental scientific groundwork that will help determine the structure, mechanism and potential applications of the CSM system.

55	Professor Malcolm White	University of St Andrews	None	2015-10-01	2018-12-31	CRISPR Adaptation - the basis for prokaryotic adaptive immunity	CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats) is an adaptive, antiviral defence system found in prokaryotes. CRISPR loci in the genome store a record of past viral infection. Transcription of these loci yields CRISPR RNA (crRNA) that is loaded into large effector complexes and used to target and destroy invading mobile elements. One of these effector complexes, Cas9, has shown great utility in targeted genome engineering in many biological systems from bacteria and plants to human cells. The underlying basis for the whole CRISPR system is the ability to capture small pieces of invading viral DNA and incorporate them into the genome to provide a memory of past infections. This process, known as "Adaptation" or "Acquisition", requires the Cas1 and Cas2 proteins, but is not understood at a mechanistic level and is widely acknowledged as the most important aspect of the CRISPR system requiring further study. Adaptation can be broken down into two parts - the capture of foreign DNA and subsequent integration into the CRISPR locus. In this project the White (St Andrews) and Bolt (Nottingham) labs will combine their expertise in biochemistry and genetics to tackle the mechanistic basis for CRISPR Adaptation in two model systems: S. solfataricus and E. coli. Both labs have made key advances in this area, showing that Adaptation involves replication fork restart in vivo in E. coli (Nottingham) and that Cas1 is highly specific for the trans-esterification of stalled replication fork model substrates in vitro (St Andrews). The work proposed promises to unravel the mechanism of Adaptation using genetics, molecular biology and biochemical techniques. The mechanism of Adaptation is the last significant missing piece of the CRISPR puzzle.	Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council	None	None	None

Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) stem from genetic defects that affect signal transmission at the neuromuscular synapse. They provide a rare example of genetic muscle disorders that are treatable if the underlying molecular mechanisms are understood. At least 19 causative genes have been uncovered with mutations identified in proteins involved in signal transfer, synaptic stability, or glycosylation. There are four objectives to this proposal: i) to use next generation sequencing techniques to resolve the genetics behind our residual undefined CMS cases; ii) to find out the mechanisms through which glycosylation mutations impair neuromuscular transmission; iii) to study molecular mechanism to explain how treatment with beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2-ADR) agonists results in dramatic clinical improvement; iv) when over-expressed in muscle DOK7 generates correctly located but greatly enlarged neuromuscular junctions or 'super synapses'. We will test the potential of these 'super synapses' as a novel gene therapy. Within the laboratory there is expertise for the analysis of neuromuscular junction proteins. Next generation sequencing techniques will be used to screen for genes with new CMS-causing mutations. Molecular genetic (including CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing), biochemical and fluorescence microscopy techniques will be used to generate and study disease models in fibroblast or muscle cells. Effects of beta2-ADR agonists will be studied in transgenic models, in myotube cultures, and within AChR clusters. Detailed analysis of molecular dynamics within AChR clusters will use super-resolution microscopy in combination with temporal and spatial optogenetic stimulation. Therapy, including adeno-associated virus delivery of DOK7 to generate 'super synapses', will be given to transgenic mouse disease models and analysed in vivo by strength tests and electromyography and ex vivo by electrophysiology, microscopy, and biochemical analysis.

We will use confocal fluorescence microscopy, live cell microscopy, super-resolution microscopy, immunoEM and CLEM (correlative light and electron microscopy) of cultured cells to test our hypotheses that: the site of active cathepsin acid hydrolase activity is the endolysosome and not the classical dense core lysosome; endolysosomes but not lysosomes have an acidic aqueous lumen; endolysosomes act as 'hot spots' for kissing and fusion with late endosomes and lysosomes; dense core lysosomes can be reformed from endolysosomes; that endolysosomes play a role in sensing nutrient availability and activating a lysosome-to-nucleus signaling pathway. We shall examine the role of specific SNAREs, SNARE combinations and tether proteins in fusions between late endocytic organelles using siRNA knock down and CRISPR/Cas (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRIPSR) associated (Cas) nuclease 9) knock out in cultured cells. We shall map the interactions of VARP with binding partners and study the role of VARP and its binding partners in traffic out of late endocytic organelles and in fusion between late endocytic organelles, testing our hypothesis that VARP plays a key role in regulating and coordinating traffic and fusion events in the late endocytic pathway.

58	Dr McCaughan	University of Cambridge	None	2015-10-01	2018-09-30	An organotypic model of bronchial dysplasia	We have developed a novel organotypic (OTC) model of bronchial dysplasia / early lung cancer. In this system, immortalised normal human bronchial epithelial cells are grown at the air-liquid interface on a collagen matrix with embedded fibroblasts. In OTC there is a clear phenotype in cells in which the activation of putative oncogenes at the air-liquid interface recapitulates a histological phenotype consistent with human bronchial dysplasia / early lung cancer. In vivo, multiple potentially important genotypes may co-exist and influence the cellular phenotypes. We have introduced complexity into our model by combining two genetic lesions, which leads to a more marked phenotype. For this studentship we propose two main scientific objectives. 1) To perform a medium throughput functional/phenotypic screen of an extended library of small molecule inhibitors in an in vitro model of bronchial dysplasia The student will first recapitulate the current OTC experiments and optimise them for a 96- transwell format (rather than current 12 well format) more suitable for screening therapeutic compounds. A 384-compound commercially available library that targets multiple key signal transduction pathways and comprises all classes of known anticancer compounds will be used. The impact of these compounds on the dysplastic phenotype will be interrogated. 2) To extend the existing in vitro OTC model to cover more complex genotypes and assess the impact of these changes on hits from Aim 1) Using existing lentiviral protocols and the recently introduced CRISPR technology further/other genetic lesions will be introduced into the same immortalised cells with the aim of producing the more complex genotypes. Further, the microenvironment will be manipulated. The impact of these refinements on the development of dysplasia and the effect of anticancer compounds will be interrogated.

59	Dr McCaughan	University of Cambridge	None	2018-11-01	2020-10-31	A novel murine model of squamous lung cancer	Squamous lung cancer (SQC) has been significantly more challenging to model than adenocarcinoma and progress in understanding its pathobiology and developing targeted therapeutics has been slow. To address this unmet need we have developed a novel orthotopic model of SQC. We have refined/optimised a protocol for the expansion of primary murine tracheobronchial epithelial cells (mTBECs). We have optimised the genetic manipulation of primary mTBECs via multilocus CRISPR and lentiviral transduction so that clinically relevant genotypes can be rapidly recreated in primary mTBECs. Further, we use inducible constructs so that genes of interest can be turned on and off at will throughout the natural history of the disease. The manipulated mTBECs are injected into the right lung of a syngeneic animal. Recipient mice therefore have an intact immune system and develop localised disease with the potential to metastasise. We have demonstrated in pilot data that this approach generates early murine SQC lesions within 3 weeks and large invasive tumours at around 4 months in wild type immunocompetent animals. This model can revolutionise the field - and lead to a dramatic reduction in the number of mice required to perform experiments; as well as refinements that reduce the ASPA Severity limit to Moderate and remove the need for toxin administration. Our scientific aims are to characterise the natural history of SQC in this novel syngeneic murine orthotopic model, to validate the model as being both reproducible and directly relevant to the human disease. Further, we will use luciferase-based imaging to ensure longitudinal studies on individual animals are feasible. Second we will apply the model to efficiently address key basic and translational issues: the necessity of a driving oncogene for SQC maintenance; the potential to use AKT inhibition for SQC chemoprevention; and a demonstration that it will have utility for studying the tumour immune microenvironment.

60	Dr Simon Bullock	MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology	None	2004-01-01	2100-12-31	Molecular cell biology of cytoskeletal transport	Cytoplasmic transport of organelles and macromolecules by molecular motors is of fundamental importance for the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity. In addition, defective motor transport is implicated in neurological diseases and pathogenic viruses and bacteria frequently exploit cellular transport routes. The challenge of studying microtubule-based transport is that movements are driven by large macromolecular assemblies, with a single cargo often bound simultaneously by multiple opposite polarity dynein and kinesin motors. Using a tractable model system in Drosophila embryos we have shed light on mechanisms responsible for polarised sorting of specific mRNA molecules by microtubule motors. We have revealed molecular links between localising mRNAs and dynein and used novel in vitro motility assays to show that long distance movement of the motor is activated by mRNA localisation signals. Recently, together with Andrew Carter’s lab at the LMB, we have used purified mammalian proteins to show that the adaptor protein BicD is a key factor in switching on dynein processivity. We have also elucidated the mechanisms of dynein regulation by Lissencephaly-1 and mRNA localisation signals. We have also been investigating how cargo transport is orchestrated in neurons using the intact Drosophila nervous system as a model. We recently established a novel imaging assay in the adult wing and are using it to study the relationship between axonal transport and the healthy lifespan of neurons. We have developed and distributed optimised tools for CRISPR genome engineering in Drosophila, and are using these in several of our own projects. Our long-term plans are to combine genetics, cell biology, structural studies and single molecule assays to understand the key processes that control sorting of cargos and pathogens by motors. This should have therapeutic relevance; for example, it may be possible to target drugs to discrete regions of the cell to maximise their efficacy or to develop agents that stimulate motor activity in order to alleviate problems associated with defective transport in neurodegenerative diseases.

61	Dr Ingo Greger	MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology	None	2003-10-01	2100-12-31	AMPA receptor biogenesis and allosteric control	AMPA receptors (AMPARs), glutamate-gated cation channels, are main mediators of excitatory neurotransmission and are central to synaptic plasticity, a process underlying learning. AMPARs are also essential for brain development and their dysfunction contributes to various neurological diseases, rendering them a potential drug target. AMPARs are composed of four pore-forming (core) subunits and various types of auxilliay subunits, in various combinations. The composition of the AMPAR comlex is essential for post-synaptic signal processing as it determines: signalling properties, trafficking to/from synapses and synaptic positioning of the receptor. Our research aims to unravel mechanisms underlying AMPAR biogenesis, receptor organisation, and principles of allosteric regulation. We built on this information to investigate rules of receptor operation at synapses in the brain to ultimately understand its central role in information storage and learning. The bulk (~80%) of the receptor’s mass is extracellular (facing the synaptic cleft) and is composed of two domains - the ligand-binding domain (LBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD), which are connected by a flexible linker. We showed that the sequence-diverse NTD is essential for receptor assembly and for anchoring at postsynaptic sites and that deletion of the NTD impedes synaptic potentiation. We hypothesise that the NTD provides a (subunit-selective) synaptic anchor that positions the receptor opposite presynaptic glutamate release sites and that this process is essential for efficient signal transmission and synaptic potentiation. Inherent to this model is the unique conformational freedom of the modular AMPAR extracellular region, permitting NTD interactions with (to be identified) synaptic cleft proteins. We have observed conformational dynamics in coarse-grained simulations, by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo EM), and by peptide mapping (where we detect interactions between the membrane-distal NTD with the membrane proximal TARP). We aim to characterise structural dynamics of AMPAR/auxiliary subunit combinations predominating at hippocampal CA1 synapses (a well characterised, plastic model synapse) by single particle cryo-EM and are aiming to isolate NTD interactors in biochemical screens. Results from these efforts will be studied in an intact CA1 neuronal circuitry, where we utilize our in vitro data to selectively manipulate both receptor conformations and expression profiles of NTD-interacting proteins using CRISPR. We are also implementing 3D-stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (3D-STORM) in brain tissue, which will allow us to follow AMPAR dynamics (and NTD-mediated positioning) at synapses undergoing potentiation with high precision.

Chronic inflammation has been shown, both experimentally and epidemiologically, to be a predisposition to, and also an inseparable aspect of clinically prevalent cancer entities. Therefore, a detailed understanding of both tumour and immune cell functions in cancer progression is a prerequisite for more successful therapeutic startegies. My team was the first to reveal the lymphocyte-intrinsic PKC/NR2F6 axis as an essential signalling node at the crossroads between inflammation and cancer. It is the mission of this project to identify molecular signatures that influence the risk of developing tumours employing established research tools and state-of-the-art genetic, biochemical, proteomic and transcriptomic as well as large scale CRISPR/Cas9 perturbation screening-based functional genomic technologies. Defining this as yet poorly elucidated effector pathway with its profoundly relevant role would enable development of preventive and immune-therapeutic strategies against NSCLC lung cancer and potentially also against other entities. Our three-pronged approach to achieve this goal is to: (i) delineate biological and clinical properties of the immunological PKC/NR2F6 network, (ii) validate NR2F6 as an immune-oncology combination target needed to overcome limitations to "first generation anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors" rendering T cells capable of rejecting tumours and their metastases at distal organs and (iii) exploit human combinatorial T cell therapy concepts for prevention of immune-related adverse events as well as of tumour recurrence by reducing opportunities for the tumour to develop resistance in the clinic. Insight into the functions of NR2F6 pathway and involved mechanisms is a prerequisite for understanding how the microenvironment at the tumour site either supports tumour growth and spread or prevents tumour initiation and progression, the latter by host-protective cancer immunity.

63	Univ.Prof. Dr. Meinrad Josef Busslinger	Research Institute of Molecular Pathology GmbH - Vienna	None	2018-01-01	2022-12-31	Transcriptional control of plasma cell development and function	Antibody-secreting cells consisting of short-lived proliferating plasmablasts and long-lived quiescent plasma cells are essential for the acute response to infection and long-term protection of the host against pathogens. Only a few regulators (Blimp1, IRF4, XBP1, Aiolos, Ikaros and E-proteins) have been implicated in the transcriptional control of antibody-secreting cells, and their target genes, with the exception of Blimp1 and E-proteins, are still unknown. This proposal aims to systematically identify key players in the development and function of antibody-secreting cells by using the CRISPR/Cas9 and Cre/loxP methods. For this, we improved existing protocols to extend the duration of in vitro plasmablast differentiation and showed that Rosa26(Cas9/+) B cells infected with Blimp1 or Xbp1 sgRNA-expressing retroviruses recapitulated the Blimp1 and Xbp1 mutant phenotypes in this proof-of-principle experiment. Moreover, Cre retrovirus-mediated deletion of Irf4, Ikaros and Aiolos strongly impaired plasmablast differentiation in this optimized system. To discover new regulators of plasma cell differentiation, CRISPR/Cas9-based screens will be performed with pooled sgRNA libraries targeting all known upregulated genes in plasmablasts and plasma cells, followed by individual validation of the best hits. Selected top-ranked genes will be analyzed in vivo by conditional mutagenesis with newly generated, plasma cell-specific Cre lines. Regulated target genes of IRF4, Ikaros, Aiolos, XBP1 and the XBP1-regulated transcription factor Bhlha15 will be identified in plasmablasts by ChIP- and RNA-seq analyses. Target genes with potentially interesting functions will be further characterized by CRISPR/Cas9- or Cre/loxP-mediated mutagenesis. These experiments will provide fundamentally new insight into the molecular mechanisms controlling the development and function of antibody-secreting cells, which are the essential effector cells of humoral immunity.

The study will offer important insights into the function of SLCs, most of which are poorly characterized, and is expected to shed light into the intertwining of metabolism and signaling and, potentially, open up possibilities to stop viruses by starving them of key building blocks. Both research areas, viral-host interactions and solute carrier proteins, are increasingly becoming the object of significant research efforts from the scientific community. At the same time, it would be inappropriate to consider them mainstream yet. Research on solute carrier proteins has traditionally been focused on individual proteins and individual transport phenomena and it is only through relatively recent efforts of pioneering individuals and initiatives that over-arching themes and connections are becoming apparent. We aim to characterize the role of host SLCs in the viral life cycle as well as confirm their function as a new regulatory group of proteins in the antiviral immune response. Upon integration of the multiple large-scale datasets from recent genome-wide screens, a group of 20 SLC proteins has been identified to have a function linked to viral replication or immune response. We will systematically inactivate the genes encoding these SLCs using CRISPR/Cas9 technology in the haploid human cell line HAP1 and screen for the effect of these mutations on the susceptibility of the cells to virus infection. Moreover, we will study the protein-protein interactions of the most interesting candidates and will try to deduce, through metabolomics and bioinformatics approaches, the natural cargo that may be critical during the viral life-cycle. Together, this “viral transportome” will offer new insights into possible strategies to pharmacologically interfere with viral infections. We are seeking support for one postdoctoral fellow and a 50% time commitment from a technical assistant in order to complete this proposal. They will complement the efforts currently made by PhD student Anna Moskovskich, who generated the SLC KO lines and is already involved in setting up the primary and secondary screens with several viruses. We will work closely with Keiryn Bennett, the group leader of the CeMM Proteomics facility and a world-renowned mass spectometrist, who will help and assist with the proteomics and metabolomics aims of the project. Moreover, this proposal will also benefit from collaborations with Douglas Kell (University of Manchester, UK) and Matthias Hediger (University of Bern, CH) and from the virology expertise of Gijs Versteeg (MFPL, AT) and Franz Heinz (MUW, AT).

The structural studies in York (IR-A,IR-B,IGF-1R) are re-focused due to gains achieved in the current MRC grant. Receptors and their constructs will be expressed only in the baculovirus system (yielding currently more reproducible/better crystals). Complexes with insulin/IGF1/2 will be expanded for highly specific analogues to decipher their structural signatures. Hormone receptor affinities will be evaluated by ITC & Novo Nordisk proprietary assays. TK protein expression/structural work will be carried in Cork, while TK crystal studies will be done with York. Frequent BAG beam access to DLS (Didcot), and remote data collection are well established. The exploitation of the larger constructs (i.e. IR ectodomains) by cryoEM is initiated, and it will be continued. However, when suitable grids:constructs are established, the cryoEM work will form a separate grant application. Hormones. Analogues of insulin, IGF1/2 will be semi-/fully-synthesised or expressed in E.coli; IOCB has key expertise here. The established wide range of analogue assays (receptor affinities and autophosphorylation, cell viability etc.), will be expanded for IGF-2R receptor essays; unique radio-active (125I, Eu) IGF2 tracers will be produced. All analogues with novel properties will be used in structural studies with the receptors, and optimised further in novel human muscle/fat-tissue cell-based platforms developed here. Cells. CRISPR-Cas9 will be used to knockout all IR isoforms individually (and IGF-1R), creating a novel insulin unresponsive cell line. This line will be transfected to express specific receptor(s) profile, then the insulin/analogues responsiveness of these cell lines will be characterised with respect to i) glucose transport, ii) the proportion of HA-GLUT4-GFP expressed/present at the cell surface, iii) IR downstream effectors activation.

The expression of DEXI, a gene with no paralogue in the human genome, is correlated with risk of T1D at the 16p13.13 region. Increased DEXI expression in monocytes is associated with protection from T1D, however DEXI's specific function remains unknown. Our in vitro work with DEXI manipulation in monocytic cell lines suggests that DEXI encodes a protein which impacts on cytokine responses to external stimuli. We have also generated the first DEXI monoclonal antibody so are now uniquely poised to investigate the function of DEXI effectively at a whole organism level. DEXI is highly conserved between humans and mice. We will test the hypothesis that reduction of Dexi expression using cutting-edge CRISPR technology in a spontaneous diabetes mouse model, the Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) mouse, will increase the incidence and accelerate the development of diabetes. Evaluation of the immune system of such mice will also provide insight into the function of the Dexi protein and potentially reveal novel T1D pathways and targets for intervention.

Methodology: Gene knockdown has already been achieved using CRISPR-Cas9 technology in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) model. Immunological and phenotypic studies will include evaluation of cytokine production and activation status in response to a range of stimuli and single cell RNA-Seq of selected cell types. Microbiome analysis will be undertaken on DNA extracted from faeces in the NOD and in spontaneously diabetic pet dogs undergoing veterinary treatment. Microbiome transfer experiments will also be undertaken in the NOD model in the presence and absence of Dexi. Scientific and medical opportunities: Discovery of novel pathways in autoimmune disease susceptibility offers new opportunities for therapeutic or preventative intervention.

The genetic cause is expansion of CTG repeats in the 3&rsquo;-UTR of the DMPK gene, which leads to RNA toxicity, nuclear foci and altered gene splicing. Increasing repeat number (50-2000) correlates with disease severity but inversely correlates with age of onset. While cell and animal-based models have helped understand molecular pathophysiology of DM1, non-physiological expression levels of DMPK transgenes and species differences mean relevance to the human condition has been questioned. Few data exist on pathophysiology of functioning human heart cells. Using our experience in hiPSC, we will investigate pathophysiology of DM1 in human cardiomyocytes to improve risk stratification and evaluation of emerging treatments. Stability of repeats will be determined during reprogramming of somatic cell types from DM1 patients and differentiation of hiPSCs to cardiomyocytes. Isogenic controls will be produced by CRISPR targeted correction of DM1 hiPSC lines. These resources will allow the molecular, structural and functional impact of DM1 to be investigated in hiPSCcardiomyocytes. This will provide new ways to stratify patient risk and evaluate emerging experimental treatments for DM1, including antisense oligonucleotides and small molecules (e.g. protein inhibitors, antibiotics &amp; kinase inhibitors, with the latter identified by the Brook lab).&lt;/P&gt;	British Heart Foundation	Project Grant	299933.0	GBP

We will now measure replication of defined HCV/DV/ZV subgenomic replicon systems encoding luciferase and full length viruses in Cyp manipulated cells (RNAi/CRISPR or CypI) to identify the Cyps involved and the active CypI, and to define the role of innate immunity in the inhibitory process (by manipulating sensors and adapters to rescue inhibited infection). We will explain CypI antiviral specificity by correlating Cyp specificity (measured in recombinant protein binding assays) with antiviral specificity. We will examine the effect of Cyps on the viral replication compartments (confocal/electron microscopy), testing whether sensors colocalise with viral RNA/proteins on Cyp manipulation, and how host and viral proteins are relocalised when sensing is activated. We will discover which viral proteins are targeted by Cyps using binding assays between candidate proteins as well as by immunoprecipitating viral proteins and examining copurifying cellular proteins using mass spectrometry. We will determine how Cyp recruitment changes viral proteins using X-ray crystallography of Cyp-viral protein complexes. We will select virus CypI resistant mutants and characterise their sensitivity to innate immunity. We will identify the sensors and innate immune pathways activated by wild type and mutant viruses in Cyp manipulated cells. Overall, this work will define the Cyps acting as cofactors for Flaviviridae, explain how they aid in evasion of innate immune sensing, and produce a series of specific and potent inhibitors that disturb innate evasion to unleash the innate immune system against the virus as a new paradigm for antiviral prophylaxis and therapy.

For years, these conditions were considered sporadic and the underlying cause(s) were poorly understood. This makes treatment extremely challenging, and cure impossible particularly since the therapies used have significant side effects, and are “untargeted”. Excitingly, in 2014 an inherited form of polyarteritis nodosa was discovered called deficiency of adenosine-deaminase-type-2 (DADA2), caused by loss of function mutations in the CECR1 gene. Following this discovery, we identified several cases (n=25) at GOSH with this disease. We have established that treatment with biologic agents targeting TNF-alpha is particularly effective, but has side effects, is expensive and is required to be given by injection for life. Moreover, NHS England often refuse to provide funding for this treatment leaving patients with little hope of treatment. We now have a very realistic opportunity to cure DADA2 within a relatively short period of time using gene therapy. By resolving the root cause of this form of vasculitis, gene therapy now offers a real prospect of cure, never before possible in this field. Aims: The aim of this project is to establish the feasibility of correcting in vitro the gene defect associated with DADA2 using established gene therapy techniques. Experimental plan: This research will be contacted in the following phases: 1. We have developed a CECR1 knockout monocyte cell line (THP-1) derived using CRISPR/CAS9 and will now examine that the knockout has comparable immunophenotype to monocytes from DADA2 patients (reduced ADA2 expression; M1/M2 skewing and pro-inflammatory cytokine production). 2. In the second phase we will develop a specific self-inactivating (SIN) lentivirus vector encoding CECR1 cDNA. 3. We will then evaluate the efficacy of gene transfer using this vector by examining: (i) restoration of ADA2 enzyme activity (ii) immunophenotyping of macrophages derived from transduced CD34+HSC or THP-1 monocytes for amelioration of M1/M2 skewing; (iii) the interactions with cultured endothelial cells under various pH and hypoxia conditions; and (iv) confirm that the transduced stem cells maintain their colony forming capacity. Relevance to Arthritis Research UK and potential patient benefit: This study represents the first realistic steps towards a true cure for a severe form of genetic vasculitis. The results of this study will then inform the development of an international programme of work for gene therapy to cure DADA2 in humans. We strongly believe that a cure is now possible for this disease, which would significantly improve quality-of-life, and ultimately would result in significant health economic cost savings over a patient’s lifetime. This innovative project will also lay the foundations for curing other monogenic inflammatory diseases, an important mission for ARUK.	Versus Arthritis	Invited Research Award	132556.82	GBP

Background:Estrogen Receptor (ER) is the driving transcription factor in ~75% of all breast cancers. It is also the target of endocrine therapies, but drug resistance is a common clinical problem. The progesterone receptor (PR) and androgen receptor (AR) pathways are active in ER+ cells, but the putative cross-talk that exists with ER is unclear. ER is dependent on pioneer factors such as FoxA1 and GATA3 for activity and both of these factors were recently shown to be mutated in breast cancer. Aims:We will characterise the functional interplay between ER, progesterone receptor (PR) and androgen receptor (AR), with the goal of characterising how PR and AR influence ER activity and whether there is potential competition or co-operation between PR and AR pathways in modulating ER activity. We will identify post-translational modifications on FoxA1 and GATA3 and identify upstream regulatory enzymes that influence the activity of these two important factors, with the goal of identifying druggable targets (i.e. regulatory kinases) that could be exploited for targeting of FoxA1 or GATA3. As a parallel aim, we will engineer in the recently observed mutations that occur in ER, GATA3 and FoxA1, to assess the impact on ER function and the cross-talk that exists between ER, PR and AR. A novel method will be developed in order to characterise PR and AR isoforms that might be involved in ER regulation.Methods:We will assess the impact of activation of PR and/or AR pathways on ER activity by assessing transcription factor-DNA interactions (ChIP-seq), gene expression events (RNA-seq) and growth differences. This will be explored in a physiologically relevant explant system. Mutant GATA3 and FoxA1 expressing cell lines will be generated using CRISPR-Cas9 or ZFN technologies and characterised. Upstream regulators of GATA3 and FoxA1 will be discovered using CRISPR or siRNA screens. A novel chromatin pull-down approach will be developed, based on modifications of the ChIP-exonuclease mapping method.The results will define the variables that influence treatment responses from existing antiestrogen therapies. In addition, it will provide the rationale for using existing hormonal agents for the treatment of endocrine resistant cancer, in novel combinations. Furthermore, it will identify new therapeutic targets and provide the biological justification for the use of new treatment strategies in endocrine resistant patients.

Whilst significant progress has been made in understanding the unique cell biology of Leishmania and its interaction with the mammalian host, little is known about the signalling pathways that regulate key events in the parasites’ life cycle and which protein kinases are essential and therefore potentially amenable to chemotherapeutic modulation. To address this we will carry out gain-of-function and loss-of-function genetic screens in Leishmania mexicana to identify protein kinases involved in signalling pathways regulating parasite differentiation during transition between animal and sandfly hosts. We will also identify those protein kinases essential for proliferation and survival of Leishmania once an infection is established in the two hosts. This will be possible because of recent development in genetic manipulation of Leishmania, including CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering, tetracycline inducible over-expression and the use of rapamycin induced diCre recombinase to study the function of essential genes. The expected output of the project will be novel insights into protein kinase function in Leishmania and a holistic overview of cell signalling pathways that will integrate into ongoing “omics” analyses within the Leishmania community.

Defects in mitochondrial turnover are closely linked to Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. A hereditary form of PD is caused by mutations in the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin; this protein has been shown to mediate selective autophagy of damaged mitochondria, called mitophagy. Several lines of evidence and data from published large-scale whole genome studies suggest a functional link between Parkin and myosin VI and its cargo adaptors. To test this hypothesis and analyse the link between myosin VI and Parkin in more detail we will use in situ proximity labeling and a combination of confocal fluorescence microscopy, live cell and super-resolution microscopy as well as electron microscopy. To determine the requirement of myosin VI and its adaptor proteins for Parkin-mediated mitophagy, we will use siRNA KD cells, KO cells created by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, primary fibroblasts and neurons from our myosin VI KO mouse as well as iPS cells generated from human PD patient fibroblasts. In addition we will employ multiple approaches to assess whether loss of myosin VI or its adaptor proteins affects mitophagy and thereby leads to an accumulation of damaged mitochondria with reduced function.

Vertebrate size is established based on total cell number generated during development. Despite the 75 million-fold difference in size between the smallest and largest mammals, the mechanisms for this remain to be determined. This proposal seeks insight into how total cell number is determined in both pathological and physiological states. Over the last decade our study of extreme growth disorders has identified 18 new human disease genes. We established these encode core components of the cell-cycle machinery, providing cellular and developmental insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of these disorders. From our starting point of human disease, this approach also revealed novel genome instability genes informing fundamental research of basic biological processes. Still, the molecular basis for over half of individuals with microcephalic dwarfism remains unknown. This proposal will break new ground through the comprehensive application of Whole Genome Sequencing to our patient cohort to achieve screen saturation via identification of coding and non-coding mutations. Forward-genetic genome-wide CRISPR screens in developmentally relevant cell and organoid systems will also be developed to define key cellular processes impacting human growth. Beyond these ‘discovery science’ approaches, cellular and model organism techniques will be used to define the mechanistic basis for human disease caused by mutations in core replication machinery and key epigenetic factors. To extend prior work on pathophysiological mechanisms, we aim to establish a subset of microcephalic dwarfism genes as growth regulators, and thereby further define when and how organism size is determined. These studies will link essential cellular machinery governing proliferation with human disease, identify novel genome-stability factors and may yield insights into the developmental regulation of mammalian size.

75	Professor Geoffrey Smith	University of Cambridge	Pathology	2017-12-01	2020-11-30	Using viruses to study kinesin-1 recruitment, regulation and function	The microtubule network and associated kinesin-1 motor mediate the transport of cargo to specific places within cells and this is critical for normal cell function. Defects in kinesin-1 function or regulation can lead to disease, such as Parkinson's, Huntington's and Alzheimer's. How kinesin-1 binds to and moves along microtubules is well known, but how it binds specific cargos and how its activity and target destination are regulated are less well known. Several viruses exploit kinesin-1 to transport newly formed virus particles out of the cell. An example is vaccinia virus (VACV), the vaccine used to eradicate smallpox. Our lab uses the recruitment of kinesin-1 by VACV as a model to study the mechanisms that control the binding of cargo to kinesin-1 and activation of the motor. This is the subject of this application. The kinesin-1 complex contains 2 kinesin heavy chains (KHC) and 2 kinesin light chains (KLC). Its activity is regulated by autoinhibition. Activation involves binding by cargo proteins that induce a structural change in the complex enabling association with microtubules. Mammalian cells express multiple kinesin-1 types (isoforms), each with slightly different biochemical properties that may bind different cargos or move to different destinations. This project will study the mechanisms by which VACV recruits and activates kinesin-1 to transport virus particles out of infected cells, to determine the structure of the virus proteins involved, and to investigate the expression and functions of the different KLC isoforms and splice variants for cell biology and which ones are hijacked by the virus. The information gained will help understanding of the recruitment and regulation of kinesin-1 activity is in normal cells and how dysregulation can lead to disease. Another objective of the project is to study the properties and functions of different kinesin light chain (KLC) isoforms and splice variants to understand their roles in cell biology.

They may be derived from the B-Cell or T-cell lineage and are generally mature in nature. The prognosis of lymphomas greatly varies and is dependent on the stage and histology of the disease. Although up to 60% of young patients (<60y) with aggressive Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) are cured by combination immune-chemotherapy, older patients have a fairly dismal outlook. However, low-grade indolent disease such as Follicular lymphoma (FL are commonly incurable. Worryingly, the incidence of malignant lymphomas continues to rise, and at 3-4% increase per year appears far in excess of what would be expected simply from the ageing of the population. The identification of critical mediators of lymphomagenesis and novel therapies that target them is therefore a priority for this increasingly common malignancy and unmet medical need. To address these questions, we will use unique mouse models that we have developed engineering in the ability to generate and record further progression events through insertional mutagenesis, specifically within B-cells. This system will allow us to robustly answer the question of the contribution of the initial cell-type to outcome and phenotype of lymphoma. Using the presence of a unique premalignant phase within the model, we will also characterize alterations of transcription, epigenetic state and signaling that occur during lymphoma evolution, through a combination of single cell and bulk RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq and ATATC-Seq, promoter based capture HiC and intracellular flow cytometry. Finally we will test a priori hypotheses about the requirement for specific DNA repair pathways and residual CREBBP/P300 function in these Crebbp-/- lymphomas, as well as performing a genomewide CRISPR/Cas9 dropout screen to identify further genotype-specific vulnerabilities, a subset of which will be further tested in our in vivo model.

Increasing lines of evidence implicates impairments of MSN specification and maturation during development as major contributors to HD. Also, reduced CTIP2 transcription factor level and together with its dysfunction in the striatum are thought to contribute to HD pathogenesis. However, due to our limited knowledge of human striatal development and a lack of defined aetiology and causal mechanisms of pathogenesis, there is currently no effective treatment for this disorder. We have previously developed a reliable method for inducing MSNs from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and also generated CTIP2 mutant ESC lines using CRISPR technology. We found that CTIP2KO MSNs exhibited HD-like cellular pathologies compared to MSNs derived from isogenic control hESCs. Moreover, genome-wide RNAseq analysis of CTIP2KO MSNs revealed a significant overlap between CTIP2 regulated genes and those altered in HD iPSC-derived neurons and mouse models of HD, providing direct evidence that CTIP2-deficicy leads to MSN pathogenesis. Therefore, we will in this proposal determine how CTIP2 hypofunction leads to neuronal death and MSN dysfunction, and the extent of which contribute to HD pathogenesis, using a combination of CTIP2KO hESCs, HD iPSCs and animal models of HD. This work will determine gene regulatory networks and signalling pathways in striatal neurons governed by CTIP2 and provide insight into mechanisms behind cellular abnormalities in HD MSNs. The knowledge obtained from these studies will facilitate the development of new and more effective treatments for HD.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	708067.0	GBP

79	Dr John McLauchlan	University of Glasgow	None	2013-05-01	2021-03-31	Viral Hepatitis	HCV will remain a serious healthcare burden for the foreseeable future and despite attempts at intervention, new infections will persist, particularly in the 'people who inject drugs' (PWID) group. Emergence of antiviral resistance that could be transmitted in the community, and the impact of the inherent diversity within and between HCV genotypes on patient treatment are crucial challenges. In addition, virus evolution occurs in a genetically diverse host background, ultimately shaping response to infection. Fundamental questions on the contribution of host factors to pathogenesis and their role in determining the outcome of DAA therapy need to be addressed for those who fail to clear virus. Our core objective is to tackle viral evolution and host response as interconnected issues. We have developed initiatives and expertise which are central to our plans. To translate our research findings for clinical benefit, we will capitalize on HCV Research UK as a unique resource for clinical data and samples and utilize next generation sequencing (NGS) and bioinformatics pipelines to determine the evolution of viral resistance in those who do not respond to therapy. In addition, creation of gene knockouts by CRISPR technology combined with single cell sequencing will be pivotal for understanding the contribution of host factors as drivers of viral diversity, including DAA-resistance. Our future programme thus encompasses clinical to fundamental research, populations to single cells, incorporating in vivo, in vitro and in silico dimensions. In the same vein, we set out a strategic plan for the rational design of a HCV vaccine from our studies on neutralising antibodies. Virus eradication will not succeed through antiviral therapy alone due to lack of availability and cost, and resistance may be problematic. Our aim is to isolate unique antibodies from niche patient cohorts from HCV Research UK that are otherwise difficult to access. Again, our objectives are rooted in extensive expertise allied to the benefits of core-funded sequencing platforms and cognate bioinformatics expertise. Moreover, the collaborative network established with a range of disciplines will energise the plans and bring unique ideas to confront the obstacles preventing vaccine development.

Angiotensin II (AngII) activation-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage are primary events in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and failure. In our pilot study, we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate 2 novel mouse models with total and cardiac deletion of prolylcarboxypeptidase (PRCP), an AngII-degrading enzyme. We observed that the loss of PRCP worsened AngII-induced cardiac hypertrophy and oxidative stress in mitochondria. In this study, we aim to 1) investigate the function and signalling route whereby PRCP acts as a negative regulator of cardiac hypertrophy/heart failure through degrading AngII, 2) whether PRCP is a suitable target for the management of heart failure, focusing on its role in ameliorating oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage. To achieve the aims, we will use cutting- edge technologies including CRISPR/Cas9 technique, adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)- mediated gene delivery, recombinant peptide transduction and human induced pluripotent stem cells derived-cardiomyocytes (iPS-CMs). Molecular and translational evidence obtained from this study will provide new insights in developing efficient therapies for heart failure by means of enhancing PRCP action or the synergetic use of PRCP and other AngII blockers.

(Ms Tayyiba Azam)	Myocardial infarction (MI) by ischemic insult causes cardiomyocyte death and tissue destruction that lead to heart failure. Mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 7 (MKK7) is an important stress-activated kinase. We have previously shown that MKK7 is protective against pathological hypertrophy, which, like MI, results in cell death and heart failure. In the preliminary study, we observed that MKK7 cardiac-deleted (MKK7-CKO) mice were vulnerable to 1 week MI insult. In this PhD project, we will provide theoretical and technical training to the student to gain thorough understand of whether MKK7 is an important cardiac protector against MI through 3 objectives: 1) Assess MKK7 cardioprotective effects against MI in MKK7 cardiac overexpression (MKK7-Tg) mice. 2) Mechanistic study in adult rat cardiomyocytes (ARCMs) will be performed to investigate protective machinery through which MKK7 operates. 3) Human relevance of MKK7 function will be assessed using CRISPR/Cas9 mediated MKK7 knockout human embryonic stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (MKK7-KO-hESC-CMs), which have been generated in our lab. This project will advance our understanding of heart protective system during MI, and provide clues on whether MKK7 could be used therapeutically to reduce MI-induced injuries and adverse remodelling, therefore preventing heart failure development.

Recent studies have identified formation of DNA/RNA quadruplexes, dipeptide repeat proteins (DPR) and altered nucleocytoplasmic transport as potential triggers of GGGGCC (G4C2) related neuronal cell death. The effector pathways leading to neurodegeneration in ALS/FTD remain to be discovered however. The project aims to determine these neurodegenerative effector pathways by combining the power of pure human motor neuron cultures and non-dividing yeast, and in collaboration to validate these in zebrafish models. The specific aims are: 1. To identify potential effectors of G4C2-triggered neurodegeneration by comparative transcriptomic analysis of pure FACS-isolated motor neurons from induced pluripotent stem cells from patients with C9orf72 expansions, gene-corrected lines (using Cas9/CRISPR) and age-matched controls. 2. To classify the intermediates of G4C2-triggered neurodegeneration as aggravating, counteractive or homeostatic, by using gene overexpression/knock down in cultured motor neurons. 3. To establish their genetic hierarchy and molecular interactions in non-dividing S. pombe yeast. 4. To test the effectors as targets for pharmacological therapy in a zebrafish model of G4C2-linked ALS/FTD. In order to achieve these ambitious aims, we have gathered three leading European teams with documented expertise in the field of stem cell biology, ALS pathology and systems biology in this highly innovative and translational project.

This modification is removed by a single enzyme, OGlcNAc hydrolase (OGA). Both proteins are essential for mammalian embryonic and perinatal survival, respectively. Recently, mutations in OGT have been identified as causal in intellectual disability (ID), however, the exact mechanism leading to this disorder are unknown. This studentship will endeavour to identify how two hypothesised mechanisms contribute to OGT-ID: altered O-GlcNAcylation and altered OGT:protein interactions. To achieve this the student will use Drosophila melanogaster as a model system. OGT is highly conserved from humans to Drosophila, along with many of its interactors, such as the mitochondrial motility protein Milton and periodicity proteins involved in the circadian rhythm. The student will dissect the molecular mechanisms leading to ID through achieving 4 aims. (1) The student will generate fly lines carrying OGT mutations equivalent to those found in patients using a CRISPR/Cas9 system. We have already demonstrated the viability of this approach successfully generating a fly line carrying a patient mutation. (2) These fly lines will then be assayed for a number of neuronal phenotypes, both morphological and behavioural. The former will be achieved using a combination of genetic and antibody labelling to visualize gross brain morphology, mushroom body morphology (the associative memory region of the fly brain, and an excellent model to study axonal morphology), and dendritic morphology using class IV dendritic arborisation sensory neurons. To assay neuronal function through behaviour, a light-off habituation test will be employed. This leverages the natural escape response of Drosophila to a sudden reduction in light, in nature signalling the presence of a predator, and measures their neuronal adaptation to the repetition of this stimulus without the ordinarily associated consequence. In preliminary experiments, we have found a decrease in habituation in OGT mutant flies. (3) The specific mechanisms driving the observed phenotypes will be dissected through proteomic and transcriptomic approaches. Quantitative O-GlcNAc proteomics will be conducted through enrichment of O-GlcNAcylated proteins with a catalytically inactive OGA we have used for this purpose in the past. The role of individual proteins or modified sites will be probed through genetic approaches, ablating induvial proteins to assess genetic interactions or individual modified sites by mutating modified residues to alanine. An additional approach which can be employed is the mutation of identified sites to cysteine. We have found this results in a SGlcNAc modification which is not hydrolysable by OGA, elevating the stoichiometry of the modification on a single residue. This is a technique which has never before been employed in vivo, and we would assay in the context of rescuing (some of) the phenotypes seen in OGT mutant flies. (4) The student will also attempt to rescue observed phenotypes by globally manipulating O-GlcNAc levels, genetically by knocking out OGA (which unlike in mammals is tolerated in the fly) and pharmacologically through the use of OGA inhibitors or glucosamine supplementation. All aforementioned approaches have been shown to result in elevated OGlcNAcylation. Their efficacy at rescuing phenotypes will be assayed through administration at various developmental stages providing insight into the reversibility of the ID in adult organisms. Together, this studentship will answer many fundamental questions about the role of OGT mutations in the development of ID, establish Drosophila as a model for the functional analysis of single site O-GlcNAc modifications, and guide future research we will conduct on a mammalian system.

Research Objectives 1: Understand DUX4-Pax7-HIF1alpha axis. Express a panel of DUX4 or PAX7 constructs via viral-mediated delivery (including constitutively-active and dominant-negative versions) in FSHD/control myoblasts to assay effects on HIF1alpha and its downstream target genes (RT-qPCR, Western and immunostaining). 2: Determine if Pax7 interferes with HIF1alpha levels. Investigate whether constitutive Pax7 expression will suppress HIF1alpha activity in FSHD myoblasts. Conversely, inhibit Pax7-target genes using dominant-negative PAX7 or DUX4 constructs to examine effects on HIF1alpha activity. 3: Determine if elevated HIF1alpha contributes to apoptosis in FSHD. Inhibit HIF1alpha with specific inhibitors, and siRNA and/or CRISPR Cas9 in FSHD myoblasts to determine if cell survival is improved. Examine interactions between HIF1alpha and P53. 4: Inhibit/overexpress/stabilise Hif1alpha in myoblasts and examine if canonical Wnt signalling is altered using TopFLASH/FopFLASH luciferase activity assays. Determine whether increased canonical Wnt signalling/beta-catenin activity affects HIF1alpha and rescues myogenesis/survival under oxidative stress. 6: Determine if antioxidants including vitamin C, vitamin E, CoQ10 reduce HIF1 activity while improving myogenic differentiation in FSHD myoblasts. Is vitamin C as effective when HIF1alpha activity is inhibited/enhanced/stabilised? 7: Perform RNASeq on healthy and FSHD myoblasts exposed to antioxidants to further decipher the signalling pathways that are altered to improve myogenic differentiation/survival under oxidative stress. This research will both further reveal disease mechanisms and also allow better understanding of potential therapies for FSHD.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	371400.0	GBP

Nevertheless, only a handful of genes have been demonstrated to be detrimental or essential for reprogramming. It has also not been shown which genes are directly targeted by the Yamanaka factors at different stages of reprogramming. Thus, this project aims to illuminate molecular mechanisms of reprogramming by 1) performing CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome-wide knockout screening and 2) dissecting changes of direct targets of the Yamanaka factors during reprogramming with inducible mouse DamID-seq technology. One of the difficulties to investigate the molecular mechanisms of reprogramming is the low efficiency and heterogeneous cell populations during the process. To circumvent these problems, we have identified cell surface markers that allow us to isolate more homogenous reprogramming intermediate subpopulations than simple time course analyses. In addition, we have established a system where robust and homogenous expression of the Yamanaka factors can be induced in mouse embryonic fibroblasts with constitutive expression of Cas9 by administration of doxycycline. We will apply lentiviral gRNA library containing 90,000 gRNAs targeting all protein coding genes in the mouse genome to identify genes detrimental or essential for efficient reprogramming. For the second objective, we have been optimizing DamID-seq technology, which has often been used in Drosophila, in mouse cells. DamID-seq is a complementary technology to ChIP-seq, with an advantage of being able to perform with smaller starting cell numbers due to the absence of the antibody-mediated pulling down step. Through this project we aim to improve the human iPSC derivation technology and identify molecular mechanisms that can be applicable for the swift and efficient generation of various cell types important for medical applications.

86	Dr Steven Pollard	University of Edinburgh	None	2014-08-01	2015-07-31	Equipment supplement: The role of SOX and FOX genes in orchestrating transcriptional and epigenetic programs in glioblastoma	Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most devastating human cancers. There are few treatment options and median survival is only around one year. Sequence-specific transcription factors required for normal neural stem cell self-renewal are likely to play critical roles in driving unconstrained self-renewal in GBM. Particularly interesting are members of the forkhead box (FOX) and SRY-related (SOX) families, which orchestrate lineage choice, differentiation and proliferation/survival pathways in the developing nervous system. For example, there is clear evidence that FOXG1 and SOX2 cooperate to establish and sustain the neural stem cell state. Although each of these factors has been previously implicated in human GBM, we have poor mechanistic understanding of their specific functions and key downstream effectors. Aims: We will define the specific function, molecular partners and transcriptional targets of FOXG1 and SOX2 in normal human neural stem (NS) cells and GBM-derived neural stem (GNS) cells. Our hypothesis is that in GBM the increased level and/or activity of these factors restricts differentiation, locking cells into a continuous cycle of self-renewal. There are three complementary aims: 1) Test the role of SOX and FOX in establishing and sustaining GBM. 2) Determine the molecular basis of SOX2 and FOXG1 activity by defining their molecular partners and key transcriptional targets. 3) Exploit our expertise in genome editing to explore FOX and SOX gene function and create live cell reporters for drug screening. Methods: We will use primary human GBM-derived cell lines as a tractable and disease-relevant model. We have routine access to fresh tumours and a set of well-characterized GNS cell lines. Intracranial transplantation will be used to assess the malignancy of cells following perturbation of FOXG1 and SOX2. Tumour initiation will be tested by delivery of lentiviral overexpression vectors into the mouse forebrain. ChIP-seq, and immunoprecipitation mass spectometry (IP-MS) will be used to determine targets and partners, respectively. Genome editing methods (TALENs and/or CRISPR/Cas system) will be exploited to generate conditional alleles and knock-in reporters. How the results will be used: SOX2 and FOXG1 proteins are important therapeutic targets, yet we need to define their precise molecular activities to identify ‘druggable’ effectors. These might be direct protein partners within the transcriptional/chromatin regulatory complex, or downstream transcriptional targets. The SOX2 and FOXG1 reporter cell lines developed in this project will be of immense value for cell based screening for new drug discovery.	Cancer Research UK	TCDB - Personal Award	None	None

This will give insights into the processes that enable these organisms to enter a quiescent state that protects them from both immunological and chemotherapeutic intervention, and also provide novel targets against which to develop new drugs. Specifically, we aim to characterise the range and extent of post-translational modifications to proteins (specifically histones) involved in chromatin formation in Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania infantum and L. mexicana cells undergoing passage through the life cycle and in response to metabolic pertubations. This will involve the isolation of chromatin from different parasite lifecycle stages, and isolation of the individual proteins of the complex (using immunopreciptation methodologies with antibodies specific for the trypanosomatid histones, and BioID approaches to identify neighbouring members of the complex). Proteomic approaches will determine the repertoire of proteins involved. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) on individual proteins will be assessed using specific antibodies and also mass spectrometry of digested proteins to seek mass changes consistent with different PTMs. The abundance of individual metabolites in cells at different cell/lifecycle stages will be determined using LC-MS based untargeted metabolomics. CRISPR/cas9 approaches will allow rapid knockout of non-essential enzymes producing metabolites implicated in PTM, and use of different metabolic substrates will also be used to modulate their abundance to asses impact on epigenetic change and gene transcription by RNAseq.

The obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii requires iron however little is known about iron in this parasite. My goals in this project are to determine mechanisms for sensing, acquisition and usage of iron by the parasite. Using a combination of biochemical and genetic techniques I will determine the source of parasite iron and how it modulates the iron acquisition in the host. To investigate if the parasite can respond to iron, I performed RNAseq on parasites grown under high iron or with iron removed and determined genes transcriptionally regulated by iron, including several genes with predicted roles in iron transport and metabolism. Although several iron-related genes have been predicted in Toxoplasma, none have been studied and it is likely that other, more divergent, genes exist. To find novel genes required for survival under low and high iron conditions, I will perform genome-wide pooled CRISPR screens. Genes with changing phenotype scores across different iron conditions will be characterised through genetic and biochemical assays to understand their function in parasite pathogenesis. This project seeks to use novel chemical and genetic strategies to understand and characterise the interactions between iron and Toxoplasma gondii.

89	Professor Mark Field	University of Dundee	School of Life Sciences	2015-01-01	2015-12-31	Newton001: Targeting the surface proteome of Trypanosoma cruzi	The surface of all cells represents the site for interaction with the environment, but for protozoan parasites the surface also has a fundamental role in interactions with the host. For T. cruzi, specific interactions with host cells to mediate cell invasion, are an essential component of the T. cruzi life cycle. Mediating this process are a number of cell surface molecules that participate in a plethora of interactions; the flexibility of this process likely accounts both for the ability of T. cruzi to invade a wide range of cell lineages/tissues as well as many mammalian species. Significantly, the cell surfaces of trypanosomes are highly distinct, with few proteins conserved and the major known antigens being involved in host cell invasion (mucins/trans-sialidases). We propose the following experiments, to be performed in T. cruzi, that will combine technology development together with the discreet analysis of the impact of the Usp33/Rbx1 ligase on the surface protein composition of T. cruzi and the evaluation as a potential drug target. 1. We will develop a CRISPR/Cas9 system for the conditional knockout of the Usp33 and Rbx1 genes in T. cruzi. 2. We will analyse the impact of Usp33 and Rbx1 knockout on the surface proteome of T. cruzi using SILAC methodology. 3. Both Usp33 and Rbx1 will be tagged with GFP (endogenous) for purposes of localisation, as well as providing an affinity handle for the isolation of complexes, and in particular to ascertain if Usp33 and the Rbx1/Cullen/Elongin interact directly (where there is evidence they do in mammalian cells) and potentially also to identify substrate proteins. 4. We will study the impact of the genomic modifications of the differentiation of T. cruzi from the insect to infective stage (metacyclic trypomastigotes), the capacity to attach, invade and proliferate in mammalians cells.

The metastatic spread of cancer cells throughout the body is absolutely dependent on the ability of cancer cells to change their shape – such as during tissue invasion, intravasation, and extravasation. Many of the cell shape changes that drive metastasis can be promoted by signals in the tumour microenvironment, including the stiffness of the tissue, and inflammation. Rho GTP Exchange Factors (RhoGEFs) are conserved regulators of cell shape that are activated by microenvironmental factors and play critical role in metastasis. In a series of previously performed genetic screens we have identified 14 RhoGEFs that we hypothesise promote the cell shape changes that underpin breast cancer metastasis in response to tissue stiffness and/or inflammation. The identification of these RhoGEFs opens up new avenues for the development of anti-metastatic therapeutics, but their role in regulating cell shape must be further characterised before they can be considered bona fide targets for manipulation in cancer cells. In particular, it is important to understand: if these RhoGEFs regulate cell shape in 3D environments with similar stiffness and geometry as tumour cells would encounter in vivo; which are the key downstream effectors of these RhoGEFs that mediate the effects of RhoGEF activation; how these RhoGEFs act to regulate downstream signalling dynamics to control cell shape; whether inhibition of these RhoGEFs affects metastasis in vivo. Aims and Methods: 1) Determine whether the 14 RhoGEFs we have identified in previous screens regulate cell shape and migration/invasion by using quantitative analysis of single cell shape following depletion of each RhoGEF in cells cultured in 3D collagen matrices of differing stiffness. 2) Identify the signalling effectors for all 14 RhoGEFs using novel computational analysis of in-house and publicly available datasets. 3) For selected RhoGEFs determine how these RhoGEFs regulate downstream signalling dynamics in single cells using novel quantitative reporters. 4) Validate whether the activity of selected RhoGEFs contributes to metastasis in vivo using CRISPR mediated knockdown in mouse models. We will also determine how RhoGEFs regulate downstream signalling activity in vivo. How the results of this research will be used: This work will describe the biochemical pathways that activated by RhoGEFs to regulate the morphogenesis, and thus provide the basis for the development of anti-metastatic therapies.

This consortium brings together experts in molecular and cell biology (including human induced pluripotent cells, iPS), imaging and electrophysiology, and train 3 Postdocs in biology of addiction and translation. We will be addressing five major addictions, which all depend on the brain cholinergic system. The project is based on human genetic studies that identified polymorphisms of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors predisposing to smoking. In addition, four other addictions have been linked to this locus: cocaine, alcohol, opioid and cannabis. Thus, nAChRs belong to the most promising pharmacological targets influencing addictive behavior. The main objectives of NICO-SNP are the development and characterization of animal models carrying nAChR polymorphisms; the development and characterization of human induced pluripotent cells carrying polymorphisms and the identification of molecules which can be used to treat the addiction. In Vienna we will analyze functional properties and downstream effects of nAChRs in human dopaminergic (DA) iPS cells. Particular emphasis will be laid on two types of receptors: alpha5-containing hetero-pentamers, and alpha7 homo-pentamers. With the support of the French collaboration partner DA iPS cells will be genetically manipulated using CRISPR technology in order to either express the polymorphisms alpha5-398D, alpha5-398N or no alpha5 at all. Another line of DA iPS cells will be engineered to express human alpha7, plus/minus the partial duplicated alpha7 gene, which is found in humans only (CHRFAM7A) or no alpha7. Our preferred method of analysis will be Ca++ imaging, based on the Fura-2 technique. When indicated, Ca++ imaging will be combined with patch clamp electrophysiology in order to determine fractional Ca-currents. The prime agonists for creating dose-response curves will be nicotine and ACh (in the presence of atropine), and the specificity of effects will be established by adding antagonists like DHbE, MEC or a-conotoxin MII. Where indicated, activation of alpha7 receptors will be prevented by including 5 nM MLA in the drug application system. Experiments will show the impact of alpha5D or its N variant on intracellular Ca++ transients. Prolonged exposure with low concentrations of nicotine will reveal whether the genotypes differ significantly in their desensitization properties, whether receptor upregulation is maintained in the alpha5N variant, and whether nAChR activation affects DA production and the function of GABAA receptors. Experiments will further show the functional impact of CHRFAM7A, if any.	Austrian Science Fund FWF	None	299672.1	EUR

Prof.Dr. Peter VALENT	Ludwig Boltzmann Gesellschaft	None	2018-02-01	2022-01-31	Impact of Age-Related Clonal Hematopoiesis on Evolution of Atherosclerosis in CML	Recent data suggest that hematopoietic ageing is associated with an accumulation of somatic mutations and that acquisition of such mutations is associated with an increased risk a) to develop a myeloid neoplasm and b) to develop life-threatening cardiovascular events. Correspondingly, the incidence of cardiovascular events increases with age and is higher in patients suffering from certain myeloid neoplasms. However, little is known about cellular interactions and molecular mechanisms contributing to cardiovascular events in these patients. One hypothesis is that clonal myeloid cells directly mediate inflammation and vascular damage and thus contribute to atherosclerosis in elderly patients. Another hypothesis is that vascular cells are in part derived from clonal pluripotent leukemic stem cells and that the acquired mutations alter endothelial cell function which in turn facilitates the occurrence of atherosclerosis. We and others have recently shown that patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treated with nilotinib or ponatinib have an increased risk to develop atherosclerosis and severe cardiovascular events. In addition, we found that nilotinib and ponatinib can directly induce alterations in the phenotype and growth properties of vascular endothelial cells. More recently, we have detected age-related somatic loss-of-function (LOF) mutations (TET2, DNMT3A, ASXL1) in patients with CML treated with nilotinib. These mutations were detected at the time of a major or complete molecular response and were found to cluster in those patients in whom a cardiovascular event was recorded during therapy. In the current project, the functional impact of age-related LOF-mutations and their distribution among hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells in CML will be investigated. In a first step, clonality of various leukocyte-subsets and microdissected endothelial cells will be determined at diagnosis and at the time of a major molecular response. Next, the effects of age-related LOF-mutations on macrophage- and endothelial cell function will be examined. The pro-atherogenic effects of LOF-mutations will be analyzed by measuring expression of pro-atherogenic receptors and mediators in endothelial cells and macrophages after CRISPR Cas9 or shRNA-mediated knock-down of TET2, DNMT3A, or ASXL1. In addition, the impact of LOF-mutations will be studied in Ldlr-/- mice crossed with LOF gene-deficient mice. In order to define early stages of pluripotent stem cells and their angiogenic potential in CML, we will generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from primary CML cells, and will explore the effects of various targeted drugs, including nilotinib, ponatinib, and lenalidomid, on differentiation of iPSC into endothelial cells and macrophages. The long term aims are to 1) identify target-pathways triggering differentiation of CML stem cells into endothelial cells and macrophages, to 2) define the pro-atherogenic and anti-angiogenic impact of LOF-mutations under drug-exposure, and to 3) identify drugs capable of interfering with stem cell differentiation into endothelial cells and macrophages and with the pro-atherogenic activity of LOF-mutations. The results of our study should contribute to a better understanding of pathogenetic factors and mechanisms underlying vascular changes in CML patients and pave the way for therapeutic strategies through which pro-atherogenic and thromboembolic events can be prevented in these patients.

This equipment will support the research of approximately 30 academic research groups within the School of Life Sciences including 21 Wellcome Trust funded Principal Investigators. The research by these groups includes cell and molecular biology, bacteriology, immunology, mammalian developmental biology, parasitology and drug discovery. A dominant focus is on cell signaling, particularly in the context of the immune system, the regulation of cell metabolism and neuro-degeneration. There are also projects involving bacteria, yeast, trypanosomes and leishmania, as well as multiple non immune mammalian cells. The requirement for a new FACS stems from increased usage in research projects, a large increase in demand for use of single cell sorting cell sorting as part of efficient and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing protocols. There is also the need to use Biological Safety Containment level 2 for cell sorting to allow translation of research ideas generated using model organisms to studies of freshly isolated human blood derived lymphocytes and other human cells.

My 2018 publications in European Heart Journal and Circulation Research showed HCM could be phenocopied by a set of 11 isogenic CRISPR/Cas9 variants of the MYH7 gene (beta myosin heavy chain) of human pluripotent stem cell-cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs). Twelve different phenotyping methods were used to interrogate the generated human cell lines, often showing contradictory results relative to animal models. Importantly, a cohort of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) potentially linked to HCM was identified by RNA sequencing. This collection of cell resources, underpinning technologies and putative lncRNA pathway controllers form the basis of this proposal. Hypothesis and plans: I hypothesise that unveiling the function of these novel lncRNAs will provide new mechanisms and drug targets for HCM. To test this hypothesis, I propose to modulate the expression of these lncRNAs in hPSC-CMs by harnessing the dead Cas9 technology. I will then assess the phenotype of up/down-regulating these lncRNAs in the context of HCM, by employing the methodologies previously developed (molecular and functional assays). This will enable determining the role of lncRNAs in HCM - either as disease-causing or cardioprotective per se, or as gene modifiers regulating the primary disease effects caused by the structural defect. Finally, prediction and validation of lncRNA-interacting proteins by coupling in silico tools with molecular biology methods will result in the identification of new pathways involved in HCM, shedding light into the development of future drug treatments. If replacement of 50% of animals for HCM research could be achieved by further validating the human model, this will equate to sparing of 2100-5000 animals (of all species) in severe procedures in the next 10 years.

Summary: The cardiac sarcomere is a multi-protein complex essential to cardiac contractile function. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) are caused by pathogenic variants (PV) in sarcomere protein genes. Variants in genes directly involved in cellular contractility MYH7 (&beta;-myosin heavy chain), MYH6 (&alpha;-myosin heavy chain), and MYBPC3 (Myosin binding protein C) are either known or hypothesised to cause disease. Previous analyses of the mechanisms by which variants cause disease have relied on rodent models and extrapolation from clinical data. The introduction of clinically defined mutations into human iPSC-CMs using CRISPR/Cas-9 would allow the interrogation of these cellular phenotypes in a human background using molecular and mechanical strategies, adding clarity to the uncertainties of variant-phenotype relationships in these genes. Key goals: i) Interrogation of the molecular and biophysical (contraction and relaxation) mechanisms by which PVs in MYH7, MYH6, and MYBPC3 cause either HCM or DCM. ii) Define the contractile mechanism of MYH6 and MYH7 PVs to establish if they mirror one another. iii) Investigate if high throughput functional analyses of iPSC-CMs can be used to test individual variants of unknown clinical significance (VUS) to discriminate between those that are disease causing versus ‘benign’.

Data will be analysed using FastQc software, the 10x genomics Cell Ranger software suit, and R for further processing. 'Seurat' R package will be used to normalise expression values. Clustering will be performed prior to dimensionality reduction using PCA and data clustered in the reduced dimension space using "Seurat" package prior to visualisation using tSNE plots and assessments of batch distributions for each dataset visualised to ensure clustering not driven by batch effects. Cluster markers will be recorded together ontology enrichment analysis for each cluster. Cell differentiation trajectories will be reconstructed using R Package "monocle". To identify putative lineage regulators we will identify factors that change between phenotypic branches using branched expression analysis modeling. We will validate our findings by confirming anatomical segregation of novel populations of cells with differing functions or in differing disease states. Here we will use immunohistochemistry (IHC), single-molecule in situ hybridisation (sm-ISH) and immunofluorescence. The relationship of individual colonic mesenchymal niche cells with specific epithelial cells will be examined using novel multiparameter imaging technologies such as Codex, imaging mass cytometry (IMC) or multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI). We will develop methods to isolate/sort newly identified progenitor cells and test how these differentiate into stromal cell states we know to exist in health and disease in the adult colon. We will use CRISPR/Cas9 gene targeting to remove key transcriptional determinants associated with cell differentiation stages to establish their role in shaping mesenchymal architecture in health and disease.

This approach harnesses sperm chromatin decondensation during fertilisation; decondensation depletes the paternal genome of almost all nucleoprotein, making it an extremely good substrate for recombination. Previous methods to engineer whole animals inject the Cas9 machinery into embryos that have long-since completed fertilisation, skipping this recombinogenic decondensation step. We have shown that sperm injection harnesses decondensation to enhance recombination in random transgenesis and homology-independent Cas9-mediated editing. We now seek to optimise DNA integration by HDR in a sperm injection protocol that we have already demonstrated in preliminary experiments. We will demonstrate targeted DNA integration following sperm injection with CRISPR, Cas9 cRNA and proven targeting constructs. These target Oct4, Rex1 or Cdx2 genes, resulting in characteristic fluorescence patterns in preimplantation embryos after culture in vitro for 3.5 days. Gene targeting in embryos with promising expression patterns will be confirmed by RT-PCR and genomic PCR, which we routinely apply to preimplantation embryos. This in vitro system allows us to optimise the protocol without having to produce offspring, cutting costs, time and animal numbers. The method promises to streamline mouse and large animal genome-engineered biomedical modeling. We will demonstrate targeting in mouse offspring by transferring embryos after micromanipulation to recipient surrogate mothers. Offspring will be characterized phenotypically, to confirm that the method does not introduce unexpected phenotypes, and genetically by PCR and Southern blotting to reveal the percentage of offspring harbouring alleles with the anticipated targeted configuration.

However, PD GWA loci often contain more than one gene. Furthermore, for most currently proposed PD GWA genes within the associated PD risk loci, the mechanisms linking them to PD are only tentative. The aim of this proposal is to undertake a biological validation of plausible PD GWA risk genes in zebrafish (Danio rerio), using a CRISPR/Cas-based, in vivo pathway analysis approach. Zebrafish offer unprecedented opportunities to rapidly study crucial aspects of PD GWA genes in a well characterised vertebrate model system. Zebrafish share greater sequence homology and are more likely to have functionally conserved mechanisms than other small model organisms. They also provide excellent opportunities to study the effect of GWA genes on a wide range of relevant mechanisms, including the 1. Dopaminergic neuronal activity in vivo, neurotransmitter homeostasis and loss of dopaminergic neurons; 2. Interaction between neuronal and non-neuronal cell death mechanisms (in particular neuroinflammation); 3. Interaction between PD GWA genes and ageing. We will combine neurophysiological, neurochemical, morphological and functional analyses with comparative RNA-seq based transcriptomic studies. Using the CRISPR/Cas strategy, we have already made stable mutant zebrafish lines for the PD GWA risk genes mccc1, gak, inpp5f, vps13c, gch1, sipa1l2, srebf1, acmsd, stx1b and tmem175 as well as additional stable mutant lines for the familial PD genes PINK1, LRRK2, Parkin and ATP13A2. The immediate availability of these lines will greatly accelerate the progress of this proposal. We will particularly focus on three pathobiological mechanisms, namely mitochondrial function/mitophagy, the autophagy/lysosome system and neuroinflammation. We will also undertake an in vivo gene-gene interaction screen to investigate PD GWA genes for their functional interaction with familial PD genes.

Association studies have been successful in determining over 100 genetic regions containing variants associated with RA risk. However, since the vast majority of these variants lie in non-coding regions of the genome, there has been limited success in finding disease-causing genes. The challenge now is to attach causal genes, variants, pathways and cell types to these association signals. Recent advances in molecular biology techniques, including genome editing and nuclear dynamic technologies have enabled the design of functional experiments to address these questions. We have developed an extensive molecular biology pipeline, involving chromosome conformation capture based technology (CHi-C), chromatin immunoprecipitation and genome editing technologies, that has already provided important insights into an RA associated region. Here we propose to extend our pipeline, to follow up interactions found in our CHi-C study between non-coding RA risk loci (CDK6, COG6/FOXO1, 16p13 and ARID5B/RTKN2) and their potential targets by, firstly, confirming causal genes using targeted chromosome conformation capture (3C) and gene expression. Secondly, prioritizing strongly correlated SNPs for functional studies using bioinformatics, and, finally, exploring their transcriptional regulatory activity using genotype-specific 3C and chromatin immunoprecipitation, coupled with genome editing technology such as CRISPR/Cas9.

It enables students to directly engage in frontier research. Participating faculty has acquired a total of 43 ERC grants in the life sciences, and VBC PhD students have co-authored milestone publications like the discovery of tracrRNA, the Cas9/CRISPR mechanism or the establishment of cerebral organoids from human pluripotent stem cells. Founded in 1993, the programme has produced a strong track record of graduates that have accepted leading positions in science, science management or private research. Moreover, the VBC PhD programme developed a thorough training and education programme that builds on the PhD curriculum for life sciences of the University of Vienna, from which students obtain their degree. Research into Stem cells and Development is one of the core research areas on the Vienna BioCenter, connecting basic research groups across the different research institutes and faculties participating in the VBC PhD programme. The proposed research in this proposal will strengthen two central research directions of this consortium: (i) The first research direction focuses on cellular programmes and aims to define the molecular mechanisms that drive stem cells to into lineage-specific programmes, or – conversely – permit differentiated cells to de-differentiate. This also includes the question how the homeostasis between stem cells and differentiated cells is regulated on the tissue level. (ii) The second research direction investigates how stem cells form whole tissues, and how this process can be recapitulated and molecularly dissected ex vivo, building on the recent breakthroughs in organoid culture and genome editing. The proposed PhD projects of the consortium match these central research directions, and take full advantage of the excellent research environment available to the students. This covers state-of-the-art facilities, including the newly founded Stem cell core facility (ISCCF) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences that will be a central player for stem cell expertise and training to the consortium. Likewise, the consortium will benefit from the association of a strong bioinformatics group providing and developing methodology for large data analyses. This will meet foreseeable challenges posed by the advent of massive parallel cellular transcriptomics and other high-throughput technologies. Finally, the students will profit from the world-class science performed in interfacing research areas, such as (i) RNA biology, gene regulation and epigenetics (ii) molecular medicine or (iii) neuroscience; and from the list of outstanding scientists that visit the campus as part of the VBC lecture series. Together, this will provide the students funded by this proposal with an excellent training and research environment in which they can mature as scientists, follow their curiosity, and contribute to original research discoveries that will break new grounds in distinct areas of stem cell research.

Progress in deciphering its molecular pathogenesis has accelerated dramatically in recent years, propelled in significant part by advances in cancer genomics. Despite such progress, the treatment of AML patients has remained largely unchanged for decades, with cytarabine, first described in 1961, representing the last major addition. This reveals a significant unmet medical need and to this end we have recently developed a powerful and flexible CRISPR-Cas9-based platform for the performance of genome-wide recessive screens to identify genetic vulnerabilities in leukaemia cells. We have gone on to adapt this platform to the study of AML cell lines and primary AMLs from genetically-engineered mice. Our results so far have i) identified circa 500 genes that are essential to AML cells and have the potential to serve as therapeutic targets and ii) given novel insights into AML pathogenesis. From this work, it is evident that the unbiased nature of these screens makes their findings orthogonal and highly complementary to hypothesis-driven mechanistic studies that we and others have been conducting. Aims In the proposed work, I plan to build on our findings so far to identify gene targets of differentiation therapy, search for mutation-specific genetic vulnerabilities in AML, study AML drug resistance/sensitisation and investigate the pathogenesis of selected AML subtypes. Methods We will combine CRISPR-Cas9 screens with our bespoke mouse models and other reagents developed in my lab to: i) identify potential targets for AML differentiation therapy, ii) define genotype-specific vulnerabilities of selected AML subclasses, iii) derive mechanistic insights into the function of AML driver genes such as NPM1 and DNMT3A and iv) identify ways to enhance the effectiveness of existing therapies by overcoming drug resistance and also by finding genetic pathways whose co-inhibition can synergistically enhance AML cell killing. How the results of this research will be used I anticipate that this work will generate important insights into the pathogenesis of AML and also identify novel therapeutic approaches and candidate target genes, the most promising of which will be taken forward for the development of new treatments against AML and related malignancies. Given our experience so far, I expect that we will identify several novel potential therapeutic targets some of which we will pursue ourselves and others which will be pursued by others in the AML scientific community.

Checkpoint blockade immunotherapies successfully unleash the potential of pre-existing T cell responses against tumor antigens. However, the subversion of the immunogenic function of classical dendritic cells (cDC1s and cDC2s) by the tumor micro-environment constrain the development of such immuneT cell responses. Therefore, antigen delivery using adoptive transfer of cDCs is a promising immunotherapeutic approach. CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) have been shown to generate cDC1s (Clec9a+XCR1+). Current culture protocols, however, fail to generate bona fide cDC2s (CD14-BDCA1+). In addition, the rarity of circulating CD34+ HSPCs, might limit their implementation in immunotherapy. Human induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) can be differentiated in CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors and represent a potentially inexhaustible source of immunologically compatible cells for cellular immunotherapies. The over-arching goal of this project is to generate improved methods for the generation of both cDC1s and cDC2s subsets amenable to a cDC vaccine approach in cancer patients. Specifically, we aim: a) To develop a method to efficiently generate cDC1 and cDC2s, from CD34+ HSPCs or from iPSCs. To this end we have developed a unique approach based on co-culture of progenitors with engineered mesenchymal stromal cell lines (eMSCs) delivering defined combinations of hematopoietic growth factors. b) To perform genetic modification of iPSCs to improve cDCs immunogenicity. To this end, we will use CRISPR-Cas9 for loss-of function of regulatory “immune checkpoints” like PD-L1 in iPSCs. c) To develop pre-clinical model for the evaluation of T cell activation by cDCs in vivo. We will use immune-deficient NOD-SCID-gc mice transgenic for human MHC I (NSG.A2) reconstituted with polyclonal or oligo-clonal autologous T cell repertoires (using T cells transduced for a TCR anti-MART1/HLA-A2). Using this system, we will evaluate the ability of autologous cDC2s, cDC1s, or a mixture of both to induce anti-tumoral CD8+ T cell responses against the MART1 melanoma antigen.

103	Dr Richard Mort	University of Lancaster	None	2020-01-07	2023-01-06	A next generation Quiescence and Cell Cycle Indicator (QuCCi) for the refinement and reduction of animal usage in proliferation assays	Healthy tissues develop normally and are maintained through a tightly regulated cell cycle (or proliferation program). Lengthening or shortening of the cell cycle is a fundamental disease mechanism in development, ageing and cancer. It is likely that many developmental diseases are caused at least in large part by early defects of cell proliferation and many studies are now using mouse models of these conditions to explore this hypothesis in numerous systems. Mouse cell cycle kinetics are often investigated using thymidine analogues such as BrdU - incorporated into DNA during S-phase. These techniques rely on multiple injections or the surgical implantation of mini osmotic pumps to deliver the analogue. Recently, genetically encoded cell cycle probes have been developed and these are key to refining proliferation assays because they can be combined with live-imaging efficiently generating large datasets from fewer animals. Of these, the best existing model is the R26Fucci2aR (developed by RLM) reporter model because of the 1:1 stoichiometry of probe expression and the ability to control expression spatio-temporally with Cre-recombinase. However a number of shortcomings still exist: 1) It does not discriminate S-phase from G2/M-phases; 2) It does not discriminate G1 from quiescent cells in G0. 3) The probes are technically difficult to detect with antibodies limiting them to live studies. In order to address these shortcomings we will develop a next generation Quiescence and Cell Cycle Indicator (QuCCI) and Rosa26 QuCCi knock-in reporter mouse. QuCCi incorporates the the tried and tested probes p27K-,hCdt1(Cy-) and hGem(1/110) fused to mCerulean, mCherry and mVenus respectively including unique epitope tags. QuCCi can discriminate between cells in G1, S, G2/M and G0. The PhD student will join an existing team across Lancaster University (UK), Edinburgh University (UK) and McGill University (Canada) who have already committed time and resources to the development of the model. The team that we have assembled to support the studentship is perfectly placed to facilitate the project because we have extensive experience and proven track records in developing multicistronic constructs and cell lines (Dr. Mort, Dr. Ford), generating transgenic mice using CRISPR/Cas9 technology including the insertion of large constructs using injection into two-cell embryos (Dr. Yamanaka, Dr. Cowan) and in performing image analysis and quantitative imaging techniques (Dr. Mort, Prof. O’Shea).

To address this problem, our project aims to: 1. To understand and compare how artemisinin sensitive and resistant parasites respond to known transmission-blocking drugs 2. To develop the methodology to quantitatively assess male and female gametocyte functional viability in malarial patients 3. To adapt our Pf DGFA methodology to a form amenable for large scale implementation for transmission-blocking clinical trials We will combine established gametocyte producing P. falciparum artemisinin-sensitive and -resistant isolates with our existing validated in vitro transmission-blocking assay (Pf Dual Gamete Formation Assay - Pf DGFA) to initially determine whether primaquine (PQ) or methylene blue (MB) (and their metabolites) show modulated transmission-blocking activity in a resistant background. As a standardised control, we will also generate a panel of lab strain parasites containing known mutations linked to artemisinin resistance by CRISPR. To extend this investigation we will also compare 34 known transmission-blocking molecules in the Pf DGFA in both sensitive and resistant backgrounds. Taking our in vitro data on PQ and MB transmission-blocking efficacy, we will repeat our investigation using ex vivo parasites taken from malarial patients under PQ/MB treatment. Finally, we will adapt the Pf DGFA into a form amenable for evaluation of transmission-blocking field trials. Our project aims to deliver evidence-based recommendations about the use of PQ and MB for controlling the spread of artemisinin resistant parasites; a screening platform to evaluate current and future antimalarials for efficacy against artemisinin resistant parasites; and a robust tool to accurately measure transmission-blocking during field trials.

Despite their prevalence, the concrete functional roles of these alterations are not well understood, for two reasons: First, cancer samples tend to carry many correlated epigenetic alterations, making it difficult to statistically distinguish relevant driver events from those that co-occur for other reasons. Second, we lack tools for targeted epigenome editing that could be used to validate biological function in perturbation and rescue experiments. The proposed project strives to overcome these limitations through experimental and bioinformatic methods development, with the ambition of making and breaking cancer cells in vitro by introducing defined sets of epigenetic alterations. We will focus on leukemia as our “model cancer” (given its low mutation rate, frequent defects in epigenetic regulators, and availability of excellent functional assays), but the concepts and methods are general. In Aim 1, we will generate epigenome profiles for a human knockout cell collection comprising 100 epigenetic regulators and use the data to functionally annotate thousands of epigenetic alterations observed in large cancer datasets. In Aim 2, we will develop an experimental toolbox for epigenome programming using epigenetic drugs, CRISPR-assisted recruitment of epigenetic modifiers for locus-specific editing, and cell-derived guide RNA libraries for epigenome copying. Finally, in Aim 3 we will explore epigenome programming (methods from Aim 2) of candidate driver events (predictions from Aim 1) with the ultimate goal of converting cancer cells into non-cancer cells and vice versa. In summary, this project will establish a broadly applicable methodology and toolbox for dissecting the functional roles of epigenetic alterations in cancer. Moreover, successful creation of a cancer that is driven purely by epigenetic alterations could challenge our understanding of cancer as a genetic disease.

106	Dr Geoff Higgins	University of Oxford	None	2016-01-01	2019-12-31	Elucidation of novel molecular mechanisms of radiation resistance and their application to clinical radiotherapy trials	Background Radiotherapy is a vital tool in the curative management of cancer but can potentially cause significant side-effects, due to damage to normal tissues surrounding the tumour. In addition, some tumours such as non-small cell lung cancer are relatively radioresistant and have an extremely poor prognosis despite optimal chemoradiotherapy. This can arise due to either intrinsic tumour resistance or hypoxia, which markedly reduces the efficacy of radiotherapy. Radiotherapy could be made more effective if tumours could be rendered more sensitive to radiation without altering the sensitivity of normal tissues. We have therefore previously conducted large-scale siRNA screens that have identified novel genes that alter intrinsic radiosensitivity, and compound screens, which have identified drugs that reduce tumour hypoxia. Aims I plan to develop lead compounds against the targets identified by the intrinsic radiosensitivity siRNA screen for use as clinical radiosensitisers. My research team and I will use the siRNA screen data to devise a gene expression signature to prospectively predict clinical response to radiotherapy and identify patients with resistant disease who are likely to benefit from dose-escalation. We have already identified some compounds routinely used for non-cancer indications for which we have evidence they may reduce tumour hypoxia and therefore increase radiosensitivity. We propose to investigate these in preclinical models and elucidate their mechanisms to establish whether they could be usefully combined with radiotherapy as hypoxia modifying agents. Methods The radiosensitising effects of the novel siRNA targets will be examined in colony formation assays on several tumour and normal tissue lines to identify those that induce tumour specific radiosensitisation. We will investigate the three most promising targets in more detail. CRISPR knockout lines will be produced to understand the mechanisms by which these changes occur. This will include examining the function of the target, and associated changes on DNA repair kinetics, cell cycle distribution, signalling inhibition, and on reactive oxygen species. The proposed radiosensitivity signature will be prospectively tested on a large series of tumour samples from rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant radiotherapy to assess its ability to predict radiotherapy response. This will be based on pathological examination of the resected specimen. How the results will be used The results will be used to develop clinical compounds to augment the efficacy of radiotherapy. We aim to take at least one such compound into an early phase study within the lifetime of this funding cycle.	Cancer Research UK	CCC - Clinician Scientist Fellowship	None	None

It has recently been shown that bacteria and archaea acquire heritable resistance against bacteriophages and plasmids by incorporating short fragments of foreign nucleic acids into genomic clusters of regular interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) loci. These adaptive immune systems rely on short RNAs (crRNAs) that associate with CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins in large ribonucleoprotein surveillance complexes, in which they mediate sequence-specific detection and destruction of invading nucleic acids. Although the function of CRISPR systems is understood in broad terms, the molecular mechanisms of CRISPR interference remain elusive. To obtain molecular insights into the mechanisms underlying crRNA-guided targeting and elimination of foreign nucleic acids, we propose to pursue structural and functional studies of DNA-targeting crRNA-Cas ribonucleoprotein complexes found in several CRISPR system subtypes. In this project, a multidisciplinary approach combining biochemistry, X-ray crystallography and complementary structural approaches with functional assays in vitro and in vivo will allow us to obtain a comprehensive picture of the interference steps in CRISPR pathways. Together, the proposed studies will make a timely contribution to our understanding of RNA-guided genome defence. The DNA-targeting CRISPR systems are found in numerous human pathogens, in which they not only provide phage defence but also counteract the acquisition of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes by horizontal gene transfer. Our future work will thus shed light on the function of these systems in bacterial pathogenesis. In addition to their significance in prokaryotic RNA biology, crRNA-guided DNases have emerged as promising molecular tools for site-specific RNA-guided gene targeting. The proposed structural investigations of RNA-guided CRISPR DNases will provide a mechanistic framework for the continued development of RNA-based genetic engineering technologies.

108	Martin Jinek	University of Zurich	Biochemisches Institut Universität Zürich	2018-01-10	2022-09-30	Molecular mechanisms of CRISPR-associated genome editor nucleases	Over the last five years, RNA-guided endonucleases originating from prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas systems have emerged as powerful and versatile molecular tools for precision genome editing applications in basic research, biotechnology and molecular medicine. The nucleases Cas9 and Cas12a (Cpf1) can be readily programmed using short RNA molecules to generate targeted double-strand DNA breaks in the genome, whose subsequent repair is then exploited to engineer genetic modifications. Despite extensive studies, several aspects of the molecular mechanisms of Cas9 and Cas12a, such as initial target DNA binding and final DNA cleavage, are not fully understood. At the same time, CRISPR-Cas genome editing suffers from limitations such as off-target activity, necessitating on-going technological development to improve the specificity of genome editor nucleases for gene therapeutic applications.Building on our pioneering work in the field, the proposed research will examine the molecular interactions underpinning the activities of Cas9 and Cas12a nucleases, specifically aiming to (i) dissect the mechanisms of Cas9- mediated DNA binding and catalytic activation in Cas9, (ii) determine the structural basis of Cas9âs off-target activity, and (iii) elucidate the DNA cleavage mechanism of Cas12a. To address key steps in the molecular mechanism of Cas9, X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy will be used to determine the structures of Cas9 bound to a partially unwound DNA target and an activated-state Cas9-DNA complex trapped using engineered disulphide cross- links. Off-target activity of Cas9 will be investigated by determining a series of crystal structures of Cas9 bound to bona fide off-target DNAs in order to systematically document off-target interactions such as single-nucleotide mismatches and bulges tolerated by the nuclease. The resulting structural insights will be used to derive a comprehensive off- targeting model with improved predictive power that will subsequently be validated using DNA binding and cleavage assays in vitro and genome editing experiments in vivo. Biochemical investigations of Cas12a will initially define the order and interdependence of strand cleavage events in the canonical cis-cleavage mechanism acting on double-stranded DNA substrates. In turn, X-ray crystallographic analysis of Cas12a in complex with a crRNA guide and a single- stranded DNA target will reveal the conformational activation mechanism responsible for its recently described trans- cleavage activity. Together, these studies will pave the way for subsequent investigations of the catalytic mechanism of target DNA cleavage using time-resolved crystallography.Taking a multidisciplinary approach combining structural studies with biochemical, biophysical and genome editing experiments, the proposed studies will shed light on critical steps in the molecular mechanisms of Cas9 and Cas12a. In doing so, they will not only advance our understanding of their functions but will also provide a mechanistic framework for future structure-guided engineering of these enzymes to improve their efficiency and specificity. In particular, structural analysis of Cas9 off-target activity will be pivotal for developing new off-target prediction and diagnostic tools, as well as engineered high-fidelity Cas9 variants to address the safety of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in genetic and cellular therapies. Taken together, the proposed research will make a substantial impact on the CRISPR field and a timely contribution to harnessing the potential of CRISPR-Cas genome editing for medical applications.

However, their cavefish counterparts cannot and, similar to humans, form a permanent fibrotic scar. This difference in heart regeneration capacity within one species makes Astyanax mexicanus a unique and powerful model to link the ability for heart regeneration directly to the genome using Quantitative Trait Loci analysis. Preliminary QTL results from our previous BHF grant (PG/12/39/29626), combined with transcriptome data, have shown that heart regeneration capability can be linked to a limited number of small loci pointing to crucial differences in cardiac metabolism. The proposed project aims to finalise the QTL analysis by targeted re-sequencing and incorporation of additional data sets, followed by functional validation of the identified mutations using a new F2 generation and CRISPR, combined with metabolic analysis. The results will help identify the most fundamental molecular mechanisms prerequisite to creating a cellular environment favouring heart regeneration over scarring.

110	Prof. Rotem Sorek	WEIZMANN INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE	None	2016-07-01	2021-06-30	Beyond CRISPR: Systematic characterization of novel anti-phage defense systems in the microbial pan-genome	The perpetual arms race between bacteria and phage has resulted in the evolution of efficient resistance systems that protect bacteria from phage infection. Such systems, which include restriction enzymes and CRISPR-Cas, have major influence on the evolution of both bacteria and phage, and have also proven to be invaluable for molecular and biotechnological applications. Although much have been learned on the biology of bacterial defense against phage, more than half of all sequenced bacteria do not contain CRISPR-Cas, and it is estimated that many additional, yet-uncharacterized anti-phage defense systems are encoded in bacterial genomes. The goal of this project is to systematically understand the arsenal of defense mechanisms that are at the disposal of microbes in their struggle against phages. We will computationally analyse new genes enriched in defense islands - areas in the bacterial genomes where multiple defense systems are clustered together – and will use graph-based algorithms to classify individual genes into defense systems. Predicted new systems will be verified experimentally and their mode of action will be studied. In a recent preliminary study on island-residing genes we discovered a novel defense system which we call BREX, providing a proof of concept for our general strategy. In this project we aim to decipher the BREX mechanism of action and to systematically map the molecular capabilities encoded within the anti-phage “defensome”. This project combines computational genomics, synthetic biology, high-throughput robotic assays, and deep genetic and biochemical experiments to discover, verify, and study the properties of novel defense systems. Based on the enormous impact that the discovery of antiviral systems had on modern molecular biology (e.g. restriction enzymes, RNAi, CRISPR), we envision that revealing novel such systems could yield not only major discoveries on phage-bacteria interactions, but also new and exciting molecular tools.

Gene expression profiling demonstrates that many ER target genes are upregulated in MCF7-Y537S cells. We aim to establish whether these key genes associated with ER function have utility as therapeutic targets in metastatic, ESR1 mutant breast cancer. Objectives: 1. Confirm the upregulation of identified nuclear receptors and EGF family members in MCF7-Y537S cells. 2. Investigate whether nuclear receptors and kinase cascades overexpressed in MCF7-Y537S cells are also upregulated in CRISPR-Cas9 engineered metastatic breast cancer cell lines expressing other ESR1 mutations. 3. Determine mechanisms of action of these overexpressed nuclear receptors and kinase cascades in breast cancer cell lines. 4. Investigate whether modulation of the identified nuclear receptor and signaling cascades using synthetic agonists/antagonists provide treatment strategies for this setting. Methodology: A range of techniques will be utilised including RT-qPCR, Western blotting, growth assays, RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq, which are performed frequently by the host laboratory. Scientific and Medical Opportunities: The host laboratory have published extensively on ESR1 mutations and possible means of overcoming resistance. Recently published work includes the generation of breast cancer cell line models for ESR1 mutant metastatic disease, including MCF7-Y537S cells, using CRISPR-Cas9, providing a valuable model for assessing the mechanism of action of ESR1 mutations. We will now extend this work to investigate the function of upregulated ER target genes and evaluate potential therapies in mutant ESR1 cell lines. As clinically evaluated modulating drugs for many of these nuclear receptors and signaling pathways already exist, they could readily be repurposed. We propose that these upregulated genes may be useful therapeutic targets.	Medical Research Council	Fellowship	285219.0	GBP
112	Dr. Edze Westra	University of Exeter	None	2017-01-01	2021-12-31	The evolutionary ecology of bacterial immune mechanisms	Bacteria have a range of immune mechanisms, but it is unclear why this diverse armamentarium evolved. The most important immune mechanisms are (1) Surface Modification (SM) (2) Abortive infection (Abi) (3) Restriction Modification (R-M) (4) CRISPR-Cas and (5) prokaryotic Argonaute (pAgo), all of which can occur as stand-alone mechanisms or in combination. The individual mechanisms differ in key aspects, such as their fitness costs (constitutive versus inducible), specificity (indiscriminate versus specific), the recipient of the benefits (individual versus group), the speed of de novo resistance evolution (rapid versus slow), and heritability of immunity. Here I will take a combined in vitro and in vivo approach to tease apart the variables that drive the evolution of these diverse stand-alone and integrated bacterial immune strategies in nature, and examine their associated co-evolutionary dynamics. I focus on three ecological variables that are consistently important in host-symbiont co-evolution: (1) force of infection (2) spatial structure (3) presence of mutualists (plasmids). First, I will perform in vitro manipulations using Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 variants that carry either single or multiple immune mechanisms. Next, I will sequence metagenomes, transcriptomes and viromes of microbial communities from environments that differ in ecological variables that are important in vitro, to examine their importance in vivo. Key ecological mechanisms identified in the first two parts of the project will be used to guide mesocosm experiments to experimentally confirm that these mechanisms are the drivers of the observed patterns of resistance and co-evolution in nature. Finally, I will share my data with mathematical biologists to generate theoretical models to predict and manipulate the evolution of bacterial immune mechanisms, which will facilitate tailored species protection in agriculture and industry.

This proposal is based on a new in vivo system that I have established to study axonal transport of organelles in wing sensory neurons of Drosophila melanogaster. This system allows, for the first time, organelle transport to be studied in intact adult neurons of living Drosophila over time. Longitudinal studies in this system have revealed a remarkable age-dependent decline in mitochondrial transport. My previous data suggest that experimental upregulation of mitochondrial motility delays age-associated protein aggregation and increases neuronal healthspan. I also found compelling evidence that an evolutionarily conserved signalling pathway can regulate mitochondrial transport in axons of ageing neurons. I propose to exploit this innovative imaging assay to understand the molecular mechanisms linking this specific signalling cascade to mitochondria transport and neuronal ageing. Initially, I will undertake a biochemical characterisation of this signalling pathway in Drosophila, including the identification of downstream targets that regulate transport. By using CRISPR genome engineering and tissue specific RNAi,I will attempt to identify the key regulatory nodes of the pathway. This will be followed by phenotypic analysis of neuronal function. After the Drosophila work, I will test the relevance of our findings in mammalian neurons. These experiments will be performed in cultured mouse motor neurons derived from embryonic stem cells in which mitochondria will be fluorescently labeled with a commercial dye. Finally, I will explore whether chemical activation of the pathway is sufficient to increase mitochondrial trafficking in single neurons of mouse sciatic nerve in vivo. To achieve this, I will use an available transgenic mouse strain, known as MitoMouse, which expresses a fluorescent marker of mitochondria in neurons. In these experiments,mitochondrial transport in young and old mice will be compared before and after challenging the neurons with pathway agonists.

X inactivation is initiated in early development by expression of the noncoding Xist RNA and facilitates dosage compensation for X-linked genes between males and females. Formation of a transcriptionally silent chromosome is recapitulated in mouse embryonic stem cell (ES) cultures, which recently facilitated the identification of silencing factors for Xist. A forward genetic screen in haploid mouse ES cells containing a regulated Xist allele as a selectable system has allowed us to identify candidate genes that are required for gene repression by Xist.This proposal aims to characterize the function of newly identified silencing factors in X inactivation by biochemical and genetic methods. Advancing on the molecular mechanism of X inactivation provides insights into mammalian gene regulation and is relevant for the understanding of the role of chromatin in development and tissue homeostasis.For addressing this question the proposal is divided into two parts that will be pursued in parallel. Subproject A focuses on the investigation of the function of Ubn2 in chromatin regulation. Ubn2 has been identified in our screen as a thus far uncharacterized gene. The homologous Ubn1 protein has been shown to associate with chromatin assembly complexes containing the histone chaperone Hira, which was also identified in our screen. We will investigate the interaction of Ubn2 and Hira and determine binding partners of Ubn2 by proteomics. Subsequently a genetic investigation of Ubn2 complex assembly and function will be performed. To study the function of Ubn2 in mice we will generate a mutation using CRISPR nucleases. Together these experiments will advance the understanding of the function of Ubn2 during formation of the inactive X chromosome and in development. Subproject B aims to characterize genetic interactions of factors that contribute to the initiation of X inactivation by performing combinatorial mutagenesis for discovering overlapping or redundant functions. We will focus on candidates of our screen that give partial phenotypes and for which known homologues exist, which are expressed in ES cells. We will engineer combined mutations of Cdk8 and Cdk19, as well as Ubn1 and Ubn2, and characterize the effect of these double mutations on Xist function. To perform a systematic analysis of silencing factors we will widen the approach to a comprehensive list of genes that have been implicated in the initiation of X inactivation by different laboratories. This approach will take advantage of the cell systems that have been established in our laboratory and viral vectors for expression of two guide RNAs for CRISPR nucleases for increasing sensitivity of the combinatorial screening.Results of both subprojects will comprehensively advance our understanding of the genetic interaction and the hierarchy of pathways in X inactivation. The results are expected to advance our understanding chromatin regulation in mammals and mechanisms for maintaining cell identity in tissue homeostasis and lineage development.

In contrast, there is little understanding of the process by which malaria sporozoites invade hepatocytes, despite the fact that antibody-inducing sporozoite-targeting vaccines are the leading approach to malaria vaccine development. I propose to use the following recently developed and complementary techniques to systematically elucidate ligand-receptor interactions involved in this process: 1. Biochemical identification of ligand-receptor interactions using an existing library of pentameric P. falciparum sporozoite proteins to probe plate-anchored recombinant hepatocyte surface proteins. 2. Genetic identification of receptors essential for in vitro hepatocyte invasion using a CRISPR-Cas9 gene-disruption strategy. A lead panel of 100 abundant candidate receptors will be selected using existing proteomic data, with potential for extension to the complete hepatocyte surface proteome. Identified interactions will be validated via host and parasite manipulations (gene disruption and antibody blockade), both in vitro using primary hepatocyte cultures and in vivo, including use of a humanized mouse model of P. falciparum liver-stage infection. As has been the case for study of merozoite-erythrocyte interactions, I anticipate the project will provide the basis for rational approaches to malaria prophylaxis via disruption of the identified interactions.

Gene augmentation trials for genetic eye disease have disappointed, partly due to difficulties in optimising correct, persistent exogenous gene expression. The possibility of precise, efficient gene correction using genome editing technology for highly genetically heterogenous diseases like RP would overcome these dosage issues. To determine the feasibility of genome editing, we have developed powerful fluorescent reporter mouse models, allowing sensitive readouts of editing events in time and space. Using these, we demonstrated post-natal murine photoreceptors are amenable to genome editing in retinal explants. However, several obstacles exist to making editing a reality in the disease setting. This project aims to: - optimise targeted editing machinery delivery to photoreceptors in vivo; - improve photoreceptor repair efficiency; - explore novel, homology-independent strategies for photoreceptor gene correction; - assess potential for editing technology to rescue vision. To expedite solutions, we propose using our reporter models to develop in vivo photoreceptor editing. We have prepared retinotrophic AAV serotypes containing machinery necessary to edit our models. Following optimisation in reporter models, we will assess repair of disease-causing mutations in our humanised mouse RP models. These experiments will provide vital pilot data towards securing industrial partnerships to translate this technology into clinic.	Wellcome Trust	Seed Award in Science	98979.0	GBP

118	Dr William Scott	MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences	None	2018-03-01	2021-03-31	Clinical Lecturer in Endocrinology	Obesity affects >600M people worldwide, accounts for ~60% of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and ~20% of cardiovascular disease, and causes >3M deaths each year. Better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying obesity and its metabolic complications is essential for development of much needed new therapeutics. Epigenetic programming of gene expression and cell functions in response to genetic and environmental exposures is widely implicated in human obesity and metabolic disease pathogenesis. In exploratory human studies, epigenomic variations and their enzymatic regulators are widely associated with obesity phenotypes and major aetiological risk factors. However, examples of causal epigenomic variants in humans are very limited. A major goal of our research is to identify human epigenomic variations and subsequent responses in gene expression that impact obesity phenotypes, then exploit their therapeutic potential. Our strategy is to use high-throughput genomics to discover cell-type specific epigenomic variations linked to human obesity, then state-of-the-art genome-editing tools to assign causation to these variants and their target genes. The discovery of causal human epigenomic changes is a prerequisite for leveraging the therapeutic potential of these reversible mechanisms of disease. Adipose tissue cell-types are the primary focus of our research because of their key roles in obesity and metabolic disease pathogenesis – excess energy storage (white adipocytes), reduced inducible thermogenic energy expenditure (beige adipocytes), and adipo/cytokines effects on systemic energy balance, inflammation and insulin sensitivity (white and beige adipocytes in cross-talk with macrophages and other immune cells). We have used integrated genomic strategies to discover alterations in adipocyte DNA methylation, an important epigenetic mechanism, robustly associated with human obesity and their predicted effector transcripts (cis- target genes). These loci may contribute to human obesity phenotypes if DNA methylation actively regulates the expression of cis- target genes with critical adipocyte functions. Our immediate aim is to establish the cause-and-effect relationships between DNA methylation, cis- target gene expression and disease phenotype, and the underlying mechanisms-of-action, at these loci. Our strategy is to combine complementary lines of evidence from human functional genomics (e.g. targeted bisulfite sequencing, Capture HiC, transcription factor motif analyses), in vitro epigenetic editing (CRISPR-cas9) and in vivo mouse genetic manipulation (Cre-Lox). In parallel, we are developing single cell sequencing approaches to investigate epigenomic and transcriptomic mechanisms in other major adipose tissue cell types – macrophages, other immune and stromovascular cells, adipocyte precursors – underlying human obesity, metabolic dysfunction and weight loss. By intersecting results from epigenomics, genetics, molecular signaling and physiology, our work will deliver new insights into mechanisms of disease in human adipocytes, and a range of translational research targets for obesity and T2D.

Recent studies in CHD patients suggest that specific cardiac malformations may be caused by mutations in genes involved in cytoskeletal remodelling. The actin cytoskeleton exhibits regionalised architectural rearrangements during heart development, and blocking specific interactions disrupts heart looping. In this fellowship I will identify the key cytoskeletal regulators that drive the actin cytoskeleton remodelling required for cardiac morphogenesis during development, and will identify the cellular mechanisms by which they promote tissue remodelling in the heart. I have developed RNA tomography as a technique to identify regulators of cytoskeletal remodelling under temporal and spatial control in the heart. I will use CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing to generate zebrafish mutants of selected candidate regulators, and generate transgenic lines expressing fluorescently labelled candidate cytoskeletal proteins. Using high-resolution imaging I will link phenotypic analysis of heart looping morphogenesis in wild type and mutant zebrafish embryos with altered actin and myosin dynamics, localisation of cytoskeletal regulators, and cell shape changes during heart development. Collectively this will enable me to define the role of the cytoskeleton in early heart morphogenesis, and provide insights into the origins of congenital heart defects.&lt;/P&gt;	British Heart Foundation	Fellowship	667864.0	GBP

Many genetic pathways have been implicated in specific aspects of cardiac development, including Notch and Rac1 signalling. Dock6 and EOGT regulate Rac1 activity and Notch signalling respectively, and homozygous recessive mutations in either gene causes congenital heart defects in patients with Adams-Oliver Syndrome (AOS), however the mechanisms by which these genes drive heart morphogenesis through regulation of Notch and Rac1 is unknown. We will interrogate the roles of dock6 and eogt in cardiac development using CRISPR-Cas9 based genome modification to generate zebrafish mutant by deleting the promoter elements of each gene, and introducing disease-specific genetic lesions. By characterising specific hallmarks of cardiac morphogenesis in these zebrafish models we will define the how the regulatory roles for these genes in Rac1 and Notch signalling promote cardiac development. We will investigate specifically which Rac1-dependent processes are disrupted in dock6 mutants. This work will provide novel insights into how these conserved signalling pathways are regulated during cardiac development, and improve understanding of the disease mechanisms underlying the congenital heart defects in AOS patients.

In recent years, the Hippo signaling pathway was found to play an evolutionarily conserved key role in organ size determination through regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis and stemness. More importantly, deregulation of the Hippo pathway underlies tumorigenesis of many human cancers. In response to signals such as mechanical stress, the Hippo pathway Mst1/2-Lats1/2 kinase cascade phosphorylates and inhibits YAP and TAZ transcription co-activators, therefore regulates gene expression and tissue growth. Nevertheless, the subcellular localization of Hippo signaling is largely unknown. In this project, through collaborative efforts, we will tag all endogenous Hippo pathway proteins using CRISPR-mediated homologous recombination in both mammalian cells and Drosophila. This resource will allow mechanistic and functional analysis of subcellular spatial dynamics of Hippo pathway proteins upon physiological stimulation and during development or regeneration. The proposed work will not only address an important albeit obscure area of Hippo signaling and organ size control but will also demonstrate the general value of CRISPR-mediated protein tagging technique in solving the long-standing difficulty of cell signaling spatial dynamics investigation. This work will also open new directions for investigating the Hippo pathway in human cancer and regenerative medicine.	The Academy of Medical Sciences	Newton Advanced Fellowship	111000.0	GBP

The obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii requires iron however little is known about iron in this parasite. My goals in this project are to determine mechanisms for sensing, acquisition and usage of iron by the parasite. Using a combination of biochemical and genetic techniques I will determine the source of parasite iron and how it modulates the iron acquisition in the host. To investigate if the parasite can respond to iron, I performed RNAseq on parasites grown under high iron or with iron removed and determined genes transcriptionally regulated by iron, including several genes with predicted roles in iron transport and metabolism. Although several iron-related genes have been predicted in Toxoplasma, none have been studied and it is likely that other, more divergent, genes exist. To find novel genes required for survival under low and high iron conditions, I will perform genome-wide pooled CRISPR screens. Genes with changing phenotype scores across different iron conditions will be characterised through genetic and biochemical assays to understand their function in parasite pathogenesis. This project seeks to use novel chemical and genetic strategies to understand and characterise the interactions between iron and Toxoplasma gondii.

We undertook the first application of genome modified T cells expressing a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) against CD19 to successfully treat infant B cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) in 2015. Cells were transduced with a lentiviral vector to express CAR19 and then further modified using TALENS to disrupt T cell receptor (TCR) and CD52. Genome editing technology is evolving rapidly and we have developed a self-inactivating lentiviral vector that tightly couples CAR expression with CRISPR guides through a hybrid 3' long terminal repeat region (LTR). Subsequent electroporation of Cas9 mRNA results in transient CRISPR mediated DNA cleavage and highly efficient disruption of target loci. Further downstream processing enables depletion of residual TCR+ cells and yields highly homogenous (>99% CAR+TCR-) populations. Furthermore, we have developed an automated process with selection techniques to generate CAR-T cells from umbilical cord blood T cells as well as conventional peripheral blood lymphocyte harvests from healthy donors. In vivo, human-murine anti-leukaemia modelling has confirmed functional integrity of CAR+TCR- cells, and found these were less prone to exhaustion compared to TCR+ cells. Extensive molecular screening for off-target events using Digenome analysis, targeted next-generation and whole-genome sequencing was undertaken. We now propose a Phase 1 study to treat children with relapsed refractory CD19+ leukaemia as a proof of concept application of CRISPR genome modified T cells. The therapy will aim to induce molecular remission & thereby secure eligibility for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. We will assess disease responses, relapse, survival as well as complications including cytokine release syndrome and graft versus host disease. Multiple additional therapeutic applications are envisaged upon completion.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	1290748.0	GBP
124	Mr Kristoffer Johansen	University of Cambridge	None	2016-10-01	2020-09-30	Signaling by novel PI3K effector proteins in T cells	The proposed research project seeks to describe and characterise the roles of novel PIP3-binding proteins in T cells by knocking out PIP3-binding proteins identified during a RNAseq screen with CRISPR/Cas9 in T cell lines, primary T cells, and eventually in vivo in mouse models. By using functional assays, such as ICAM-binding assays, intracellular IFN&gamma; staining, and APC-T cell conjugation assays, the identified proteins will be characterized. Key goals of the project will be: 1) To establish techniques for knocking out the identified PIP3-binding proteins in primary Tcells. 2) To functionally analyse the knockout T cells from goal 1 and identify novel PIP-binding proteins with roles in T cell migration, adhesion, or activation. 3) To investigate a select few novel PIP3-binding proteins in vivo either by bone marrow reconstitution with KO cells, T cell transfer models, or complete conditional knockout as established with CRISPR/Cas9 at the Babraham Institute.I expect that we will help elucidate on the signalling pathways involved in T cell function, and thereby potentially gain knowledge on proteins downstream in the PI3K signalling pathway that potentially could be pharmaceutical targets in cancers, autoimmune, and infectious diseases.

I will perform functional characterization of RA risk loci with the aim of translating GWAS findings into biological disease mechanisms and suggesting therapeutic targets. My key goals are: 1. To identify the genes that cause RA. I will identify chromatin interactions between RA loci and their targets using capture Hi-C in primary CD4+ T-cells and synovial fibroblasts from RA patients. I will explore whether associated SNP genotypes are correlated with differential expression of the genes they interact with. 2. To elucidate the mechanism by which RA-associated SNPs alter their target genes. Regulatory elements containing disease-associated SNPs will be identified in primary cells from patients and their functional importance will be verified using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. 3. To translate research findings into patient benefit. Identified causal genes and pathways will be intersected with known drug targets to identify existing drugs whose safety and efficacy has been proven in other diseases and which could potentially be re-purposed to treat RA.

There are 390 million infections annually, with 96 million cases of dengue fever and 500,000 cases of the potentially fatal dengue haemorrhagic fever. No antivirals are available, and the only licensed vaccine has mixed efficacy. Mosquito control is therefore important for reducing the global disease burden. Vector immunity restricts DENV replication and transmission. However, we showed that DENV-2 inhibits the IMD pathway, an NF-kB response analogous to human TNF receptor signalling, in cell lines derived from Aedes aegypti, the major DENV vector. This grant will (i) characterise the molecular mechanism of DENV-2's IMD antagonism; (ii) evaluate the impact IMD responses have on DENV-2 evolution; (iii) establish the relevance to diverse DENV serotypes and transmission potential in vivo. Aim 1 exploits our unique IMD assays and track record in Ae. aegypti proteomics to identify which DENV-2 protein antagonises IMD activation, along with its cellular targets. In aim 2, which is not dependent on aim 1, we will experimentally evolve DENV-2 in our first-in-field IMD-deficient CRISPR cell lines to assess the impact on the viral quasispecies (the total population of viral sequences) and identify viral sequences required for IMD antagonism. Results will be validated in an established reverse genetics system. Aim 3 will establish real-world relevance by testing transmission potential in mosquitoes infected with wild-type DENV-2 and IMD-sensitive mutants from aim 2. Key experiments will also be repeated with divergent DENV serotypes. We will thus define virus-vector interactions modulating DENV transmission, with implications for ongoing epidemics and future opportunities for vector-targeted control strategies. This will be the first characterisation of mosquito NF-kB evasion for any arbovirus.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	451057.0	GBP

Gene augmentation trials for genetic eye disease have disappointed, partly due to difficulties in optimising correct, persistent exogenous gene expression. The possibility of precise, efficient gene correction using genome editing technology for highly genetically heterogenous diseases like RP would overcome these dosage issues. To determine the feasibility of genome editing, we have developed powerful fluorescent reporter mouse models, allowing sensitive readouts of editing events in time and space. Using these, we demonstrated post-natal murine photoreceptors are amenable to genome editing in retinal explants. However, several obstacles exist to making editing a reality in the disease setting. This project aims to: - optimise targeted editing machinery delivery to photoreceptors in vivo; - improve photoreceptor repair efficiency; - explore novel, homology-independent strategies for photoreceptor gene correction; - assess potential for editing technology to rescue vision. To expedite solutions, we propose using our reporter models to develop in vivo photoreceptor editing. We have prepared retinotrophic AAV serotypes containing machinery necessary to edit our models.

The proposed experiments will primarily be performed in human U2OS osteosarcoma cells. We have U2OS cells for inducible PrimPol depletion and CRISPR-deleted for PARP1 and PARP2, and will generate further U2OS lines for combined depletion/expression of PrimPol for mutagenesis studies. BPDE adducts will be induced using nanomolar concentrations of commercially available (+)-anti-BPDE and adduct levels will be quantified by HPLC. PrimPol exerts primase-, polymerase-, and TLS activity and plasmids expressing separation-of-function variants of PrimPol will be used to distinguish the contributions of these activities to BPDE-induced recombination. PrimPol-dependent ssDNA formation and resection will be assessed by immunostaining for native BrdU, RPA, and phospho-Serine S4/8 RPA, as well as S1 endonuclease-modified fibre assay and SMART fibre assay. Impact on replication fork progression will be measured using standard DNA fibre analyses. We will further decipher the mechanisms of ssDNA gap resection and RAD51 loading at BPDE adducts using chemical inhibitors of resection factors and recombination mediators such as MRE11 and PARP1/2. Other resection proteins and recombination mediators such as BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD52, DNA2, and Exo1 will be siRNA-targeted. Initiation of recombination will be measured by RAD51 foci formation and chromatin recruitment, as well as proximity ligation assay. iPOND may be used as backup if needed. We will investigate potential competition between PrimPol-dependent recombination and translesion synthesis by DNA polymerase kappa. This will involve siRNA depleting Pol kappa and quantify eGFP-Pol kappa foci formation. Impacts of PrimPol-dependent recombination on mutagenesis will be measured by classic mutagenesis assays e.g. HPRT, recombination assays such as sister chromatid exchange and whole genome sequencing followed by bioinformatics analyses.

This is partly due to our very limited knowledge of how multiple variations combine to create phenotypes. There is a clear need for a systematic, perturbation-based approach to study the phenotypic consequences of genetic variants in different genomic and environmental contexts. Previous efforts have primarily used loss-of-function or overexpression approaches, but it is known that subtle, naturally occurring variants have the most relevance for complex, quantitative traits. Our proposal aims to dissect these effects by systematically engineering and functionally profiling naturally occurring single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertion/deletion polymorphisms (indels) in the S. cerevisiae species in three diverse genetic backgrounds. To generate such an unprecedented collection, we will apply a high-throughput CRISPR approach that allows rapid isolation of sequence-verified strains. DNA barcodes integrated into the genome of each strain will enable pooled, competitive growth, which will reveal how variants modulate fitness as a function of environment and genetic background. We will test our collection for pairwise and higher order interactions, assay their impact on cellular processes and dissect pleiotropic roles of highly connected genes. Our work will circumvent the key limitations in current high-throughput genome editing screens and enable the largest interrogation of the functional impact of genetic variation in different environmental and genetic contexts to date. The combined insights and tools generated by our work will aid in developing predictive models of the effects of genetic variation within specific environmental and biological contexts, providing guiding principles for understanding the consequences of human genetic variation.

It enables students to directly engage in frontier research. Participating faculty has acquired a total of 43 ERC grants in the life sciences, and VBC PhD students have co-authored milestone publications like the discovery of tracrRNA, the Cas9/CRISPR mechanism or the establishment of cerebral organoids from human pluripotent stem cells. Founded in 1993, the programme has produced a strong track record of graduates that have accepted leading positions in science, science management or private research. Moreover, the VBC PhD programme developed a thorough training and education programme that builds on the PhD curriculum for life sciences of the University of Vienna, from which students obtain their degree. Research into Stem cells and Development is one of the core research areas on the Vienna BioCenter, connecting basic research groups across the different research institutes and faculties participating in the VBC PhD programme. The proposed research in this proposal will strengthen two central research directions of this consortium: (i) The first research direction focuses on cellular programmes and aims to define the molecular mechanisms that drive stem cells to into lineage-specific programmes, or – conversely – permit differentiated cells to de-differentiate. This also includes the question how the homeostasis between stem cells and differentiated cells is regulated on the tissue level. (ii) The second research direction investigates how stem cells form whole tissues, and how this process can be recapitulated and molecularly dissected ex vivo, building on the recent breakthroughs in organoid culture and genome editing. The proposed PhD projects of the consortium match these central research directions, and take full advantage of the excellent research environment available to the students. This covers state-of-the-art facilities, including the newly founded Stem cell core facility (ISCCF) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences that will be a central player for stem cell expertise and training to the consortium. Likewise, the consortium will benefit from the association of a strong bioinformatics group providing and developing methodology for large data analyses. This will meet foreseeable challenges posed by the advent of massive parallel cellular transcriptomics and other high-throughput technologies. Finally, the students will profit from the world-class science performed in interfacing research areas, such as (i) RNA biology, gene regulation and epigenetics (ii) molecular medicine or (iii) neuroscience; and from the list of outstanding scientists that visit the campus as part of the VBC lecture series. Together, this will provide the students funded by this proposal with an excellent training and research environment in which they can mature as scientists, follow their curiosity, and contribute to original research discoveries that will break new grounds in distinct areas of stem cell research.

Gene expression profiling demonstrates that many ER target genes are upregulated in MCF7-Y537S cells. We aim to establish whether these key genes associated with ER function have utility as therapeutic targets in metastatic, ESR1 mutant breast cancer. Objectives: 1. Confirm the upregulation of identified nuclear receptors and EGF family members in MCF7-Y537S cells. 2. Investigate whether nuclear receptors and kinase cascades overexpressed in MCF7-Y537S cells are also upregulated in CRISPR-Cas9 engineered metastatic breast cancer cell lines expressing other ESR1 mutations. 3. Determine mechanisms of action of these overexpressed nuclear receptors and kinase cascades in breast cancer cell lines. 4. Investigate whether modulation of the identified nuclear receptor and signaling cascades using synthetic agonists/antagonists provide treatment strategies for this setting. Methodology: A range of techniques will be utilised including RT-qPCR, Western blotting, growth assays, RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq, which are performed frequently by the host laboratory. Scientific and Medical Opportunities: The host laboratory have published extensively on ESR1 mutations and possible means of overcoming resistance. Recently published work includes the generation of breast cancer cell line models for ESR1 mutant metastatic disease, including MCF7-Y537S cells, using CRISPR-Cas9, providing a valuable model for assessing the mechanism of action of ESR1 mutations. We will now extend this work to investigate the function of upregulated ER target genes and evaluate potential therapies in mutant ESR1 cell lines. As clinically evaluated modulating drugs for many of these nuclear receptors and signaling pathways already exist, they could readily be repurposed. We propose that these upregulated genes may be useful therapeutic targets.	Medical Research Council	Fellowship	285219.0	GBP

AR mutations enabling receptor function in advanced disease and the generation of splice variants (AR-Vs) that are refractory to clinically-approved anti-androgens, is common in CRPC and enables retention of the transforming activity of the receptor even in the presence of next generation drugs such as Enzalutamide and Abiraterone. Although we have information on the expression of receptor mutants and variants in advanced disease, the mechansims that regulate these aberrantly-functioning proteins, and their downstream gene targets, is markedly understudied. Background: Using CRISPR-based approaches to model relevant mutant ARs in cell lines, we will provide key transcriptomic profiles of these proteins in advanced disease. Additionally, post-translational modifications (PTMs) of the AR play important roles in regulating full-length receptor, but their involvement in controlling the activity of AR-Vs is unknown. We will identify and characterise PTMs of AR-Vs in cell line models of CRPC. Expected Outcomes: Improved modelling of AR mutations and analysis of AR-V regulation by upstream signalling cascades will highlight key biomarkers and targets for therapeutic intervention in advanced prostate cancer patients.

In addition, some tumours such as non-small cell lung cancer are relatively radioresistant and have an extremely poor prognosis despite optimal chemoradiotherapy. This can arise due to either intrinsic tumour resistance or hypoxia, which markedly reduces the efficacy of radiotherapy. Radiotherapy could be made more effective if tumours could be rendered more sensitive to radiation without altering the sensitivity of normal tissues. We have therefore previously conducted large-scale siRNA screens that have identified novel genes that alter intrinsic radiosensitivity, and compound screens, which have identified drugs that reduce tumour hypoxia. Aims I plan to develop lead compounds against the targets identified by the intrinsic radiosensitivity siRNA screen for use as clinical radiosensitisers. My research team and I will use the siRNA screen data to devise a gene expression signature to prospectively predict clinical response to radiotherapy and identify patients with resistant disease who are likely to benefit from dose-escalation. We have already identified some compounds routinely used for non-cancer indications for which we have evidence they may reduce tumour hypoxia and therefore increase radiosensitivity. We propose to investigate these in preclinical models and elucidate their mechanisms to establish whether they could be usefully combined with radiotherapy as hypoxia modifying agents. Methods The radiosensitising effects of the novel siRNA targets will be examined in colony formation assays on several tumour and normal tissue lines to identify those that induce tumour specific radiosensitisation. We will investigate the three most promising targets in more detail. CRISPR knockout lines will be produced to understand the mechanisms by which these changes occur. This will include examining the function of the target, and associated changes on DNA repair kinetics, cell cycle distribution, signalling inhibition, and on reactive oxygen species. The proposed radiosensitivity signature will be prospectively tested on a large series of tumour samples from rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant radiotherapy to assess its ability to predict radiotherapy response. This will be based on pathological examination of the resected specimen. How the results will be used The results will be used to develop clinical compounds to augment the efficacy of radiotherapy. We aim to take at least one such compound into an early phase study within the lifetime of this funding cycle.	Cancer Research UK	CCC - Clinician Scientist Fellowship	None	None

X inactivation is initiated in early development by expression of the noncoding Xist RNA and facilitates dosage compensation for X-linked genes between males and females. Formation of a transcriptionally silent chromosome is recapitulated in mouse embryonic stem cell (ES) cultures, which recently facilitated the identification of silencing factors for Xist. A forward genetic screen in haploid mouse ES cells containing a regulated Xist allele as a selectable system has allowed us to identify candidate genes that are required for gene repression by Xist.This proposal aims to characterize the function of newly identified silencing factors in X inactivation by biochemical and genetic methods. Advancing on the molecular mechanism of X inactivation provides insights into mammalian gene regulation and is relevant for the understanding of the role of chromatin in development and tissue homeostasis.For addressing this question the proposal is divided into two parts that will be pursued in parallel. Subproject A focuses on the investigation of the function of Ubn2 in chromatin regulation. Ubn2 has been identified in our screen as a thus far uncharacterized gene. The homologous Ubn1 protein has been shown to associate with chromatin assembly complexes containing the histone chaperone Hira, which was also identified in our screen. We will investigate the interaction of Ubn2 and Hira and determine binding partners of Ubn2 by proteomics. Subsequently a genetic investigation of Ubn2 complex assembly and function will be performed. To study the function of Ubn2 in mice we will generate a mutation using CRISPR nucleases. Together these experiments will advance the understanding of the function of Ubn2 during formation of the inactive X chromosome and in development. Subproject B aims to characterize genetic interactions of factors that contribute to the initiation of X inactivation by performing combinatorial mutagenesis for discovering overlapping or redundant functions. We will focus on candidates of our screen that give partial phenotypes and for which known homologues exist, which are expressed in ES cells. We will engineer combined mutations of Cdk8 and Cdk19, as well as Ubn1 and Ubn2, and characterize the effect of these double mutations on Xist function. To perform a systematic analysis of silencing factors we will widen the approach to a comprehensive list of genes that have been implicated in the initiation of X inactivation by different laboratories. This approach will take advantage of the cell systems that have been established in our laboratory and viral vectors for expression of two guide RNAs for CRISPR nucleases for increasing sensitivity of the combinatorial screening.Results of both subprojects will comprehensively advance our understanding of the genetic interaction and the hierarchy of pathways in X inactivation. The results are expected to advance our understanding chromatin regulation in mammals and mechanisms for maintaining cell identity in tissue homeostasis and lineage development.

In contrast, there is little understanding of the process by which malaria sporozoites invade hepatocytes, despite the fact that antibody-inducing sporozoite-targeting vaccines are the leading approach to malaria vaccine development. I propose to use the following recently developed and complementary techniques to systematically elucidate ligand-receptor interactions involved in this process: 1. Biochemical identification of ligand-receptor interactions using an existing library of pentameric P. falciparum sporozoite proteins to probe plate-anchored recombinant hepatocyte surface proteins. 2. Genetic identification of receptors essential for in vitro hepatocyte invasion using a CRISPR-Cas9 gene-disruption strategy. A lead panel of 100 abundant candidate receptors will be selected using existing proteomic data, with potential for extension to the complete hepatocyte surface proteome. Identified interactions will be validated via host and parasite manipulations (gene disruption and antibody blockade), both in vitro using primary hepatocyte cultures and in vivo, including use of a humanized mouse model of P. falciparum liver-stage infection. As has been the case for study of merozoite-erythrocyte interactions, I anticipate the project will provide the basis for rational approaches to malaria prophylaxis via disruption of the identified interactions.

Lengthening or shortening of the cell cycle is a fundamental disease mechanism in development, ageing and cancer. It is likely that many developmental diseases are caused at least in large part by early defects of cell proliferation and many studies are now using mouse models of these conditions to explore this hypothesis in numerous systems. Mouse cell cycle kinetics are often investigated using thymidine analogues such as BrdU - incorporated into DNA during S-phase. These techniques rely on multiple injections or the surgical implantation of mini osmotic pumps to deliver the analogue. Recently, genetically encoded cell cycle probes have been developed and these are key to refining proliferation assays because they can be combined with live-imaging efficiently generating large datasets from fewer animals. Of these, the best existing model is the R26Fucci2aR (developed by RLM) reporter model because of the 1:1 stoichiometry of probe expression and the ability to control expression spatio-temporally with Cre-recombinase. However a number of shortcomings still exist: 1) It does not discriminate S-phase from G2/M-phases; 2) It does not discriminate G1 from quiescent cells in G0. 3) The probes are technically difficult to detect with antibodies limiting them to live studies. In order to address these shortcomings we will develop a next generation Quiescence and Cell Cycle Indicator (QuCCI) and Rosa26 QuCCi knock-in reporter mouse. QuCCi incorporates the the tried and tested probes p27K-,hCdt1(Cy-) and hGem(1/110) fused to mCerulean, mCherry and mVenus respectively including unique epitope tags. QuCCi can discriminate between cells in G1, S, G2/M and G0. The PhD student will join an existing team across Lancaster University (UK), Edinburgh University (UK) and McGill University (Canada) who have already committed time and resources to the development of the model. The team that we have assembled to support the studentship is perfectly placed to facilitate the project because we have extensive experience and proven track records in developing multicistronic constructs and cell lines (Dr. Mort, Dr. Ford), generating transgenic mice using CRISPR/Cas9 technology including the insertion of large constructs using injection into two-cell embryos (Dr. Yamanaka, Dr. Cowan) and in performing image analysis and quantitative imaging techniques (Dr. Mort, Prof. O’Shea).

To address this problem, our project aims to: 1. To understand and compare how artemisinin sensitive and resistant parasites respond to known transmission-blocking drugs 2. To develop the methodology to quantitatively assess male and female gametocyte functional viability in malarial patients 3. To adapt our Pf DGFA methodology to a form amenable for large scale implementation for transmission-blocking clinical trials We will combine established gametocyte producing P. falciparum artemisinin-sensitive and -resistant isolates with our existing validated in vitro transmission-blocking assay (Pf Dual Gamete Formation Assay - Pf DGFA) to initially determine whether primaquine (PQ) or methylene blue (MB) (and their metabolites) show modulated transmission-blocking activity in a resistant background. As a standardised control, we will also generate a panel of lab strain parasites containing known mutations linked to artemisinin resistance by CRISPR. To extend this investigation we will also compare 34 known transmission-blocking molecules in the Pf DGFA in both sensitive and resistant backgrounds. Taking our in vitro data on PQ and MB transmission-blocking efficacy, we will repeat our investigation using ex vivo parasites taken from malarial patients under PQ/MB treatment. Finally, we will adapt the Pf DGFA into a form amenable for evaluation of transmission-blocking field trials. Our project aims to deliver evidence-based recommendations about the use of PQ and MB for controlling the spread of artemisinin resistant parasites; a screening platform to evaluate current and future antimalarials for efficacy against artemisinin resistant parasites; and a robust tool to accurately measure transmission-blocking during field trials.

The molecular basis for this ethnic difference in disease incidence is unknown. This project tests the hypothesis that SNPs affecting the expression of putative stress granule components SRP14-AS1 and TDP43 predispose to Ewing sarcoma (ES). ES is characterized by a highly recurrent chromosomal aberration, a EWS-ETS (predominantly EWS-FLI1) gene rearrangement. The resulting fusion gene encodes for an aberrant ETS transcription factor which drives sarcomagenesis. In a large genome-wide association study, three ES susceptibility loci were previously discovered in intergenic regions of chromosomes 1p36.22, 10q21 and 15q15. Our preliminary results indicate that two susceptibility loci on chromosomes 1 and 15 affect putative components of insoluble cytoplasmic foci which form during early cellular stress response, the stress granules. As part of the FWF-funded ERA-NET project “PROVABES”, we interrogated the functional relevance of the ES susceptibility region on 15q15. By epigenome mapping, EWS-FLI1 ChIP-seq, and reporter gene assays we found this locus to localize to an EWS-FLI1 bound enhancer. By CRISPR/Cas9 mediated bi-allelic deletion we were able to link this enhancer to expression of the long non-coding RNA SRP14-AS1, which is transcribed from the bidirectional SRP14 promoter. SRP14 encodes an RNA binding protein and component of the signal recognition particle and of stress granules. While SRP14-AS1 expression levels were low under adherent growth conditions, they markedly increased upon detachment stress and surface-independent tumor cell growth. Modulation of SRP14-AS1 expression by siRNA or bi-allelic enhancer deletion significantly reduced soft agar colony formation of ES cells without affecting growth under adherent culture conditions. Preliminary results suggest that SRP14-AS1 binds to SRP14 and that SRP14-AS1 depletion reduces stress granule formation similar to TDP43 depletion. TDP43 is encoded by the TARDBP gene in the expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) harboring the ES susceptibility locus on chromosome 1p36. This study will therefore interrogate the role of stress granules in EWS-FLI1 driven ES pathogenesis and the mechanisms by which variations in SRP14-AS1 and TDP43 expression affect ES susceptibility. In a comprehensive work program we will explore the eQTL properties of SNPs in the regulatory region driving SRP14-AS1, chromatin conformation changes and the mechanism of transcriptional SRP14-AS1 induction upon cellular stress, the SRP14-AS1 associated proteome and its relation to protein translation regulation and stress granule composition, and the role of a functional interaction between EWS-FLI1, SRP14-AS1 and TDP43 in ES tumorigenesis. Finally, we will explore SRP14-AS1 expression as a potential predictive marker for ES susceptibility, and test stress granule inhibitory compounds for their anti-tumor activity. This project will therefore provide unprecedented insights into a novel mechanism of lncRNA mediated tumor predisposition.	Austrian Science Fund FWF	Stand-Alone Project	364795.2	EUR

Despite their prevalence, the concrete functional roles of these alterations are not well understood, for two reasons: First, cancer samples tend to carry many correlated epigenetic alterations, making it difficult to statistically distinguish relevant driver events from those that co-occur for other reasons. Second, we lack tools for targeted epigenome editing that could be used to validate biological function in perturbation and rescue experiments. The proposed project strives to overcome these limitations through experimental and bioinformatic methods development, with the ambition of making and breaking cancer cells in vitro by introducing defined sets of epigenetic alterations. We will focus on leukemia as our “model cancer” (given its low mutation rate, frequent defects in epigenetic regulators, and availability of excellent functional assays), but the concepts and methods are general. In Aim 1, we will generate epigenome profiles for a human knockout cell collection comprising 100 epigenetic regulators and use the data to functionally annotate thousands of epigenetic alterations observed in large cancer datasets. In Aim 2, we will develop an experimental toolbox for epigenome programming using epigenetic drugs, CRISPR-assisted recruitment of epigenetic modifiers for locus-specific editing, and cell-derived guide RNA libraries for epigenome copying. Finally, in Aim 3 we will explore epigenome programming (methods from Aim 2) of candidate driver events (predictions from Aim 1) with the ultimate goal of converting cancer cells into non-cancer cells and vice versa. In summary, this project will establish a broadly applicable methodology and toolbox for dissecting the functional roles of epigenetic alterations in cancer. Moreover, successful creation of a cancer that is driven purely by epigenetic alterations could challenge our understanding of cancer as a genetic disease.

Recent evidence shows that resident macrophages can originate from embryonic progenitors and be maintained in tissues long term by local proliferation independently of monocytes. This self-renewal ability, however, appears to decline with age, with potentially major consequences for the response to infection, the resolution of inflammation and the ability for tissue regeneration. Understanding the decline of self-renewal in the aging macrophage may thus hold key elements for maintaining healthy tissue integrity. Drawing from analogies to stem cell self-renewal we want to decipher the molecular and cellular parameters of macrophage self-renewal and its decline with age. We want to understand the age-associated changes in gene expression and epigenetic identity of tissue macrophage populations with the ultimate goal to reverse age dependent decline in self-renewal and function. Results from my laboratory have identified transcription factors that control the access to a network of self-renewal genes that are also used in stem cells. Using several complementary genetic mouse models tapping into this network we want to investigate whether its activation in resident macrophage population in vivo can rejuvenate their self-renewal capacity and revert aging related changes. These approaches will be complemented by unbiased genome wide screens in vivo using latest generation CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology to identify new signaling pathways guiding macrophage self-renewal and aging. Using innovate combinations of genetics and adoptive transfer protocols we will test whether this knowledge can be employed to reverse macrophage dependent loss of immune competence and failed tissue regeneration with age. Our results will lead to new general insight and potential novel cellular therapies for degenerative diseases.	European Research Council	Advanced Grant	2499994.0	EUR

Checkpoint blockade immunotherapies successfully unleash the potential of pre-existing T cell responses against tumor antigens. However, the subversion of the immunogenic function of classical dendritic cells (cDC1s and cDC2s) by the tumor micro-environment constrain the development of such immuneT cell responses. Therefore, antigen delivery using adoptive transfer of cDCs is a promising immunotherapeutic approach. CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) have been shown to generate cDC1s (Clec9a+XCR1+). Current culture protocols, however, fail to generate bona fide cDC2s (CD14-BDCA1+). In addition, the rarity of circulating CD34+ HSPCs, might limit their implementation in immunotherapy. Human induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) can be differentiated in CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors and represent a potentially inexhaustible source of immunologically compatible cells for cellular immunotherapies. The over-arching goal of this project is to generate improved methods for the generation of both cDC1s and cDC2s subsets amenable to a cDC vaccine approach in cancer patients. Specifically, we aim: a) To develop a method to efficiently generate cDC1 and cDC2s, from CD34+ HSPCs or from iPSCs. To this end we have developed a unique approach based on co-culture of progenitors with engineered mesenchymal stromal cell lines (eMSCs) delivering defined combinations of hematopoietic growth factors. b) To perform genetic modification of iPSCs to improve cDCs immunogenicity. To this end, we will use CRISPR-Cas9 for loss-of function of regulatory “immune checkpoints” like PD-L1 in iPSCs. c) To develop pre-clinical model for the evaluation of T cell activation by cDCs in vivo. We will use immune-deficient NOD-SCID-gc mice transgenic for human MHC I (NSG.A2) reconstituted with polyclonal or oligo-clonal autologous T cell repertoires (using T cells transduced for a TCR anti-MART1/HLA-A2). Using this system, we will evaluate the ability of autologous cDC2s, cDC1s, or a mixture of both to induce anti-tumoral CD8+ T cell responses against the MART1 melanoma antigen.

144	Professor Simon Reed	CARDIFF UNIVERSITY	None	2020-01-01	2022-12-31	INDUCE-seq: a novel tool for next generation risk assessment	Genotoxicity testing relies on the quantitative measurement of adverse effects, such as chromosome aberrations, micronuclei, and mutations, resulting from primary DNA damage, especially the DNA double strand break (DSB). Ideally, assays will detect DNA damage and cellular responses with high sensitivity, reliability, and throughput. Current assays involve in vivo cell-based analysis of surrogate markers for breaks, such as the gamma H2AX focus assay, or the tail moment of DNA from the Comet assay. The main regulatory assay for the detection of DNA damage caused by clastogens and aneugens is the animal-based rodent in vivo micronucleus assay. Novel next generation DNA sequencing technologies now make it possible to revolutionise the way we test for factors affecting the stability of the genome, and this could also include the testing of chemicals and compounds generated by humans, and those found in the natural environment. Furthermore, novel genome editing technologies offer the possibility of novel therapeutic modalities, which also need to be safety-tested for their potential genotoxic effects due to the established problem of 'off-target' editing. In this regard, we recently developed a novel method to capture DSBs induced by CRISPR-Cas9 editing of the genome, with a view to measuring such off-target editing. Remarkably, we have determined that the method, which we call INDUCE-Seq, is exquisitely sensitive to detecting DSBs in the genome over a very broad dynamic range. Current assays for detecting genetic damage (eg gamma H2AX and Comet assays) are far less sensitive. DSBs can be caused by both endogenous processes, such as DNA replication and gene transcription, but also by induced events such as restriction enzyme digestion, or nuclease-dependent genome editing. We have shown that INDUCE-seq is capable of simultaneously detecting both rare endogenous breaks in the genome, as well as highly abundant targeted breaks over a vast dynamic range. In this application, we seek to train a student in the principles of 3Rs research with a view to training them to help build the future tools that will replace the current use of animals in genotoxicity testing of novel chemicals and compounds. This will enable the safe development of new materials in the future. We plan to further develop INDUCE-seq to test for the measurment of chemical induced DSBs, to provide additional genomic DNA damage data to add to the battery of genomic and proteomic analyses currently being developed in the drive to establish the necessary tools for next generation risk assessment (NGRA). The aim of such initiatives, which include the EPAs Toxcast programme and the related Tox21 consortium, is the successful introduction of NGRA, with a view to the eventual elimination of animal testing of chemicals.

We identified mutations in a novel gene, SLFN14, in patients with a dominantly inherited form of thrombocytopenia with enlarged platelets and reduced dense (δ) granules. The mechanism through which SLFN14 mutations cause thrombocytopenia and platelet function defects is unknown. We will investigate how mutations in SLFN14 regulate megakaryocyte development, maturation and signalling through the innovative use of human inducible pluripotent stem cells and CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) to create iPSC (inducible Pluripotent Stem Cell)-derived megakaryocytes bearing patient SLFN14 mutations. Subsequent RNA microarray, quantitative proteomics, microscopy and biochemical techniques will identify important proteins and pathways through which mutations in SLFN14 mediate thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction in patients. This study will provide novel insights into mechanisms underlying bleeding disorders, while also identifying pathways regulating platelet function that may be novel targets for the development of anti-thrombotic therapy.

We have identified dimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2) as a functional epigenetic mark implicated in regulating VSMC gene expression, including misregulation of matrix metalloproteinase family members. Here we will test the functional importance of the H3K9me2-pathway in vivo and in vitro. Firstly, loss of function assays will be combined with the novel powerful CRISPR/Cas9 technology to manipulate H3K9me2 levels locally at individual target genes. Secondly, a H3K9me2 inhibitor will be used in the carotid ligation model to assess the physiological effect on VSMC phenotypic switching in vivo. Finally, we will identify novel H3K9me2 targets to understand the mechanism by which the pathway operates. Collectively, this work will validate H3K9me2 as a regulator of VSMC plasticity and point towards possible nodes of intervention.	British Heart Foundation	Fellowship	117436.0	GBP
147	Dr. Qimron	TEL AVIV UNIVERSITY	None	2013-12-01	2018-12-01	Novel roles, components, and mechanisms of the Escherichia coli CRISPR/Cas system	A novel type of defense system was recently identified in bacteria: the CRISPR array and its associated gene products (Cas). The system inserts short DNA sequences, called spacers, derived from foreign nucleic acid molecules in between direct repeats, thus forming the CRISPR array. The transcribed spacers eventually serve as molecular guides for Cas proteins that monitor and destroy nucleic acids having sequences similar to those spacers. Thorough mapping of the functional components and regulators of the system in a single model organism will be extremely valuable for understanding its mechanism of action. Studying the interactions between bacteria and phages should highlight the evolutionary role of the system and its consequences for shaping ecological systems. These insights will lead to novel ways of exploiting the system to improve molecular biology tools, to protect fermenting bacteria from phage spoilage, to equip phages with anti-CRISPR warfare to fight bacteria, and to prevent horizontal gene transfer between pathogens. Here, I intend to systematically seek out new roles of the system and to identify fundamental mechanisms and components that allow the system to function efficiently. I will address fundamental questions such as how the system avoids sampling self DNA into the CRISPR array. In addition, I will pursue two revolutionary possibilities. One, that the CRISPR/Cas system is not merely an adaptive defense system against phages, but that one of its roles is to serve as molecular machinery for silencing specific harmful genes by generating small silencing RNAs without the need for Cas proteins. The other is to test the system's ability to prevent horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance genes in an effort to study the system's ecological value, potentially for applicative uses. My proposed studies will allow deeper understanding of the system, and enable breakthroughs from both basic and applicative aspects of the CRISPR field studies.

Significance: Many childhood cancers exhibit widespread epigenetic aberrations, including changes in DNA methylation and in histone marks. This is in stark contrast to their low frequency of genetic defects, and it suggests an important functional role for epigenome deregulation in these cancers. I have recently described massive changes in histone acetylation and genome-wide enhancer reprogramming for Ewing sarcoma, a difficult-to-treat pediatric tumor. In this project, I will investigate the hypothesis that Ewing sarcoma is an enhancer disease, characterized by highly orchestrated reprogramming of genome-wide histone acetylation patterns. This work will advance our understanding of Ewing sarcoma and of the epigenome’s role in pediatric cancers. It may also provide a molecular basis for pursuing epigenome editing and enhancer targeting and as new therapeutic strategies for Ewing sarcoma. Innovation: The proposed project focuses on a largely unexplored area of Ewing sarcoma research. Using the latest epigenome mapping technology, it will be possible to map and classify all enhancers that are driven by the oncogenic fusion protein EWS-FLI1. Furthermore, chromatin 3D mapping and bioinformatic analysis will connect the enhancers to their target genes genome-wide, and selected enhancer-gene links will be validated by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. I will also confirm the role of Ewing sarcoma specific enhancers in primary samples, using a cohort of 141 Ewing tumors for which I have already completed genome-wide DNA methylation sequencing. Approach: Aim 1. EWS-FLI1-driven enhancer landscape: Comprehensive mapping and integrative analysis of histone acetylation patterns and enhancer binding proteins in cells with tunable EWS-FLI1 expression Aim 2. Regulatory impact of EWS-FLI1-driven enhancers: Connecting Ewing sarcoma specific enhancers to their target genes via chromatin 3D structure mapping, CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, and enhancer RNA knockdown Aim 3. Enhancer activity in clinical samples: Correlating EWS-FLI1 driven enhancer activity to patient-specific gene expression profiles and clinical outcome in primary Ewing sarcoma tumors Environment: This project will be conducted in the laboratory of Prof. Heinrich Kovar at the St. Anna Children’s Cancer Research Institute (CCRI) in Vienna. The CCRI is Austria’s leading center for research on pediatric cancers and affiliated with the Medical University of Vienna. I will also collaborate with leading scientists in France (Olivier Delattre, Curie Institute), Austria (Christoph Bock & Keiryn Bennett, CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine) and the UK (Stephan Beck, University College London). Alignment with Funding Strategy: The proposed project addresses all goals of the Elise Richter Program: (i) it fosters career development of a qualified female scientist in Austria; (ii) the research program will establish the candidate’s scientific independence; (iii) the candidate provides a concrete career plan for becoming a principal investigator; (iv) the candidate pursues habilitation as the formal qualification for assistant professors in Austria.

Kinases are a group of enzymes that play a pivotal role in orchestrating the DNA-damage response, yet taken as a whole, the kinase family is largely understudied. To better understand the role of the human kinome in response to DNA damage we targeted the non-essential kinome (some 350 kinases in total) using CRISPR-Cas9 and subsequently screened these deficient cells against a panel of DNA damaging agents (16 in total), many of which are commonly used chemotherapeutics. This approach led to the identification of four novel interactions between kinases, frequently misregulated in cancer, (EPHB6, GSK3B, STYK16 and STYK1) and DNA damaging agents, used as chemotherapeutics. Now we aim to further investigate these novel interactions in a panel of cell lines, including patient-derived cell lines. Next we shall elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which loss of these kinases renders cells sensitive to DNA damaging inducing chemotherapeutics. Finally, we propose to prioritise and confirm our findings in a murine xenograft model for one of the identified interactions. Work resulting from this proposal may lead to the better treatment of patients with cancer due to mutations in the kinases EPHB6, GSK3B, STYK16 and STYK1.

Despite recent progress, adaptation is to date a poorly understood process largely due to limitations of current approaches that focus (i) on a priori candidate genes, (ii) on signals of selection at the DNA level without functional validation of the identified candidates, and (iii) on small sets of adaptive mutations that do not represent the variability present in natural populations. As a result, major questions such as what is the relative importance of different types of mutations in adaptation?, and what is the importance of epigenetic changes in adaptive evolution?, remain largely unanswered. To gain a deep understanding of adaptation, we need to systematically identify adaptive mutations across space and time, pinpoint their molecular mechanisms and discover their fitness effects. To this end, Drosophila melanogaster has proven to be an ideal organism. Besides the battery of genetic tools and resources available, D. melanogaster has recently adapted to live in out of Africa environments. We and others have already shown that transposable elements (TEs) have substantially contributed to the adaptation of D. melanogaster to different environmental challenges. Here, we propose to use state-of-the-art techniques, such as Illumina TruSeq sequencing and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, to systematically identify and characterize in detail adaptive TE insertions in D. melanogaster natural populations. Only by moving from gathering anecdotic evidence to applying global approaches, we will be able to start constructing a quantitative and predictive theory of adaptation that will be relevant for other species as well.

The project will be delivered in four workpackages (WP) over a three year period at UCL and UoC, with additional contributions from existing UKRMP hubs. 1. Methodologies to eliminate HLA, addressing 'missing self' and safety risks. CRISPR sgRNAs will be identified and validated for efficient HLA class I and II disruption and delivered using our hybrid lentiviral-CRISPR vector system. Transgenes encoding a replacement non-polymorphic HLA-G and/or a dimerising suicide gene will be coupled to CRISPR delivery, with Cas9 mRNA delivered transiently by electroporation. Alternative deamination base-editors will also be investigated to mitigate against the risk of translocation events in cells undergoing multiplexed editing. 2: Human pluripotent stem cell modification and differentiation Established HPSC lines (embryonic or induced) will be evaluated for their ability to support differentiation to hepatocytes or macrophages. Lines with optimal capacity will be selected for generation of universal hepatocytes (devoid of HLA lass I) or macrophages (devoid of HLA class I & II). In vitro sensitivity to anti-HLA antibodies will be examined, as well cellular responses mediated by healthy donor mismatched T and NK cells. 3: Characterization of genotoxicity risk Next generation sequencing will be used to quantify of on and off target activity. Sites of possible off target activity will be informed by Digenome analysis. Predicted translocations will be quantified by targeted qPCR and karyotypes assessed, including by FISH where possible. 4: Function and stealth of modified cell lines Persistence and immune-evasion of universal HSPC derived teratomas, macrophages and hepatocytes will be examined in humanised immunodeficient mice using healthy donor T and NK cells.

Muscle fibrosis, an associated feature of the disease, causes muscle dysfunction and contributes to the lethal DMD phenotype. This proposal seeks to examine whether upregulation of expression of relaxin can reduce/reverse the skeletal muscle fibrosis associated with DMD, since this peptide hormone of the insulin superfamily is a natural suppressor of age- and disease-related fibrosis in number of other tissues. Enhancement of gene expression is possible using a mutant non-catalytic dead Cas9 (dCas9) through its tethering to transcriptional activators [VP64-p65-Rta (VPR)]. This proposal seeks to explore the potential of CRISPR/Cas9 technology to transcriptionally upregulate expression of relaxin as an anti-fibrotic therapy for DMD using this SP-dCas9-VPR. Guide RNAs targeting upstream of the transcriptional start site of the Rln1 gene will be screened in Cas9-expressing HEK293T cells and the optimal guide RNA then used in conjunction with SP-dCas9-VPR in immortalised DMD patient cells. The effect of this treatment on the transcriptional of Rln1 and also a number of fibrotic genes will be examined using real-time RT-PCR.	Wellcome Trust	Vacation Scholarships	2000.0	GBP

Angiotensin II (AngII) activation-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage are primary events in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and failure. In our pilot study, we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate 2 novel mouse models with total and cardiac deletion of prolylcarboxypeptidase (PRCP), an AngII-degrading enzyme. We observed that the loss of PRCP worsened AngII-induced cardiac hypertrophy and oxidative stress in mitochondria. In this study, we aim to 1) investigate the function and signalling route whereby PRCP acts as a negative regulator of cardiac hypertrophy/heart failure through degrading AngII, 2) whether PRCP is a suitable target for the management of heart failure, focusing on its role in ameliorating oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage. To achieve the aims, we will use cutting- edge technologies including CRISPR/Cas9 technique, adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)- mediated gene delivery, recombinant peptide transduction and human induced pluripotent stem cells derived-cardiomyocytes (iPS-CMs). Molecular and translational evidence obtained from this study will provide new insights in developing efficient therapies for heart failure by means of enhancing PRCP action or the synergetic use of PRCP and other AngII blockers.

(Ms Tayyiba Azam)	Myocardial infarction (MI) by ischemic insult causes cardiomyocyte death and tissue destruction that lead to heart failure. Mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 7 (MKK7) is an important stress-activated kinase. We have previously shown that MKK7 is protective against pathological hypertrophy, which, like MI, results in cell death and heart failure. In the preliminary study, we observed that MKK7 cardiac-deleted (MKK7-CKO) mice were vulnerable to 1 week MI insult. In this PhD project, we will provide theoretical and technical training to the student to gain thorough understand of whether MKK7 is an important cardiac protector against MI through 3 objectives: 1) Assess MKK7 cardioprotective effects against MI in MKK7 cardiac overexpression (MKK7-Tg) mice. 2) Mechanistic study in adult rat cardiomyocytes (ARCMs) will be performed to investigate protective machinery through which MKK7 operates. 3) Human relevance of MKK7 function will be assessed using CRISPR/Cas9 mediated MKK7 knockout human embryonic stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (MKK7-KO-hESC-CMs), which have been generated in our lab. This project will advance our understanding of heart protective system during MI, and provide clues on whether MKK7 could be used therapeutically to reduce MI-induced injuries and adverse remodelling, therefore preventing heart failure development.

This modification is removed by a single enzyme, OGlcNAc hydrolase (OGA). Both proteins are essential for mammalian embryonic and perinatal survival, respectively. Recently, mutations in OGT have been identified as causal in intellectual disability (ID), however, the exact mechanism leading to this disorder are unknown. This studentship will endeavour to identify how two hypothesised mechanisms contribute to OGT-ID: altered O-GlcNAcylation and altered OGT:protein interactions. To achieve this the student will use Drosophila melanogaster as a model system. OGT is highly conserved from humans to Drosophila, along with many of its interactors, such as the mitochondrial motility protein Milton and periodicity proteins involved in the circadian rhythm. The student will dissect the molecular mechanisms leading to ID through achieving 4 aims. (1) The student will generate fly lines carrying OGT mutations equivalent to those found in patients using a CRISPR/Cas9 system. We have already demonstrated the viability of this approach successfully generating a fly line carrying a patient mutation. (2) These fly lines will then be assayed for a number of neuronal phenotypes, both morphological and behavioural. The former will be achieved using a combination of genetic and antibody labelling to visualize gross brain morphology, mushroom body morphology (the associative memory region of the fly brain, and an excellent model to study axonal morphology), and dendritic morphology using class IV dendritic arborisation sensory neurons. To assay neuronal function through behaviour, a light-off habituation test will be employed. This leverages the natural escape response of Drosophila to a sudden reduction in light, in nature signalling the presence of a predator, and measures their neuronal adaptation to the repetition of this stimulus without the ordinarily associated consequence. In preliminary experiments, we have found a decrease in habituation in OGT mutant flies. (3) The specific mechanisms driving the observed phenotypes will be dissected through proteomic and transcriptomic approaches. Quantitative O-GlcNAc proteomics will be conducted through enrichment of O-GlcNAcylated proteins with a catalytically inactive OGA we have used for this purpose in the past. The role of individual proteins or modified sites will be probed through genetic approaches, ablating induvial proteins to assess genetic interactions or individual modified sites by mutating modified residues to alanine. An additional approach which can be employed is the mutation of identified sites to cysteine. We have found this results in a SGlcNAc modification which is not hydrolysable by OGA, elevating the stoichiometry of the modification on a single residue. This is a technique which has never before been employed in vivo, and we would assay in the context of rescuing (some of) the phenotypes seen in OGT mutant flies. (4) The student will also attempt to rescue observed phenotypes by globally manipulating O-GlcNAc levels, genetically by knocking out OGA (which unlike in mammals is tolerated in the fly) and pharmacologically through the use of OGA inhibitors or glucosamine supplementation. All aforementioned approaches have been shown to result in elevated OGlcNAcylation. Their efficacy at rescuing phenotypes will be assayed through administration at various developmental stages providing insight into the reversibility of the ID in adult organisms. Together, this studentship will answer many fundamental questions about the role of OGT mutations in the development of ID, establish Drosophila as a model for the functional analysis of single site O-GlcNAc modifications, and guide future research we will conduct on a mammalian system.

To identify new therapeutic targets in AML, Dr Vassiliou's group recently performed CRISPR-Cas9 dropout screens and identified 492 AML-specific cell-essential genes, including several established anti-leukaemic drug targets and many novel therapeutic candidates. Going forward they will apply this technology to AML subtypes defined by particular somatic mutations. One subtype of AML is defined by TP53 gene mutations and is associated with an abysmal prognosis, with <10% survival. The aim of the proposed summer project will be to establish and validate TP53 knock-out (KO) clones generated from established TP53 wild-type (WT) AML cell lines using CRISPR-Cas9. These lines will then be used for comparative dropout screens to identify TP53-specific cell-essential genes, which could serve as therapeutic targets. For this, I will design and test different gRNAs for their effectiveness in knocking-out TP53. Cas9-expressing MOLM13 and MV4-11 cell lines will be transfected (separately) with lentiviruses carrying TP53-targeting or control gRNAs. Pooled cells will then be single-cell-sorted and clones assessed for TP53 knock-out efficiency using qRT-qPCR and western blotting. The best clones will then be used for downstream genome-wide screens.	Wellcome Trust	Vacation Scholarships	2000.0	GBP

The studentship will test whether this novel mechanism is also relevant for other cell types. This is important because clearance of dying cells is a fundamental process, but knowledge of the relevant signals and macrophage receptors is incomplete. Clearance is decided by the relative strengths of ‘eat me’ versus ‘don’t eat me’ signals, and data from the laboratory reveals an unexpected mechanism whereby mannose structures that are usually hidden, including some usually held inside RBC, become visible as ‘eat me’ signals to inspecting macrophages. Since dying RBC undergo a process called ‘eryptosis’, that is analogous to, but distinct from, apoptosis of nucleated cells, it is now necessary to test whether dying nucleated cells are also recognised by macrophages in the same way. The project will determine whether a variety of dying nucleated cell types display increased levels of mannose and whether their uptake by macrophages can be blocked by either competition from soluble sugars or by deletion of the macrophage mannose receptor by CRISPR.

Despite excellent survival post stem cell transplant, 30% of children have ongoing autoinflammation. Emerging evidence indicates that the actin cytoskeleton has an important role in autophagy, and inflammasome activity is intricately linked. Aims: Define the molecular role of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) in autophagy and inflammasome activation and investigate the impact of potential therapies. Methods: WASp knockout macrophage cell lines will be generated using CRISPR technology and GFP-tagged WASp introduced using lentiviral transduction. ATP, starvation and infection will be used to stimulate autophagy/ inflammasome activation. Cellular events will be followed by qPCR, western blotting and flow cytometry. Cellular localisation will be investigated by high resolution microscopy (epifluorescent, confocal, super resolution). Transcriptomics will be used to identify the impact of WASp deficiency on cellular gene expression. Implications: Inflammasome dysregulation has been implicated in a wide range of disease processes. Investigation of inflammasome dysfunction mechanisms in WAS will facilitate better understanding of the actin cytoskeleton role in the autophagy-inflammasome axis, providing therapeutic implications far beyond WAS.

Most aniridia cases are caused by heterozygous loss-of-function of PAX6 with rare cases having FOXC1 and PITX2 mutations. The FitzPatrick lab have identified multiple families with variants in MAB21L1, which completely phenocopy PAX6. A significant number of “PAX6-negative” aniridia patients remain unexplained in the Edinburgh Eye Malformations Cohort. We aim to answer the following questions: 1. Do variants at loci other than MAB21L1 phenocopy PAX6? 2. How do the gene products of aniridia-causing loci interact genetically and biochemically? Whole genome sequencing will be performed in PAX6-negative aniridia cases. The subsequent analysis will first focus on the PAX6 and MAB21L1 genes to identify previously undetected pathogenic genomic variants. If negative, genome wide analysis will be used to identify novel loci. In parallel, existing animal models will be crossed and phenotypically examined as single and double mutants to characterise the function and interaction of MAB21L1 and PAX6. Additionally, the availability of genome editing makes it possible create models for any new candidate genes. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated tagging of the endogenous MAB21L1 protein product will be attempted to enable immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence in ocular tissues.

ABPA is a progressive lung disease caused by the mayor fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. Although the disease is not usually fatal, the economic costs are >£10 billion in the UK per year. ABPA affects people with a defective airway epithelial function such as asthmatics. However, the percentage of patients developing ABPA is <2.5%. Genetic factors for the development of disease have not been defined so far. The Manchester Fungal Infection Group, has performed a whole exome sequencing project to investigate genetic variants in ABPA patients that might play a crucial role for the development of this disease. Some of these variants are involved in avoiding A.fumigatus to grow in the respiratory airways. However, functional validation of these at risk factors is need. Transgenic animal models have been used to study genetic predisposing factors in infectious diseases. However, non-animal models will contribute significantly for the replacement of animals in biological research. A cell culture model to study the pathology of ABPA using cells carrying the specific mutations discovered in our genetics project will improve our understanding of this disease and will supply enough information to select genes for the development of new diagnostic test. This training fellowship will define whether in vitro and ex vivo models can contribute to this aim by: (i) Recreating specific gene variants associated to ABPA in monocyte and bronchial epithelial cells by CRISPR/Cas9 system and testing their role in Aspergillus persistence and allergic response. (ii) Studying the interaction between epithelial cells and macrophages to define which cell subset and genetic risk factor orchestrates the ABPA-response.(iii) Validating candidate genetic variants in primary cells from patients with known genetic background.

Yet, the molecular mechanisms controlling the execution of symmetric versus asymmetric divisions in adult epithelia are still unfolding. We recently demonstrated that KIF5/kinesin-1 is essential for mammary epithelial cell divisions and cytoarchitecture by governing the trafficking of the spindle orientation and apical polarity components, respectively. Whether KIF5/kinesin-1 couples spindle orientation and polarity machineries during mitosis to promote ACDs; and whether other mechanisms are involved remain open questions. Here, we will address these questions in mammary 3D organoids. We will use CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to generate cells expressing AID-tagged endogenous KIF5/kinesin-1 to allow inducible and rapid degradation of the microtubule motor specifically during mitosis, for a precise evaluation of the role it plays in ACDs. We generated cells expressing GFP-tagged LGN –a key player in the spindle orientation machinery–to purify and analyse the LGN-containing complex by LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry and identify novel factors that participate to ACDs. These studies will elucidate the molecular mechanisms of ACDs in the mammary epithelia and provide rational for subsequent detailed investigations in vivo of their precise roles in development and homeostasis.

Tumour cells are surrounded by a fluid-mosaic membrane that contains tetraspanins (Tspans) which are evolutionary conserved proteins important in the formation of multiprotein complexes at the cell surface (‘tetraspanin web’). Increasing evidence indicates that Tspans are involved in cancer, still the architecture of the Tspan web in native tumour membranes and its (patho)physiological functions have not been resolved. Based on my preliminary data, I hypothesize that tumour cells contain a disrupted Tspan web in which Tspan interactions are modified leading to aberrant metabolic signalling and tumour development. This is supported by my discovery that loss of Tspan CD37 leads to spontaneous lymphomagenesis due to activation of the Akt survival pathway. The overall aim of Secret Surface is to unravel the composition, physiological functions and molecular mechanisms of the Tspan web on tumour development and clinical outcome. To achieve this, I will focus on studying lymphomas using a multidisciplinary approach: I. Detailed analyses of Tspan web composition in lymphoma to select clinically relevant Tspans (high-throughput tissue microarray technology, multispectral imaging). II. Resolve the endogenous Tspan web on lymphoma cells (super-resolution microscopy), and generation and analysis of lymphoma cells that have a complete deficiency of multiple Tspans (CRISPR/Cas9 technology). III. Decipher molecular mechanisms underlying Tspan web function in lymphoma cells (membrane organization, membrane-proximal signalling, metabolic reprogramming). With my unique toolbox of Tspan knock-outs coupled to advanced microscopy and metabolic studies, I expect that Secret Surface will lead to a new concept in cellular physiology in which cell surface organization by the Tspan web drives tumour development, which may open new horizons for the generation of new cancer therapies.

163	Professor Nigel Mongan	University of Nottingham	None	2017-03-01	2020-08-21	Novel therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of hormone refractory prostate cancer	Androgen Receptor (AR) is central to prostate cancer (PCa) tumorigenesis and metastases. While androgen deprivation therapies (ADT) impede tumor progression, hormone refractory PCa (HRPC) typically arises within ~18 months. HRPCs escape androgen dependency and are incurable. The AR regulates target genes by recruiting coregulators to promote transcription. The mechanisms involved in HRPC include AR mutations/splice variants and/or alterations in AR-coregulators. AR-coregulators, in particular &lsquo;druggable&rsquo; enzymes including lysine demethylases (KDMs), offer alternative targets to circumvent resistance to existing ADTs. KDM1A inhibitors have entered cancer clinical trials. For this reason our research seeks to validate, through proof of concept models, a subset of AR-coregulators as novel drug targets to inhibit androgen signaling in PCa. We recently found that AR regulation of the miR137 tumor suppressor in turn down-regulates expression of AR coregulators, including KDM1A and KDM7A, thereby attenuating androgen signaling. However this negative feedback pathway is compromised in PCa, thus enhancing AR-KDM activity. Moreover, we and others previously showed that increased KDM1A is associated with poorer PCa outcomes by promoting pro-metastatic pathways. We have new evidence identifying KDM7A as a novel AR coregulator involved in androgen signaling in PCa. Thus both KDM1A and KDM7A act to promote AR signaling. Our hypothesis is that AR, KDM1A and KDM7A cooperate to drive PCa progression. To test this hypothesis we will (1) confirm the clinical significance of KDM7A in localized and metastatic PCa specimens and (2) use CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing coupled with next generation RNAseq, supported by pharmacological approaches, to further investigate the functions of KDM1A and KDM7A in AR signaling. Our objectives will establish the pre-clinical evidence for using drugs targeting KDM function in PCa. Similar epigenetic-targeting drugs are already in use and in clinical trials for other cancers and may offer more selective and better tolerated treatments than existing therapies for advanced PCa.

Hehl	University of Zurich	Institut für Parasitologie Vetsuisse-Fakultät Universität Zürich	2015-10-01	2018-09-30	Cyst wall formation: a persistent challenge in Toxoplasmosis	The acute phase of Toxoplasma gondii infection initiates with the rapid proliferation and dissemination of the fast-replicating form of the parasite (tachyzoite) throughout the vertebrate host. At the onset of the immune response, the tachyzoites are efficiently neutralized and the infection enters in a chronic phase with conversion to a slow-replicating developmental stage (bradyzoite) that forms tissue cysts predominantly in the central nervous system and in striated and heart muscle. This process of encystation is vital to the parasite’s life cycle because i) it ensures survival and life-long persistence in intermediate hosts, and ii) it allows peroral transmission to the feline definitive host, initiating the sexual cycle. Tissue cysts not only prevent eradication of the parasite, but also pose a significant threat of reactivation in the context of host immunosuppression and can lead to encephalitis and other severe clinical manifestations.Despite the central importance of cyst formation for pathogenesis and transmission, our insight into how T. gondii defies the innate and adaptive immune responses to take up permanent residence in the immunocompetent hosts is rudimentary. Very little is known about the cyst wall composition and the molecular processes governing its formation. We have a very fragmented view of the temporal and spatial dissemination of cysts in the host and especially in the brain. Progress in biology is driven both by medical necessity and scientific curiosity and this project, which proposes to investigate the process of encystation, lies at the intersection of these two forces. It is the most propitious time to address the challenging question of cyst wall formation in light of the most recent breakthroughs in the sensitivity of -omics approaches, the power of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in genome editing, the revolution in high-throughput microscopy, and ex-vivo tissue examination at the highest level of resolution.This ambitious and highly synergistic project tackles key biological questions on tissue cyst formation and capitalizes heavily on cutting-edge technologies to address three specific objectives:1. A comprehensive definition of the cyst wall composition. We will generate an unprecedentedly accurate transcriptome of the bradyzoite stage and a differential proteome of bradyzoites and the surrounding cyst wall. The data will be curated via a powerful comparative genomics approach spanning cyst-forming and cyst-lacking Apicomplexa species. A complementary mutagenesis and selection strategy is designed to identify specific defects in cyst formation or maturation by large-scale genetic screens using quantitative high-throughput microscopy.2. An uncovering of molecular mechanisms governing the cyst wall formation. This aim will be accomplished by taking a targeted as well as a global functional approach. Starting from recent findings on parasitophorous vacuole formation of tachyzoites we will implement a semi-targeted gene knockout- or conditional knockout approach. Moreover, the creation of a comprehensive gene disruption collection in subproject 1 will allow identification of all non-essential tachyzoites genes that display trafficking defects during cyst formation. Key mutants will be mechanistically dissected in vitro with a subset to be investigated further in vivo. 3. A spatiotemporal cartography of cyst formation in the brain. We will harness cutting-edge imaging methods to investigate the in vivo dynamics of dissemination and cyst formation in the whole body and foremost in the brain of a mouse infection model. These findings will inform development of spatiotemporal models describing parasite dissemination and differentiation, to be correlated with data from post-mortem biopsies. By combining unbiased and targeted experimental approaches, we are poised to achieve major conceptual advances in deciphering the molecular events leading to cyst wall formation. In the long term, the data and technology created in this project will lay the foundation to decoding the molecular information exchange between host and pathogen during establishment of life-long latent infections. These studies fill a significant knowledge gap and will provide i) highly valuable web-accessible integrated gene expression data, ii) fundamental discoveries about the regulatory and trafficking circuits that govern formation of the cyst wall as a biological barrier during encystation iii) invaluable paradigms of how the parasite initiates and sustains molecular programs required for disease progression and persistence.

Over the course of evolution, eukaryotes have acquired mitochondria to perform efficient energy conversion from food and oxygen into ATP, a process called oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Mitochondrial OXPHOS and cytosolic glycolysis are the two major pathways for generating cellular ATP and cells are exquisitely tuned to dynamically match nutrient fuel sources and energy demands. Much of our understanding of mitochondrial and metabolic rewiring in response to fuel sources has been elucidated using yeast as a model system. However we currently lack a systems biology view of this process in humans. Elucidating these fundamental cellular pathways is crucial for understanding and treating mitochondrial dysfunction, which underlies human diseases ranging from neonatal lethality to type II diabetes, cancer and neurodegeneration.In exciting preliminary studies, I have harnessed the ability of human K562 cells to quickly rewire metabolism from glycolysis to mitochondrial OXPHOS when glucose is replaced by galactose in the media. Here, I propose to leverage our lab’s deep expertise in genomics and systems biology to decipher mechanisms underlying the mitochondrial “activation” and “deactivation” in response to changes in sugar availability. Specifically, I will (1) identify the markers of mitochondrial activation by systematic RNA, protein and metabolite profiling during nutrient shifting, (2) identify genetic drivers of mitochondrial activation using genome-wide CRISPR and ORF screening and (3) integrate these results to decipher molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial activation. These findings are likely to help our understanding of cellular metabolism as well as mitochondrial function and pathologies.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Advanced Postdoc.Mobility	None	None

In principle, it allows for the DNA within a cell to be changed. With the dawn of new gene editing technologies such as CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 9), repairing mutations within human cells has become reality. Our ability to program this bacterial defense mechanism with human target sequences has unlocked unprecedented possibilities for gene therapy and personalized medicine.While deleting a gene to impair its function within a cell is presently fairly easy, the reversion of a detrimental mutation back to its non-disease state is much more difficult. This requires exchange of one sequence by another, which is only entirely precise when mediated by a process called homologous recombination or homology directed repair (HDR). While CRISPR-Cas9 has made gene editing by homologous recombination easier, its efficiency remains poor. This is a major limitation that must be overcome if genome editing technologies are to be used in medical treatments or commercial applications in biotechnology. The majority of research that focuses on improving CRISPR-Cas9 has tried to modify the components of the bacterial Cas9 system. Our approach, however, addresses this problem from a completely different perspective. We have shown that one can greatly increase repair by homologous recombination by making the cell’s genome more accessible to the editing machinery. Simply put, reverting a mutation by gene editing is like trying to cut a metal wire with a pair of office scissors; this still works but is very inefficient. Instead, our method changes the metal wire into a piece of string, allowing the scissors to cut easily. The underlying evidence for this project stems from our research in budding yeast, where we showed that making DNA more accessible enhances the rate of genome integrations 4-fold. If true in mammalian cells, this research could become a fundamental aspect of genome editing, applicable not only to CRISPR-Cas9 but also to any gene editing technologies yet to come.With the support of the Bridge funding for a Proof of Concept, I will expand our previous work from yeast to human cells. I plan to develop compounds that can be used to transiently lower histone levels in human cell culture. My ultimate goal is to increase the accessibility of DNA in the context of gene editing to enhance CRISPR-Cas9 editing efficiencies in somatic cells. I aim to establish the data necessary to bridge from basic research to a tool that will enable the use of gene editing for biotech or medical applications.

In such cases, prognosis have not improved over the last dec-ades and outcome is still unacceptably low. Only a limited number of studies directly address this prob-lem, mainly because in vivo model systems to mimic recurrences and identify novel drug sensitivities are lacking. One additional problem specific to pediatric malignancies is the paucity of actionable mutations that can be identified both from diagnostic as well as relapse samples. Hence, existing recurrent genetic abnormalities such as translocation events gain additional weight and we can hypothesize that other mechanisms such as epigenetic transcriptional control might play a major role in disease development. To specifically address these topics, we suggest in this proposal to take advantage of our novel insights that have recently been obtained during the current funding period. We are also proud that we are now part of a very large European initiative which will allow us to substantially expand our collection of pa-tient-derived xenografts and which will be used in most of the proposed projects. To gain novel insights into development and treatment of recurrent disease, we will address the following specific aims: Aim 1: To establish a personalized drug screening platform and identify novel treatment vulnerabilities directly in patient derived primary cell cultures. We hypothesize that new sequencing efforts of recurrent samples have to be supplemented with functional drug screens to advance treatment of relapsed patients. In addition, our platform serves as discovery tool to identify novel mechanisms of drug resistances and novel biomarkers for patient selection.Aim 2: To further validate CHD4 as major drug target in pediatric malignancies and describe the epi-genetic landscape of fusion positive-RMS tumors in general. We hypothesize that CHD4, a newly iden-tified crucial co-factor of the RMS specific fusion protein PAX3-FOXO1, has a more widespread function as epigenetic reader than previously appreciated. In addition, we will use unbiased large scale screens to identify novel epigenetic vulnerabilities in RMS tumors.Aim 3: To identify novel (chemo)resistance mechanisms directly in patient derived tumor material and develop novel rational combinatorial treatment strategies. Using both unbiased in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 drop-out screens and a hypothesis driven approach investigating the contribution of hedgehog signaling, and by comparing diagnostic versus relapse samples from the same patients, we will identify resistance mechanisms that will guide combinatorial drug development, aiming at re-sensitizing tumors that are resistant to commonly applies chemotherapeutics. We expect that this follow-up proposal will provide relevant novel insights into RMS biology and pro-gression by working directly with patient material and will contribute novel pre-clinical information to guide development of targeted therapies into early phase I/II clinical protocols.

I have recently optimised ex vivo pancreatic organoids as an efficient and tractable system to study the effect of perturbations on ductal cell fate. I now propose to use organoids to characterise the cell types coexisting in the ductal compartment that are permissive or non-permissive for changing cell fate change, and the molecular pathways involved. Differentiation will be induced by Ngn3/Pdx1/MafA overexpression or by medium containing differentiation inducing factors. My goals are as follows: 1) Use transcriptomics to delineate different cell types in ductal INS-GFP organoids to identify markers of reprogramming-competent cells; 2) Compare RNASeq profiles of reprogrammed, intermediate, and unchanged organoid cells to reveal genes required for cell fate change; and 3) Perform a Crispr/Cas9-based loss of function screen to identify the crucial signaling pathways involved in duct cell fate maintenance, using CK19-Cherry as a marker of ductal cell fate. These results will elucidate the fundamental biology of pancreatic ductal cell plasticity and provide clues for how to unlock the regenerative capacity of pancreatic ductal cells in vivo for future therapies.

A plethora of functions have been attributed to these proteases such as killing pathogens, inactivating toxins, inducing death of infected or cancer cells, modulating cytokine activity and remodeling extracellular matrix proteins. Much progress has been made in the last decade in understanding the functions of intracellular serpins which inhibit granule proteases of immune cells. Importantly, we have established that Serpinb1 is an essential survival factor of neutrophils (PMNs) through the inhibition of their own granule protease CatG. CatG triggers a form of programmed cell death that has features of apoptosis through activation of caspases and of regulated necrosis with rapid loss of plasma membrane integrity and release of inflammatory mediators. Although we have made significant advances, the exact molecular mechanisms leading to cell death and inflammation in the absence of intracellular serpins remain to be identified. In this project, we will use a combination of targeted (hypothesis-driven) and untargeted (degradomics and phenotype screening) methods to address the knowledge gaps in the mechanisms of CatG-mediated cell death and in the functions of Serpinb1, Serpinb6 and Serpinb9 in vivo. In particular, we have taken the high risk, high reward approach of mouse genetics and developed unique models to directly address these important questions. The proposed project will address the following two aims: Our first specific aim is to identify the mechanisms of cell death mediated by cathepsin G in myeloid cells. We will focus on the biology of myeloid cells and further explore specific cell death pathways associated with PMN and monocyte PCD in vitro. We will use a comparative proteomic approach to identify the CatG-specific degradome in PMNs associated with cell death. The identified targets will be validated by genetic targeting, including CRISPR and Cas9 designer nuclease technology. The second specific aim is to investigate the global and individual functions of the 14 functional serpins encoded in the expanded mouse SerpinB6-SerpinB9-SerpinB1 gene cluster on mouse chromosome 13, for which we generated a complete, yet viable knock-out. We will investigate specific defects of innate and adaptive immune cell development, homeostasis in steady state and inflammatory conditions. We will particularly investigate the cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous functions of invariant NKT cell subsets, which appear to be negatively regulated by SerpinB1 and, potentially, also by other intracellular serpins of this cluster. Finally, we will perform a standardized, comprehensive phenotypic screening of mice lacking all clade B serpin genes on mouse chromosome 13. This explorative analysis will be followed by a second stage testing where identified defects will be functionally investigated for individual serpin genes and their known target proteases. Overall, this multipronged project based on animal genetics will identify and functionally validate novel proteolytic targets associated with programmed cell death and will reveal important pathophysiological mechanisms mediated by granule proteases of immune cells and their inhibitors, which will likely have implications for developmental, inflammatory, infectious and proliferative diseases.

What molecular programs specify the LPM within the embryonic mesoderm and subsequently pattern it into the bilateral stripes that differentiate into its descendant cell fates remain unknown. The goals of my proposed projects is to chart previously elusive cell fates of the LPM and to uncover the molecular regulation of LPM formation using the zebrafish (Danio rerio) as principal model. Understanding LPM formation and patterning will provide a developmental framework of how key features of the vertebrate body plan evolved. Further, an improved mechanistic grasp of LPM formation will provide a concept to understand the genetic causes of congenital cardiovascular disorders.The zebrafish embryo provides a unique model to tackle LPM formation with its rapid development, optical translucency, and potent genetic toolbox. In our previous and ongoing work, we have uncovered several cis-regulatory elements that are specifically active in the emerging LPM in different vertebrate species. Our experiments allow us to track the forming LPM in unprecedented detail, have revealed an ancient, evolutionarily conserved program that drives LPM formation, and enabled us to add additional cell fates of LPM descent. We have further maximized mutagenesis with CRISPR-Cas9 to rapidly probe the developmental contribution of genes and cis-regulatory elements accompanied by state-of-the-art sequence analysis.Here, we will combine live lightsheet microscopy (SPIM) of unique LPM reporter strains, genetic lineage tracing, chromatin analysis, and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutagenesis to investigate the regulation of LPM emergence and cell migration. In Aim 1, we will address open questions concerning the LPM’s cell fate architecture. In Aim 1A, we will combine latest transgenic zebrafish techniques to investigate the controversial origins of individual endothelial lineages during body plan formation. In Aim 1B, we will pursue the identity of individual LPM stripes, which have received conflicting definitions in the past.For Aim 2, we will chart and functionally investigate the regulatory landscape of emerging LPM territory and will probe the regulation of its dynamic cell migration. In Aim 2A, we will chart the regulatory landscape of the emerging LPM with chromatin analysis and will establish the developmental contribution of individual cis-regulatory elements as basis for targeting putative enhancers in vivo using our new CRISPR-Cas9 tools. We will complement this approach in Aim 2B with somatic CRISPR-Cas9-based mutagenesis of migration- and adhesion-controlling candidate genes to elucidate how the spatio-temporal migration pattern in the LPM is coordinated. Altogether, our aims will elucidate fundamental open questions in vertebrate development, and will establish a new paradigm for discovering and functionally validating cis-regulatory elements and molecular regulators in vivo.

In eukaryotes, the cytosolic Hsp90 is essential, undoubtedly because of its central role in the proteostasis system. With the help of a large cohort of cofactors (co-chaperones), it associates with a substantial portion of all proteins, and constitutes a major hub of the proteome. Hsp90 clients include many regulatory and signaling proteins that depend on it to stabilize thermodynamically metastable states. The mitochondrial Hsp90 isoform Trap1, a simplified version of an Hsp90 machine, regulates cellular energy metabolism. Despite a recent explosion of the Hsp90/Trap1 literature, their in vivo functions in normal and cancer cells remain poorly understood. We propose to fill some of these knowledge gaps with a multi-pronged approach.Specific goals:•Genetic dissection of the Hsp90 machine in the mouse: Understand the global physiological and pathological functions of this molecular chaperone machine in a complex model organism. For the core components Hsp90 and Hsp90, and for the co-chaperones Aha1, Aha2, and Aarsd1, we will study the phenotypes of constitutive or conditional gene deletions at a global level and for selected tissues, and try to link phenotype with genotype mechanistically.•Functional interactions at the cellular level: Elucidate the essential functional interactions of this major molecular chaperone machine and proteome hub by genome-wide synthetic lethal and chemogenomic screens with mammalian cell lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. These screens for essential interacting genes will be done with cells lacking Hsp90, Hsp90, or the co-chaperone Stip1/Hop, or treated with an Hsp90 inhibitor or exposed to other proteostasis perturbations.•Hsp90 and cancer: Discover why cancer cells are more Hsp90-dependent and hypersensitive to Hsp90 inhibitors. A key tool for the analysis of the role of individual factors and pathways will be an isogenic pair of normal and Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells. •Synthetic chaperone: Strip Hsp90 down to the bare essentials by reconstructing it into a synthetic chaperone. Identify the absolutely essential core functions and the significance of Hsp90 heterodimers.•Live cell imaging of Hsp90 interactions: Develop luminescence resonance energy transfer with lanthanide ions as a powerful tool to do 'real-time in vivo biochemistry' of the Hsp90 machine.•Mitochondrial Hsp90 isoform Trap1: Understand how Trap1 regulates cellular energy metabolism and how this affects physiological cellular processes such as the regulation of cell size and cell migration, and, as a long-term goal, pathological events such as cancer and other diseases.

172	Dr Marcin Przewloka	University of Southampton	None	2018-12-01	2020-12-01	Novel Role of a Protein Phosphatase in Chromosome Segregation	Kinases and their antagonistic phosphatases both provide a key regulatory mechanism controlling many cellular events. Yet our molecular understanding of phosphatases lags behind. Recently we described an interaction between Protein Phosphatase 4 (PP4) and Drosophila centromeres, which when disrupted affects the mitotic centromere integrity and spindle assembly checkpoint activity. The details of this pathway remain to be elucidated. Nor is it known how this finding relates to PP4's de-regulation in many cancers. I will therefore turn to human cell line model to address these questions. Towards determining human PP4’s mitotic functions, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing will be used to generate cell lines expressing endogenous PP4 fused with the AID tag allowing for inducible and rapid degradation of the phosphatase. This approach will facilitate PP4 removal specifically in mitotic cells, the effects of which will be characterised by cell imaging. Parallel studies, including proteomics, will deliver precise information on the human PP4 interaction network and behaviour during mitosis. Together these data will reveal the affected processes and provide a "blueprint" for subsequent detailed investigations that identify the involved pathways, PP4-specific substrates and their phospho-regulatory sites. The results of this study will be later placed within a larger investigatory framework dissecting chromosome segregation.	Wellcome Trust	Seed Award in Science	100000.0	GBP

Hypoxia (low oxygen) is found in >50% of breast tumours, and is more frequently found in the more aggressive triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype which is associated with worse patient survival. Hypoxia drives TNBC progression, promoting adaptation through genes regulating the major hallmarks of cancer. Clinically, hypoxia is associated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance and worse patient survival. Identifying ways to target hypoxic tumours is a key objective to improve therapeutic response. Hypoxia drives molecular adaptation through the HIF1α and HIF2α transcription factors. Attempts to target HIF directly have had limited success, however we showed that JQ1 an inhibitor of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins (BRD2-4 and BRDT), which are histone acetylation “readers”, reduced the expression of 44% of hypoxia-induced genes in TNBC, and reduced tumour growth in vivo . Aims We aim to understand which BET proteins regulate hypoxic molecular adaptation. We propose that targeting an individual BET protein will yield greater anti-hypoxic tumour effects. We will examine the requirement for individual BET proteins for survival and growth in the hypoxic microenvironment in vitro and in vivo . Finally we will analyse genome wide BET protein DNA binding and histone acetylation in hypoxia. Techniques and Methodology This project will use biochemical studies and CRISPR CAS9 genome editing and ChIP-Seq to determine which BET proteins are essential for HIF-mediated hypoxic adaptation, interrogating mechanistic aspects of hypoxic gene expression, growth and survival in hypoxia. We will evaluate the impact of an individual BET protein knockdown in a xenograft model using in vivo imaging. Impact on breast cancer research This work will provide a greater comprehension of hypoxic TNBC gene expression regulation and proof of concept data to accelerate the development of BET inhibitors as new leads for TNBC.

Most of the apple cultivars produced today are susceptible to devastating diseases such as apple scab and fire blight. Therefore, the production of fruits attaining commercial quality requires excessive pesticide input. Breeding for resistant cultivars is the most economically and environmentally sustainable approach to reduce the chemical footprint of apple production. However, the selection of novel cultivars through classical apple breeding is a long process, hampered by the long juvenility phase and self-incompatibility of this species. Methods to obtain novel traits and improve disease resistance without undergoing several long-lasting breeding cycles are therefore of great interest.Genetic engineering has been proposed as an effective way to improve apple cultivars but the resulting genetically modified organisms currently lack public acceptance. Here, we propose to implement a non-transgenic system to obtain novel traits in apple, using the most prominent genome editing tool CRISPR/Cas9. This will be achieved by transfection of apple protoplasts with preassembled Cas9/gRNA ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) which avoids the need of integration of a Cas9 expressing transgene in the target plant. Specifically, we will establish the plant material and protocols for protoplasts production in the first two tasks. Task three aims at the establishment of an effective apple protoplasts regeneration protocol. In task four, protoplasts transfection with preassembled RNPs will be optimized using a widely applied selectable marker system (GFP; green fluorescent protein / BFP; blue fluorescent protein-conversion). These optimized protocols will be used in task five to generate the first mildew-resistant apple cultivar by an MdMLO19 knockout. In the sixth (high risk - high impact) task, the established genome editing system will be tested for its feasibility to replace large DNA sequences by homology-directed double strands breaks repair.This project will develop a transformation-free genome editing system in apple and generate improved germplasm in one of the most important fruits worldwide. On the long run, the methods and protocols established here will enable allele replacement strategies at known disease resistance genes to significantly reduce pesticide input in apple production.

Our group has shown that CDX2 protein is absent or markedly reduced in up to 20% of colorectal cancers, which correlates with de-differentiation, metastatic spread and unfavorable patient outcome. Our preliminary data using a panel of colorectal cancer cell lines confirms that promoter hypermethylation is a likely cause of CDX2 expression loss, since CDX2 expression can be recovered upon treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi). Here, we aim to show that epigenetic modifications leading to CDX2 loss are clinically and functionally relevant and that these effects can be reversed by epigenetic therapies. Since these therapies have ‘global’ effects on demethylation, we aim to overcome the methylation blockade of CDX2, by establishing a state-of the-art method for specific targeting of the CDX2 promoter for re-activation. To achieve these aims, we will first determine whether CDX2 promoter hypermethylation causes CDX2 protein loss in human colorectal cancers and we will assess the relationship of CDX2 with the general methylator phenotype. Second, we take advantage of a fully-characterized cohort of colorectal cancer patients (n=750) to determine the potential prognostic and predictive relevance of CDX2 hypermethylation and protein loss. Third, we will identify novel transcriptional regulators of CDX2 based on transcription binding site prediction (e.g. GATA family members and p300) by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and validate results using other promoter assays. The function of these transcription factors in colorectal cancer cell lines after knock-down will be assessed. Our findings will be validated using fresh frozen material from our high-quality biobank. Fourth, we will determine the effects of DNMTis and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) on methylated and unmethylated cell lines in vitro and CDX2 expression. Chromatin structure will be investigated by analysing open and repressed histone marks and their effect on CDX2 restoration. To re-activate silenced CDX2 promoters we propose to use CRISPR technology to target either a transcriptional activation domain or the catalytic domain of the demethylating TET2 protein to the human CDX2 promoter. Small guide (sg) RNAs will be designed and tested to target nuclease inactive Cas9 fused to either VPS64, a transcriptional activator, or to the catalytic domain of TET2, a demethylating enzyme to the CDX2 promoter region. To further increase the chance of successful re-activation of the CDX2 promoter, we take advantage of an amplifier system based on a polypeptide scaffold (Sun Tag) fused to the inactive Cas9 protein. The Sun Tag will be able to recruit multiple VPS64 or TET2 proteins, fused to single chain variable fragment specific for the Sun polypeptide, to the CDX2 promoter region. We will establish CDX2 knockdown colon cancer cell lines and compare expression of CDX2 in methylated, unmethylated and genomically modified cell lines, then perform functional assays to determine effects on proliferation, migration and invasion. This will allow us to determine whether CDX2 expression and its function can be reversed upon modification. This proposal uses the latest genome editing technologies to uncover new aspects of CDX2 in colorectal cancers. Not only will the clinical and biological relevance of this gene be detailed, but new regulatory aspects of CDX2 will be highlighted. Additionally, successful targeted re-activation of an already-methylated promoter, as we are proposing to do in the project, may be further generalized to other important tumor suppressor genes and could have significant therapeutic potential.

Parkinson's disease (PD), PD dementia (PDD) and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are Lewy body (LB) diseases, which are characterised by the cytoplasmic accumulation of a-synuclein in neurons, forming Lewy bodies (LBs). At present we do not know what molecular changes may be driving disease onset and progression and there are currently no disease-modifying treatments for these diseases. This study will represent the first systematic, epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of DNA methylation across multiple diseases characterised by synucleinopathy. We propose to analyse DNA methylation patterns using the Illumina EPIC array in 100 PD, 100 PDD, 100 DLB and 100 control donors in the substantia nigra (SN) as this is affected in the middle stages of disease, and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) as this is affected in the later stages of disease. We will identify DNA methylation signatures that can stratify individuals based on their diagnosis, genotype, pathology, symptoms and, in the case of PD, the presence of PDD. We will validate these patterns, and determine their cellular specificity using pyrosequencing and qRT-PCR on nucleic acid extracted from neurons and glia isolated from SN and PFC samples using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Loci that appear to be neuronal we will investigate further using laser capture microdissection (LCM) in PFC samples. We will collect LB-bearing neurons and neurons free of pathology and use pyrosequencing to determine which loci are specifically altered in LB-bearing neurons. These loci will be the focus of our functional characterisation experiments, where we propose to use CRISPR/Cas9 technology to alter DNA methylation at these loci, and establish the downstream consequence on cell phenotype. Taken together, we will be able to identify differentially methylated loci that are causal in LB disease pathology, which could ultimately deliver new pharmacological targets, potentially improving the lives of sufferers.

However, while it has been shown that the genetic background of the donor individual has an effect on molecular phenotypes measured from iPSCs, it is currently not known how much the genetic background influences studies that use iPSCs to model rare disease mutations, making interpretation of results challenging. In this project, I will use CRISPR-Cas9 technology to study specific rare disease mutations in different genetic backgrounds. Specifically, I will focus on loss-of-function mutations causing Kabuki syndrome, a disorder of the epigenetic machinery, and use patient-derived iPSCs together with engineered mutant and control lines to quantify the contribution of the genetic background on the transcriptome and epigenome of the iPSCs as well as neuronal precursor cells derived from them. This project will establish the value of using patient-derived iPSCs over generic iPSC lines with engineered mutations. This information is critical for the design of any subsequent studies in which iPSCs serve as the baseline, such as directed differentiation experiments and therapeutic targeting of the mutation.

Yet, the molecular mechanisms controlling the execution of symmetric versus asymmetric divisions in adult epithelia are still unfolding. We recently demonstrated that KIF5/kinesin-1 is essential for mammary epithelial cell divisions and cytoarchitecture by governing the trafficking of the spindle orientation and apical polarity components, respectively. Whether KIF5/kinesin-1 couples spindle orientation and polarity machineries during mitosis to promote ACDs; and whether other mechanisms are involved remain open questions. Here, we will address these questions in mammary 3D organoids. We will use CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to generate cells expressing AID-tagged endogenous KIF5/kinesin-1 to allow inducible and rapid degradation of the microtubule motor specifically during mitosis, for a precise evaluation of the role it plays in ACDs. We generated cells expressing GFP-tagged LGN –a key player in the spindle orientation machinery–to purify and analyse the LGN-containing complex by LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry and identify novel factors that participate to ACDs. These studies will elucidate the molecular mechanisms of ACDs in the mammary epithelia and provide rational for subsequent detailed investigations in vivo of their precise roles in development and homeostasis.

Tumour cells are surrounded by a fluid-mosaic membrane that contains tetraspanins (Tspans) which are evolutionary conserved proteins important in the formation of multiprotein complexes at the cell surface (‘tetraspanin web’). Increasing evidence indicates that Tspans are involved in cancer, still the architecture of the Tspan web in native tumour membranes and its (patho)physiological functions have not been resolved. Based on my preliminary data, I hypothesize that tumour cells contain a disrupted Tspan web in which Tspan interactions are modified leading to aberrant metabolic signalling and tumour development. This is supported by my discovery that loss of Tspan CD37 leads to spontaneous lymphomagenesis due to activation of the Akt survival pathway. The overall aim of Secret Surface is to unravel the composition, physiological functions and molecular mechanisms of the Tspan web on tumour development and clinical outcome. To achieve this, I will focus on studying lymphomas using a multidisciplinary approach: I. Detailed analyses of Tspan web composition in lymphoma to select clinically relevant Tspans (high-throughput tissue microarray technology, multispectral imaging). II. Resolve the endogenous Tspan web on lymphoma cells (super-resolution microscopy), and generation and analysis of lymphoma cells that have a complete deficiency of multiple Tspans (CRISPR/Cas9 technology). III. Decipher molecular mechanisms underlying Tspan web function in lymphoma cells (membrane organization, membrane-proximal signalling, metabolic reprogramming). With my unique toolbox of Tspan knock-outs coupled to advanced microscopy and metabolic studies, I expect that Secret Surface will lead to a new concept in cellular physiology in which cell surface organization by the Tspan web drives tumour development, which may open new horizons for the generation of new cancer therapies.

180	Professor Nigel Mongan	University of Nottingham	None	2017-03-01	2020-08-21	Novel therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of hormone refractory prostate cancer	Androgen Receptor (AR) is central to prostate cancer (PCa) tumorigenesis and metastases. While androgen deprivation therapies (ADT) impede tumor progression, hormone refractory PCa (HRPC) typically arises within ~18 months. HRPCs escape androgen dependency and are incurable. The AR regulates target genes by recruiting coregulators to promote transcription. The mechanisms involved in HRPC include AR mutations/splice variants and/or alterations in AR-coregulators. AR-coregulators, in particular &lsquo;druggable&rsquo; enzymes including lysine demethylases (KDMs), offer alternative targets to circumvent resistance to existing ADTs. KDM1A inhibitors have entered cancer clinical trials. For this reason our research seeks to validate, through proof of concept models, a subset of AR-coregulators as novel drug targets to inhibit androgen signaling in PCa. We recently found that AR regulation of the miR137 tumor suppressor in turn down-regulates expression of AR coregulators, including KDM1A and KDM7A, thereby attenuating androgen signaling. However this negative feedback pathway is compromised in PCa, thus enhancing AR-KDM activity. Moreover, we and others previously showed that increased KDM1A is associated with poorer PCa outcomes by promoting pro-metastatic pathways. We have new evidence identifying KDM7A as a novel AR coregulator involved in androgen signaling in PCa. Thus both KDM1A and KDM7A act to promote AR signaling. Our hypothesis is that AR, KDM1A and KDM7A cooperate to drive PCa progression. To test this hypothesis we will (1) confirm the clinical significance of KDM7A in localized and metastatic PCa specimens and (2) use CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing coupled with next generation RNAseq, supported by pharmacological approaches, to further investigate the functions of KDM1A and KDM7A in AR signaling. Our objectives will establish the pre-clinical evidence for using drugs targeting KDM function in PCa. Similar epigenetic-targeting drugs are already in use and in clinical trials for other cancers and may offer more selective and better tolerated treatments than existing therapies for advanced PCa.

181	Adrian B. Hehl	University of Zurich	Institut für Parasitologie Vetsuisse-Fakultät Universität Zürich	2015-10-01	2018-09-30	Cyst wall formation: a persistent challenge in Toxoplasmosis	The acute phase of Toxoplasma gondii infection initiates with the rapid proliferation and dissemination of the fast-replicating form of the parasite (tachyzoite) throughout the vertebrate host. At the onset of the immune response, the tachyzoites are efficiently neutralized and the infection enters in a chronic phase with conversion to a slow-replicating developmental stage (bradyzoite) that forms tissue cysts predominantly in the central nervous system and in striated and heart muscle. This process of encystation is vital to the parasite’s life cycle because i) it ensures survival and life-long persistence in intermediate hosts, and ii) it allows peroral transmission to the feline definitive host, initiating the sexual cycle. Tissue cysts not only prevent eradication of the parasite, but also pose a significant threat of reactivation in the context of host immunosuppression and can lead to encephalitis and other severe clinical manifestations.Despite the central importance of cyst formation for pathogenesis and transmission, our insight into how T. gondii defies the innate and adaptive immune responses to take up permanent residence in the immunocompetent hosts is rudimentary. Very little is known about the cyst wall composition and the molecular processes governing its formation. We have a very fragmented view of the temporal and spatial dissemination of cysts in the host and especially in the brain. Progress in biology is driven both by medical necessity and scientific curiosity and this project, which proposes to investigate the process of encystation, lies at the intersection of these two forces. It is the most propitious time to address the challenging question of cyst wall formation in light of the most recent breakthroughs in the sensitivity of -omics approaches, the power of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in genome editing, the revolution in high-throughput microscopy, and ex-vivo tissue examination at the highest level of resolution.This ambitious and highly synergistic project tackles key biological questions on tissue cyst formation and capitalizes heavily on cutting-edge technologies to address three specific objectives:1. A comprehensive definition of the cyst wall composition. We will generate an unprecedentedly accurate transcriptome of the bradyzoite stage and a differential proteome of bradyzoites and the surrounding cyst wall. The data will be curated via a powerful comparative genomics approach spanning cyst-forming and cyst-lacking Apicomplexa species. A complementary mutagenesis and selection strategy is designed to identify specific defects in cyst formation or maturation by large-scale genetic screens using quantitative high-throughput microscopy.2. An uncovering of molecular mechanisms governing the cyst wall formation. This aim will be accomplished by taking a targeted as well as a global functional approach. Starting from recent findings on parasitophorous vacuole formation of tachyzoites we will implement a semi-targeted gene knockout- or conditional knockout approach. Moreover, the creation of a comprehensive gene disruption collection in subproject 1 will allow identification of all non-essential tachyzoites genes that display trafficking defects during cyst formation. Key mutants will be mechanistically dissected in vitro with a subset to be investigated further in vivo. 3. A spatiotemporal cartography of cyst formation in the brain. We will harness cutting-edge imaging methods to investigate the in vivo dynamics of dissemination and cyst formation in the whole body and foremost in the brain of a mouse infection model. These findings will inform development of spatiotemporal models describing parasite dissemination and differentiation, to be correlated with data from post-mortem biopsies. By combining unbiased and targeted experimental approaches, we are poised to achieve major conceptual advances in deciphering the molecular events leading to cyst wall formation. In the long term, the data and technology created in this project will lay the foundation to decoding the molecular information exchange between host and pathogen during establishment of life-long latent infections. These studies fill a significant knowledge gap and will provide i) highly valuable web-accessible integrated gene expression data, ii) fundamental discoveries about the regulatory and trafficking circuits that govern formation of the cyst wall as a biological barrier during encystation iii) invaluable paradigms of how the parasite initiates and sustains molecular programs required for disease progression and persistence.

Over the course of evolution, eukaryotes have acquired mitochondria to perform efficient energy conversion from food and oxygen into ATP, a process called oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Mitochondrial OXPHOS and cytosolic glycolysis are the two major pathways for generating cellular ATP and cells are exquisitely tuned to dynamically match nutrient fuel sources and energy demands. Much of our understanding of mitochondrial and metabolic rewiring in response to fuel sources has been elucidated using yeast as a model system. However we currently lack a systems biology view of this process in humans. Elucidating these fundamental cellular pathways is crucial for understanding and treating mitochondrial dysfunction, which underlies human diseases ranging from neonatal lethality to type II diabetes, cancer and neurodegeneration.In exciting preliminary studies, I have harnessed the ability of human K562 cells to quickly rewire metabolism from glycolysis to mitochondrial OXPHOS when glucose is replaced by galactose in the media. Here, I propose to leverage our lab’s deep expertise in genomics and systems biology to decipher mechanisms underlying the mitochondrial “activation” and “deactivation” in response to changes in sugar availability. Specifically, I will (1) identify the markers of mitochondrial activation by systematic RNA, protein and metabolite profiling during nutrient shifting, (2) identify genetic drivers of mitochondrial activation using genome-wide CRISPR and ORF screening and (3) integrate these results to decipher molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial activation. These findings are likely to help our understanding of cellular metabolism as well as mitochondrial function and pathologies.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Advanced Postdoc.Mobility	None	None

In principle, it allows for the DNA within a cell to be changed. With the dawn of new gene editing technologies such as CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 9), repairing mutations within human cells has become reality. Our ability to program this bacterial defense mechanism with human target sequences has unlocked unprecedented possibilities for gene therapy and personalized medicine.While deleting a gene to impair its function within a cell is presently fairly easy, the reversion of a detrimental mutation back to its non-disease state is much more difficult. This requires exchange of one sequence by another, which is only entirely precise when mediated by a process called homologous recombination or homology directed repair (HDR). While CRISPR-Cas9 has made gene editing by homologous recombination easier, its efficiency remains poor. This is a major limitation that must be overcome if genome editing technologies are to be used in medical treatments or commercial applications in biotechnology. The majority of research that focuses on improving CRISPR-Cas9 has tried to modify the components of the bacterial Cas9 system. Our approach, however, addresses this problem from a completely different perspective. We have shown that one can greatly increase repair by homologous recombination by making the cell’s genome more accessible to the editing machinery. Simply put, reverting a mutation by gene editing is like trying to cut a metal wire with a pair of office scissors; this still works but is very inefficient. Instead, our method changes the metal wire into a piece of string, allowing the scissors to cut easily. The underlying evidence for this project stems from our research in budding yeast, where we showed that making DNA more accessible enhances the rate of genome integrations 4-fold. If true in mammalian cells, this research could become a fundamental aspect of genome editing, applicable not only to CRISPR-Cas9 but also to any gene editing technologies yet to come.With the support of the Bridge funding for a Proof of Concept, I will expand our previous work from yeast to human cells. I plan to develop compounds that can be used to transiently lower histone levels in human cell culture. My ultimate goal is to increase the accessibility of DNA in the context of gene editing to enhance CRISPR-Cas9 editing efficiencies in somatic cells. I aim to establish the data necessary to bridge from basic research to a tool that will enable the use of gene editing for biotech or medical applications.

In such cases, prognosis have not improved over the last dec-ades and outcome is still unacceptably low. Only a limited number of studies directly address this prob-lem, mainly because in vivo model systems to mimic recurrences and identify novel drug sensitivities are lacking. One additional problem specific to pediatric malignancies is the paucity of actionable mutations that can be identified both from diagnostic as well as relapse samples. Hence, existing recurrent genetic abnormalities such as translocation events gain additional weight and we can hypothesize that other mechanisms such as epigenetic transcriptional control might play a major role in disease development. To specifically address these topics, we suggest in this proposal to take advantage of our novel insights that have recently been obtained during the current funding period. We are also proud that we are now part of a very large European initiative which will allow us to substantially expand our collection of pa-tient-derived xenografts and which will be used in most of the proposed projects. To gain novel insights into development and treatment of recurrent disease, we will address the following specific aims: Aim 1: To establish a personalized drug screening platform and identify novel treatment vulnerabilities directly in patient derived primary cell cultures. We hypothesize that new sequencing efforts of recurrent samples have to be supplemented with functional drug screens to advance treatment of relapsed patients. In addition, our platform serves as discovery tool to identify novel mechanisms of drug resistances and novel biomarkers for patient selection.Aim 2: To further validate CHD4 as major drug target in pediatric malignancies and describe the epi-genetic landscape of fusion positive-RMS tumors in general. We hypothesize that CHD4, a newly iden-tified crucial co-factor of the RMS specific fusion protein PAX3-FOXO1, has a more widespread function as epigenetic reader than previously appreciated. In addition, we will use unbiased large scale screens to identify novel epigenetic vulnerabilities in RMS tumors.Aim 3: To identify novel (chemo)resistance mechanisms directly in patient derived tumor material and develop novel rational combinatorial treatment strategies. Using both unbiased in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 drop-out screens and a hypothesis driven approach investigating the contribution of hedgehog signaling, and by comparing diagnostic versus relapse samples from the same patients, we will identify resistance mechanisms that will guide combinatorial drug development, aiming at re-sensitizing tumors that are resistant to commonly applies chemotherapeutics. We expect that this follow-up proposal will provide relevant novel insights into RMS biology and pro-gression by working directly with patient material and will contribute novel pre-clinical information to guide development of targeted therapies into early phase I/II clinical protocols.

A plethora of functions have been attributed to these proteases such as killing pathogens, inactivating toxins, inducing death of infected or cancer cells, modulating cytokine activity and remodeling extracellular matrix proteins. Much progress has been made in the last decade in understanding the functions of intracellular serpins which inhibit granule proteases of immune cells. Importantly, we have established that Serpinb1 is an essential survival factor of neutrophils (PMNs) through the inhibition of their own granule protease CatG. CatG triggers a form of programmed cell death that has features of apoptosis through activation of caspases and of regulated necrosis with rapid loss of plasma membrane integrity and release of inflammatory mediators. Although we have made significant advances, the exact molecular mechanisms leading to cell death and inflammation in the absence of intracellular serpins remain to be identified. In this project, we will use a combination of targeted (hypothesis-driven) and untargeted (degradomics and phenotype screening) methods to address the knowledge gaps in the mechanisms of CatG-mediated cell death and in the functions of Serpinb1, Serpinb6 and Serpinb9 in vivo. In particular, we have taken the high risk, high reward approach of mouse genetics and developed unique models to directly address these important questions. The proposed project will address the following two aims: Our first specific aim is to identify the mechanisms of cell death mediated by cathepsin G in myeloid cells. We will focus on the biology of myeloid cells and further explore specific cell death pathways associated with PMN and monocyte PCD in vitro. We will use a comparative proteomic approach to identify the CatG-specific degradome in PMNs associated with cell death. The identified targets will be validated by genetic targeting, including CRISPR and Cas9 designer nuclease technology. The second specific aim is to investigate the global and individual functions of the 14 functional serpins encoded in the expanded mouse SerpinB6-SerpinB9-SerpinB1 gene cluster on mouse chromosome 13, for which we generated a complete, yet viable knock-out. We will investigate specific defects of innate and adaptive immune cell development, homeostasis in steady state and inflammatory conditions. We will particularly investigate the cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous functions of invariant NKT cell subsets, which appear to be negatively regulated by SerpinB1 and, potentially, also by other intracellular serpins of this cluster. Finally, we will perform a standardized, comprehensive phenotypic screening of mice lacking all clade B serpin genes on mouse chromosome 13. This explorative analysis will be followed by a second stage testing where identified defects will be functionally investigated for individual serpin genes and their known target proteases. Overall, this multipronged project based on animal genetics will identify and functionally validate novel proteolytic targets associated with programmed cell death and will reveal important pathophysiological mechanisms mediated by granule proteases of immune cells and their inhibitors, which will likely have implications for developmental, inflammatory, infectious and proliferative diseases.

What molecular programs specify the LPM within the embryonic mesoderm and subsequently pattern it into the bilateral stripes that differentiate into its descendant cell fates remain unknown. The goals of my proposed projects is to chart previously elusive cell fates of the LPM and to uncover the molecular regulation of LPM formation using the zebrafish (Danio rerio) as principal model. Understanding LPM formation and patterning will provide a developmental framework of how key features of the vertebrate body plan evolved. Further, an improved mechanistic grasp of LPM formation will provide a concept to understand the genetic causes of congenital cardiovascular disorders.The zebrafish embryo provides a unique model to tackle LPM formation with its rapid development, optical translucency, and potent genetic toolbox. In our previous and ongoing work, we have uncovered several cis-regulatory elements that are specifically active in the emerging LPM in different vertebrate species. Our experiments allow us to track the forming LPM in unprecedented detail, have revealed an ancient, evolutionarily conserved program that drives LPM formation, and enabled us to add additional cell fates of LPM descent. We have further maximized mutagenesis with CRISPR-Cas9 to rapidly probe the developmental contribution of genes and cis-regulatory elements accompanied by state-of-the-art sequence analysis.Here, we will combine live lightsheet microscopy (SPIM) of unique LPM reporter strains, genetic lineage tracing, chromatin analysis, and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutagenesis to investigate the regulation of LPM emergence and cell migration. In Aim 1, we will address open questions concerning the LPM’s cell fate architecture. In Aim 1A, we will combine latest transgenic zebrafish techniques to investigate the controversial origins of individual endothelial lineages during body plan formation. In Aim 1B, we will pursue the identity of individual LPM stripes, which have received conflicting definitions in the past.For Aim 2, we will chart and functionally investigate the regulatory landscape of emerging LPM territory and will probe the regulation of its dynamic cell migration. In Aim 2A, we will chart the regulatory landscape of the emerging LPM with chromatin analysis and will establish the developmental contribution of individual cis-regulatory elements as basis for targeting putative enhancers in vivo using our new CRISPR-Cas9 tools. We will complement this approach in Aim 2B with somatic CRISPR-Cas9-based mutagenesis of migration- and adhesion-controlling candidate genes to elucidate how the spatio-temporal migration pattern in the LPM is coordinated. Altogether, our aims will elucidate fundamental open questions in vertebrate development, and will establish a new paradigm for discovering and functionally validating cis-regulatory elements and molecular regulators in vivo.

In eukaryotes, the cytosolic Hsp90 is essential, undoubtedly because of its central role in the proteostasis system. With the help of a large cohort of cofactors (co-chaperones), it associates with a substantial portion of all proteins, and constitutes a major hub of the proteome. Hsp90 clients include many regulatory and signaling proteins that depend on it to stabilize thermodynamically metastable states. The mitochondrial Hsp90 isoform Trap1, a simplified version of an Hsp90 machine, regulates cellular energy metabolism. Despite a recent explosion of the Hsp90/Trap1 literature, their in vivo functions in normal and cancer cells remain poorly understood. We propose to fill some of these knowledge gaps with a multi-pronged approach.Specific goals:•Genetic dissection of the Hsp90 machine in the mouse: Understand the global physiological and pathological functions of this molecular chaperone machine in a complex model organism. For the core components Hsp90 and Hsp90, and for the co-chaperones Aha1, Aha2, and Aarsd1, we will study the phenotypes of constitutive or conditional gene deletions at a global level and for selected tissues, and try to link phenotype with genotype mechanistically.•Functional interactions at the cellular level: Elucidate the essential functional interactions of this major molecular chaperone machine and proteome hub by genome-wide synthetic lethal and chemogenomic screens with mammalian cell lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. These screens for essential interacting genes will be done with cells lacking Hsp90, Hsp90, or the co-chaperone Stip1/Hop, or treated with an Hsp90 inhibitor or exposed to other proteostasis perturbations.•Hsp90 and cancer: Discover why cancer cells are more Hsp90-dependent and hypersensitive to Hsp90 inhibitors. A key tool for the analysis of the role of individual factors and pathways will be an isogenic pair of normal and Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells. •Synthetic chaperone: Strip Hsp90 down to the bare essentials by reconstructing it into a synthetic chaperone. Identify the absolutely essential core functions and the significance of Hsp90 heterodimers.•Live cell imaging of Hsp90 interactions: Develop luminescence resonance energy transfer with lanthanide ions as a powerful tool to do 'real-time in vivo biochemistry' of the Hsp90 machine.•Mitochondrial Hsp90 isoform Trap1: Understand how Trap1 regulates cellular energy metabolism and how this affects physiological cellular processes such as the regulation of cell size and cell migration, and, as a long-term goal, pathological events such as cancer and other diseases.

Other typical OI features such as blue sclerae, dentinogenesis imperfecta and hearing loss are not consistently present. Homozygous mutations in TMEM38B gene encoding for a potassium channel (TRIC-B) are responsible for the disease. TRIC-B is present in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane of non excitable cells and allows the potassium ions to move from the cytosol to the ensoplasmic reticulum (ER), thus acting as positive charge exchanger required for the exit of positive calcium ions from the ER without altering the potential membrane. Calcium homeostasis is very important for cellular function. The exact molecular mechanism linking the loss of TRIC-B function to the skeletal phenotype in OI type XIV is still unknown. The aim of our research will be to develop and use in vitro and in vivo models to test the hypothesis that altered proliferation and differentiation caused by altered intracellular calcium concentration could be causing OI type XIV bone fragility. The TMEM38B gene will be knocked out by CRISPR/Cas9 genomic engineering tool in an immortalized human osteoblast line widely used as model for osteoblastogenesis investigation. Proliferation and differentiation will be evaluated in control and mutated cells. To confirm our in vitro data we plan to generate a zebrafish model for OI type XIV using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology to knock out tmem38b gene. The success of the targeting will be demonstrated at the gene and protein level and mutant zebrafish bone phenotype will be investigated to validate it as model for OI type XIV. If successful the project will allow the identification of some of the molecular mechanism responsible for OI type XIV and will provide useful in vitro and in vivo tools for future investigation of the disease mechanism	Telethon Italy	Telethon Exploratory Project	47350.0	EUR

All of these proteins can carry mutations related to heart disease. Aims My aim is to understand the process of muscle regulation and the effects of mutations at a molecular level. This requires high resolution structures of the macromolecular complex. Cryo-Electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) provides a means of achieving sub-nanometer 3D structures of these filaments that cannot be crystallised. 3D maps of the thin filament in different functional states will provide insight into the mechanism of regulation. In addition, I intend to look at the difference in the secondary structure of the proteins caused by mutations that are known to cause Cardio myopathies. Objectives • Isolate native thin filaments from zebrafish cardiac muscle. The wild type filaments will be prepared in a relaxed (Calcium free) and active (Calcium treated) state. • Use CRISPR technology to engineer in cardio myopathy causing mutations in zebrafish. Isolate native thin filaments from mutants • Freeze these samples in amorphous ice preserving their native state. • Image the frozen samples using the new 200kVTalos Artica Cryo-TEM and Gatan K2 detector at Bristol. • Carry out a non-helical single particle analysis of the data enabling all of the information regarding the regulatory proteins to be recovered. • Dock known crystal structures into the 3D density maps resulting in atomic models of the thin filament.

Indeed, these diseases affect millions of people and proper treatment options are limited. However, therapeutic drug use improvement is currently leading to interesting approaches that are being developed. Moreover, the eye is an organ ideal for therapeutic treatments: it is small, easily accessible and isolated from the systemic circulation through several barriers.Over the past years, several delivery strategies have been developed. The most frequently used method remains intravitreous injection of therapeutic proteins. Although effective, this technique presents several drawbacks and the major one is the repeated injection and its related pain from which patients suffer. Therefore, strategies ensuring a continuous delivery of drug are needed, and the most studied delivery method that fulfills these criteria is gene therapy. The principle underlying gene therapy is the use of eye tissues as factory to the in situ production of active compounds. Instead of injecting active compounds into the eye, nucleic acids are transduced into cells.There are two different approaches for ocular gene therapy: viral and non-viral gene transfer. Viral gene therapy in the eye is the more frequently studied, but involves safety issues. One of them is the fact that to limit quantity of viral particles and side effects, viruses have to be injected subretinal, leading to retinal detachment. This procedure is very expensive (many hours of surgery) and very dangerous (even not recommended). Secondly viruses are very useful when a precise biochemical function needs to be restored. But in the case of non-specific and sustained protein production they are not worthy. Viral gene therapy is very expensive and the cost/profit ratio is very high, because of virus production procedure and the selection of patients through genotyping. The aim is to treat millions of different patient through a single procedure, and not only selected ones possess the correct genotype for viral application. Finally, concerns persistence of the virus in the brain are still present using viruses. Non-viral gene therapies overcome these drawbacks and represent a safer and cheaper way to produce a targeted large amount of therapeutic proteins. In this project, the method of choice will be electroporation. The principle is to apply an electric field on the target tissue after DNA injection. This further ensures the entrance of DNA into the cell and nucleus through electro- induced pores. To obtain the transfection, electric and mechanical (device) parameters should be carefully set up. Electroporation has already been shown to be very effective in many tissues of the human body, and in rat eye. It is a very promising non-viral gene therapy strategy, its efficiency is proven, it is low cost, and relatively easy-to-use.Objectives of the projectIn the first part will optimize the transfection efficacy in vivo. In second part I will measure and evaluate the expression time of the plasmid. In thethird part I will optimize the mechanical and electrical parameters to fit the new pig animal-model.Methods1) Efficiency of transfection: different plasmid backbones will be used, and different states ofplasmid compaction will be tested to find the most efficient one. Different plasmid concentrations, promoters and different type of solutions in which DNA lays will be tested as well. Steroid as nuclearisation enhancer and SMAR will be used to increase transfection efficiency.2) Plasmid expression: plasmid peak of expression and the kinetic of expression arrest will be calculated. Furthermore mechanisms that lead to plasmid expression extinction will be analyzed, to discriminate if transcription inhibitors are activated or DNA degraded.3) Mechanical and electrical optimization for pig animal-model: electric and mechanical optimization will be performed in this part. Furthermore theoretical modeling of electric field will be done in collaboration with an EPFL partner (team of Philippe Renaud).4) Gene editing with CRISPR/Cas9: in collaboration with the team of Diego Ghezzi at the EPFL we will develop the suprachoroidal electrotransfer for gene editing in the retinal pigment epithelium and the photoreceptor layers.

191	Volker Heussler	University of Berne	Institut für Zellbiologie Departement Biologie Universität Bern	2015-08-01	2018-07-31	Pathogen-host cell interactions during the liver stage of Plasmodium parasites	During the current funding period, we could show that egress of Plasmodium parasites is initiated by the activation of a parasite-derived phospholipase (PbPL for P. berghei phospholipase) that is involved in the destruction of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM). Furthermore, we could define a new host cell autophagy pathway that is involved in the recognition and labeling of the PVM in infected hepatocytes. For the next funding period, we propose to concentrate on these two successfully initiated projects, both centered on the role of the PVM during parasite development and egress. Parasite egress from hepatocytes is clearly separated into two phases. One is the destruction of the PVM, liberating merozoites into the cytosol of the host cell. This phase is followed by the transport of merozoites, within host cell-derived vesicles (merosomes), into the blood stream where they are liberated from the host cell to infect red blood cells (RBCs). To decipher parasite egress, we will concentrate on the molecular events relating to PVM rupture. It appears that phospholipases play a crucial role in this event and we have identified putative phospholipases that localize to the PVM at the end of liver stage development. Their roles will be investigated using reverse genetics. Interaction partners of the PVM-localized phospholipases will be identified to understand how the activity of phospholipases is regulated. In addition we will continue to further analyze the activation of PbPL and in particular whether proteases play a role in this process. For the second part of this project, we propose to further investigate the role of host cell autophagy in parasite elimination as well as strategies used by the parasite to escape this host cell response and even to use it as an additional source of nutrients. In particular, we plan to manipulate autophagy pathways by genetic modification of the host cell using the powerful CRISPR/Cas9 technology.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div.

Accumulating amounts of evidence implicate that mitochondrial dysfunction is involved in pathogenesis of a number of kidney diseases. Despite its apparent importance, however, little is known about roles played by mitochondria in renal function and disease. In particular, mitochondrial contribution to the filtration barrier function of podocytes in the kidney glomerulus is largely unknown. This lack of understanding is mainly due to technical difficulties in investigating this highly dynamic organelle in vivo. Glomeruli in the mouse kidney are not easily accessible by microscopy in the living animal while in vitro cell culture systems do not reliably model cellular metabolism in the proper physiological context. Therefore, there is a need for a new model system that allows for in vivo analyses of mitochondrial dynamics and activity. With the optical clarity of embryos and the ease of transgenesis, the zebrafish offers an ideal system to study mitochondria by intravital imaging. In addition, recent advancements in site-directed mutagenesis technologies (e.g. CRISPR/Cas9 system) achieve generations of mutant zebrafish in a short period of time. In this project, taking advantage of these useful features, mitochondrial dynamics and activity in podocytes will be characterized in genetically tractable transgenic zebrafish. Moreover, by utilizing transgenesis with metabolic biosensors, such as those for ATP and NADH, podocyte cellular metabolism associated with mitochondrial function will also be investigated in vivo. By analyzing mitochondrial properties and associated metabolic parameters in experimental zebrafish models for glomerular disease, this study aims to elucidate underlying mechanisms by which mitochondrial dysfunction leads to development of nephrotic syndrome.

193	Yvan Arsenijevic	University of Lausanne	Hôpital Ophtalmique Jules Gonin	2017-01-01	2019-12-31	Dissecting the role of Polycomb proteins during retinal degeneration	During the past years, our group demonstrated that several proteins involved in cell cycle regulation are expressed in different mouse models of retinal degeneration. Through our research funded by the SNF we identified the CDKs and the Polycomb component BMI1 as the key actors during the process of photoreceptor death studied in the Rd1 mouse retina: the in vivo inhibition of Bmi1 rescues around 70% of the photoreceptors and significantly preserves cone function (Zencak et al., PNAS 2013). Because Polycomb proteins regulate gene expression by chromatin modifications, other members of this family were studied. We observed that the histone methyltransferase EZH2 is expressed during the early degenerative stage and results in the methylation of H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a histone modification maintaining gene inhibition. Interestingly, the pattern of H3K27me3 mark observed in our studies correlates with that of degenerating photoreceptors. In vivo EZH2 inhibition by a chemical compound protects around 50% of photoreceptors. Thus, the major objective of this project is to identify the epigenetic mechanisms controlling cell death events with a special focus on those involving cell cycle protein regulation. The importance of EZH2 in the regulation of the photoreceptor death process will be challenged in vivo. We are currently performing ChIP-Seq studies for the different histone marks as well as for BMI1 in order to identify which genes are differently controlled by the Polycomb protein during retinal degeneration. The results will reveal candidate genes which will be correlated with the data of the EZH2 ablation studies, as well with RNA-Seq and micro-RNA array studies that will be undertaken in this project with WT, Rd1 and Rd1;Bmi1-/- mouse retina. The overall analysis should disclose which pathways are regulated by the Polycomb proteins during the process of photoreceptor loss using new algorithms we recently developed.The biology of human photoreceptor death is poorly known. Human retina explants will be cultivated with PDE6 inhibitors to induce photoreceptor death, allowing the study of human mechanisms of degeneration. The death process identified in mouse retinas will be compared with the data from the human samples. In order to model the human disease in vitro without the problem of tissue source, human iPS cell lines will be engineered by a CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing approach to knock-down the PDE6B gene. These different models combined with the results obtained with mouse material will help to identify candidate genes involved in the photoreceptor death process. The different candidates will be cloned into plasmids and challenged by electroporation into Rd1 retina explants (and then studied in vivo) to evaluate their role on the death mechanisms. These experiments will allow to link the systems involving EZH2, BMI1 and CDKs in the progression of the photoreceptor death with other pathways. Since we observed that BMI1 plays a major role in cell death control, the mechanisms regulating its actions will help to identify targets that can be relevant for therapeutic intervention.

Recent studies have identified essential but partially redundant roles for the related transcription factors (TFs), Brn-3a and Brn-3b, in developing hearts. Thus, double Brn-3a/Brn-3b KO (dKO) mutant mice are embryonically lethal but increased Brn-3b in Brn-3a knock-out (KO) mouse hearts can support survival until birth. However, aberrant Brn-3b in Brn-3a KO hearts causes unique abnormalities linked to increased Brn-3b target genes that affect cardiomyocyte (CM) fate and function. Studies in zebrafish (ZF) also showed that morpholino oligonucleotides (MO) to reduce both Brn-3a and Brn-3b causes looping and valve defects in double morphant hearts. However, the roles for Brn-3a and Brn-3b in developing hearts are still to be investigated. This project aims to: (i) Study roles for Brn-3a and Brn-3b during early heart development using ZF mutants generated using CRISPR/ cas9 editing. (2) Analyse the relationship between Brn-3a and Brn-3b in developing mouse hearts using conditional single and double mutants (cardiac-specific or inducible). (3) Examine mechanism of action by identifying common and unique target genes regulated by Brn-3a and Brn-3b in developing hearts.	British Heart Foundation	Project Grant	279267.0	GBP

Understanding granule function could lead to new treatments for haemostatic and cardiovascular diseases. I will focus on NBEAL2 variants, which cause Gray Platelet Syndrome (GPS), a rare bleeding disorder. Molecular studies on cells from patients and knockout mice show Nbeal2 is key to PLT alpha-granule and NEU specific granule regulation and function. I will use iPSC technology and CRISPR genome editing to elucidate the mechanism by which NBEAL2 variants cause granule pathology. Preliminary proteomics studies of iMKs have identified 64 proteins interacting with Nbeal2. Hypothesis 1: GPS variants cause loss of function of one/several interactions with Nbeal2 I will introduce by CRISPR-editing the codons for GPS-causing BEACH-domain variants M2080K, P2100L and G2290W to generate mutants of the line IPSC-S4_NBEAL2_TAP for forward programming to iMKs in biological triplicates (Ghevaert lab protocol; transcription factors GATA-1, FLI-1, TAL-1; tetracycline inducible expression). I will characterise iMKs by ATAC- and RNA- seq, confocal and electron microscopy, platelet formation/function assays and perform pulldowns. Nbeal2's interactions will be defined through proteomics analysis by mass spectrometry (Lamond laboratory) and loss-of-interaction(s) will be confirmed by bi-directional immunoblots, co-localisation and proximity ligation assays. Hypothesis 2: Proteins in the Nbeal2 interactome have increased likelihood of being candidates for inherited blood cell disorders I will apply a new Bayesian algorithm to analyse genome sequencing data for ~750 unexplained BPD cases to determine if the 64 genes encoding Nbeal2's interactors are enriched for rare, possibly causal variants. I will verify putative candidate variants using control databases, detailed clinical phenotyping and co-segregation of pedigrees and functional studies using a CRISPR-knockout iPSC line.

In recent years the number of individuals identified with disease phenotypes mapped to KLF1 mutations has increased rapidly. Of these the most severe, a form of dyserythropoietic anemia, is causally linked with the monoallelic mutation E325K; the effect of this mutation more severe than monoallelic loss of function KLF1 mutations. However, how the mutation affects the function of KLF1 in vivo resulting in a dominant phenotype is not known. Studying the molecular defects behind many RBC diseases is severely impeded by paucity of suitable and adequate quantities of material from anemic patients. We have recently developed technology and generated the first human immortalized adult erythroid lines, which recapitulate erythropoiesis, and provide a sustainable supply of cells. We have also developed a platform for CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing of these lines. We will use these technologies to create model disease cellular systems, generating a line from a patient with the E325K mutation, and introducing the mutation into an existing line. These systems will be used to (i) obtain a comprehensive map of the complete repertoire of proteins aberrantly expressed in cells expressing E325K KLF1 by comparative proteomics (ii) delineate molecular mechanisms by which the E325K mutation results in disrupted gene regulation, specifically determining if E325K KLF1 exhibits altered DNA binding specificity in vivo and if it interferes with the occupancy rate of wild type KLF1 at gene regulatory regions by ChIP-seq, and how E325K KLF1 then distorts the genetic readout of cells via analysis of chromatin configuration at gene loci required for interaction of regulatory elements and thus regulated gene expression using Capture-C 3C (iii) whether the mutation perturbs KLF1-co-factor binding required for such interactions. The data will also provide further insight into KLF1-directed transcriptional control.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	712016.0	GBP

Investigate how abnormal epigenetic gene regulatory mechanisms result in differentiation block and leukaemic transformation in IDHm AML. 2. Investigate the molecular mechanisms of action of mutant IDH inhibitors in inducing differentiation of AML, focusing on effects on transcription factors involved in normal granulocyte-monocyte (GM) differentiation. Methodology 1. Compare gene expression, DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility, performed in parallel (multi-genomics) in normal bone marrow versus AML. Perform unbiased genome-wide bioinformatic analysis, and analysis focused on differentially expressed transcription factors required for normal GM differentiation (GM-TFs) but suppressed in AML. 2. Test the hypothesis that failure to express GM-TFs results in leukaemic transformation using CRISPR knockdown of candidate GM-TFs in IDH1-mutant preleukaemic mouse model. 3. Perform multi-genomic sequencing on mIDHi-treated AML LSC in vitro to investigate how mIDHi upregulates GM-TFs. Identify GM-TFs upregulated with mIDHi in responsive AML samples but which remain repressed in non-responsive samples. Test if re-expression restores response in resistant AML samples. 4. Correlate GM-TFs required for response (from point 3) with gene expression in IDHm AML patients who are resistant to mIDHi treatment in vivo. These may be important targets for novel therapies. Applications and benefits This work will improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of differentiation block and its contribution to pathogenesis of AML. It will help explain why differentiation therapies may not cure patients. The data has the potential to identify new genes/ pathways that should be targeted by novel therapies to improve clinical outcomes. It will provide the rationale for design of future clinical trials of combination therapy. Multi-genomic characterisation of patients may be useful as a prognostic tool, and to guide therapeutic decisions.	Medical Research Council	Fellowship	804610.0	GBP

The ThromboGenomics (TG) high throughput sequencing (HTS) test, introduced as a diagnostic test in the NHS in 2015 identifies causal variants in VWF exons. There is an assumption, partially supported by TG test results that a fraction of VWF variants, labelled in reference databases as LPV and PV have been erroneously ascribed their label. Therefore, the fraction of type 1 VWD patients in whom a conclusive molecular diagnosis can be reached may be lower than the estimated 75%. I will use HTS to analyse the 0.5 MB comprising the VWF-CD9 genes in 1,000 VWD patients to identify LPVs in non-coding elements of the locus through comparison with data from 10,000 WGS-analysed controls from the INTERVAL RCT. I will perform a fine-mapping analysis to associate variants in the 0.5 MB and VWF levels. I will then use a new Bayesian algorithm to search for rare variants enriched in the 1,000 VWD patients using 42,000 INTERVAL and 100KGP controls. Erroneous assignment of pathogenicity status to variants will be minimised by having access to NHS record data of the WGS controls, in contrast to the anonymised whole exome sequenced (WES) samples from the ExAC Consortium. There is a considerable chance that a DNA variant present in a regulatory element of VWF and observed in a few or a single VWD patient(s) but absent from the 42,000 controls is not causal of VWD. So putative causal DNA variants will be verified for co-segregation in pedigrees. Those that co-segregate will be selected for functional validation. The variant will be introduced in iPSCs by CRISPR-Cas9. Wild-type and edited iPSCs will be forward programmed into ECs and MKs, in which I will measure VWF transcript and VWF protein levels. The genome-editing is relatively simple for insertions/deletions but challenging for single nucleotide variants. So as a back-up approach iPSC lines will be generated from the relevant patients.

199	Dr Andrew Blackford	University of Oxford	None	2016-06-01	2022-05-31	Defining the molecular anatomy of the Bloom syndrome tumour suppressor complex	Background:Mutations caused by DNA damage enable a normal cell to become cancerous, and individuals with disorders caused by mutations in many DNA repair genes are predisposed to cancer. One such disorder is Bloom syndrome, which results from mutations in the gene encoding the BLM helicase. Apart from surgery, the most effective cancer treatments work in tumour cells by inducing DNA damage. Exploiting knowledge of the DNA damage response is therefore likely to lead to more effective and personalised cancer therapies in future.Like all biological pathways, DNA repair relies on protein-protein interactions to function. However, in any protein network it is a major challenge to identify functionally important peptide motifs and the protein domains that recognise them. Thus, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of which DNA damage response proteins functionally interact with each other and, crucially, how they are regulated.Methods:We will address this issue by using a bioinformatics pipeline that can predict functional peptide motifs and post-translational modifications with a high degree of accuracy. After applying this method, interacting proteins for novel motifs identified this way will be determined using a proteomics approach. The physiological importance of newly identified protein-protein interactions will then be validated in human cells using cutting-edge CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing methods.As proof-of-principle, we will concentrate initially on the proteins that make up the Bloom syndrome complex. Preliminary analyses using the pipeline have identified a novel motif in BLM centred around Ser304, which we have found is required for maintenance of genome stability by binding to the DNA replication and checkpoint protein, TopBP1.Aims:1. To identify and characterise novel and functionally important peptide motifs in the Bloom syndrome complex, and the protein domains that recognise them;2. To establish the mechanistic and structural basis for the phosphorylation-dependent interaction between BLM and TopBP1, and how it is regulated in cells.How the results of this research will be used:By exploiting recent advances in molecular phylogenetics and genome editing, this work will provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms that control a key DNA repair complex. In addition, the novel methods described here will provide an experimental framework that could readily be applied to investigate other biological pathways and thus have significant impact in other fields of cancer research.

The cancer stem cell hypothesis proposes that a rare subpopulation of cells within a tumor possesses the key features of stem cells, namely self-renewal and multi-potency, and that these stem-like cancer cells arise from oncogenic transformation of normal stem cells or closely related multi-potent progenitors. Patient-derived xenografts of prostate cancer represent excellent models to explore the biological and molecular implications of the cancer stem cell hypothesis in the progression to castration resistant prostate cancer, and to identify key features of putative stem/progenitor-like PCa cells that are likely to be at its origin. Based on our previous work and on ongoing studies on normal prostate epithelial stem/progenitor cells, we plan to investigate the two following aims:1. To identify/characterize pre-existing stem/progenitor-like PCa cells based on differential resistance to castration for survival and/or growth2. To investigate the molecular phenotype and/or genetic switch that confers androgen independent growth in a pre-existing stem/progenitor-like PCa cellsThe phenotype, genomic aberrations and the functional role of stem/progenitor-like prostate cancer cells as tumor-initiating/re-initiating cells in castration resistant prostate cancer will be studied in two pairs of patient-derived xenografts. Each pair of patient-derived xenografts represents models either of androgen independent prostate cancer for survival, but not growth (BM18 and PC-82 models) or of prostate cancer independent for both, survival and growth (LAPC-4/-9). According to the selection model, castration/regeneration strategy will facilitate the identification/selection of pre-existing in vivo tumor re-initiating, stem/progenitor-like prostate cancer cells under androgen deprivation. A parallel castration/regeneration strategy for in vitro organoid-initiating cell(s) from cell subpopulation(s) surviving castration in the four patient derived xenograft models will further certify their stem/progenitor-like properties (self-renewal, expansion and differentiation) and characterize their phenotype. An unique set of markers (ALDH, CD44, CRIPTO and MCAM) will be employed for their identification/selection. A comparative, genomic and transcriptomic analysis of tumor re-initiating and organoid-initiating stem/progenitor-like prostate cancer cell populations from the two sets of patient derived xenografts will be then performed. Putative, castration resistant prostate cancer-“driving” mutations found in LAPC-4/-9 will be assessed for functionality by genome editing (CRISPR-Cas9) in BM18 and PC-82.Our goal is to expand our understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling intrinsic resistance to androgen deprivation therapy. Such information will be important for understanding why prostate cancer relapse as castration resistant prostate cancer is invariably fatal and for developing better treatments for castration resistant prostate cancer. Additionally, these studies could lead to the identification of novel mechanisms of castration resistance that could be translated into biomarkers able to distinguish indolent from aggressive prostate cancer and provide surrogate end-point markers for monitoring prostate cancer treatments. The uniqueness of this proposal lies in: a) the assessment of the value of a novel stem/progenitor-like prostate cancer cell signature; b) the comparative phenotypic and genomic analysis of preclinical models, in vitro and in vivo, that differ in their capacity for growth progression under androgen deprivation; c) the reverse genetic approach on stem/progenitor-like prostate cancer cell; d) the evaluation of the prognostic value of the stem/progenitor-like prostate cancer cell signature(s) on tissue micro arrays.The proposed study may provide an invaluable translational tool for stratifying early-stage prostate cancer patients at risk of castration resistant prostate cancer progression. It may also propose novel therapeutic targets for a curative intent.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div. I-III)	429000.0	CHF

Organ shape is to a large extent determined by cell behaviour and cell behaviour is to a large extent regulated by cell-cell interaction and cell-matrix interaction, as well as by cell-cell signalling.A major interest of my laboratory over the last few years has been to determine how branching morphogenesis restructures epithelial or endothelial structures such as the insect tracheal or the vertebrate vasculature. We have used high resolution live imaging with different marker proteins to analyse cell behaviour in vivo during the branching process. We are now increasing our efforts to better understand the molecular control of the relevant cell behaviours. With the help of the recently introduced genome editing tool Crispr/Cas, the task to mutate candidate genes has become straightforward, and we have already generate several mutants and characterized their role in angiogenesis. Since many genes/proteins are actively rather broadly and are required for basic cell functions such as cellular trafficking, cell division, etc., we have started to develop protein-manipulation tools which eventually should allow us to manipulate proteins in a cell- and time-induced manner. These tools are based on protein binders and we have pioneered the use of the later in multicellular systems some time ago. We are developing such protein-binder tools for proteins of interest in order to use them for protein trapping, degradation, miss-localization, ect. These studies should allow a novel view on the role of many proteins in angiogenesis, and pave the way to a molecular understanding of the fascinating process of branching morphogenesis.In the next granting period, we would like to address the following questions:1)How are cell rearrangement controlled and coordinated during the different steps of angiogenesis?2)How is the lumen formed during sprouting and anastomosis3)How are cell rearrangements and lumen formation controlled at the molecular level?In order to answer these questions, we will take the following experimental strategies:1)We will analyse the role of several proteins involved in the regulation of Ve-cadherin in cell rearrangements.2)We will analyse the role of trafficking in cell rearrangement and lumen formation.3)We will develop novel protein binder tools to manipulate proteins possibly involved in the above processes in a cell- and time-specific manner.4)We will try to establish CLEM in order to look at high resolution into endothelial cell during the branching process.

Organ shape is to a large extent determined by cell behaviour, and cell behaviour is to a large extent regulated by cell-cell signalling and cell mechanics. A major interest of my laboratory over the last few years has been to determine how branching morphogenesis restructures epithelial tissues to generate such fascinating structures as the trachea or the vasculature. While we have initially put much effort in understanding this process in vivo in an invertebrate system (tracheal development in Drosophila melanogaster) using state of the art genetics in combination with high resolution live imaging, we have recently moved much of our research efforts to vertebrates, in particular to zebrafish (Danio rerio). Using high resolution in vivo imaging, we have described the cellular activities during angiogenesis, in particular during sprouting, vessel fusion and vessel pruning. To our surprise, we find that the plasticity of developing vessels is accompanied by unexpected cell behaviour; endothelial cells can fission and self-fuse during anastomosis and pruning, respectively. With the advent of the recently introduced genome manipulation tools (TALEN, CRISPR/Cas9), a genetic dissection of the different steps in angiogenesis is now possible at unprecedented level, and proteins can be tagged at endogenous loci and used as marker for high resolution live imaging. We have recently applied intracellular nanobodies for the first time in developing drosophila embryos to directly manipulate protein function, in particular for protein degradation. We used an anti-GFP nanobody fused to an F-box in degrade GFP-fusion proteins (we called the method “deGradFP” for degrading GFP). In the meantime, we have functionalized the anti-GFP nanobody manifold, so that it can be used for in vivo protein trapping, protein localisation and for post-translation modification of proteins of interest. During the next granting period, we will introduce the use of intracellular nanobodies (and other protein binders) for studying the zebrafish vascular system, in particular to answer the following questions:Q1: How is the dynamic cell behaviour during sprouting controlled?Q2: How do endothelial cells recognize each other in order to connect?Q3: Which molecular processes are involved in luminal membrane expansion?Q4: Which molecular processes are involved in membrane fusion and membrane fission?In order to answer these questions, we propose to undertake the following experimental strategies:1) Investigate the role of VE-cad in the dynamic rearrangements of endothelial cells.2) Generate and use cutting edge in vivo live imaging tools to characterize molecular aspects of cell behaviour during angiogenesis processes.3) Generate and analyse mutations in candidate genes affecting distinct cellular activities.4) Generate and use novel tools to manipulate protein function in vivo - a step closer to a synthetic biology approach to organ formation.

203	Michael Dill	Camargo Laboratory Children's Hospital Boston	Camargo Laboratory Children's Hospital Boston	2017-05-01	2018-10-31	The role of YAP in liver cancer	Hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocellular carcinoma are the most common neoplasms of the liver and a global health concern, with very limited systemic treatment options.The Hippo/YAP-signaling pathway is an important regulator of liver organ size, as well as liver cell fate, and has been implicated in development of liver cancer. While the core Hippo pathway has been studied extensively, little is known about the actual downstream target effectors of YAP, which promote transcriptional output, especially in the context of tumorigenesis.We hypothesize that YAP is transcriptionally regulating relevant oncogenic drivers downstream to induce and maintain cancer. We further assume that dysregulated YAP is one of the important drivers of tumor maintenance. The aim of this ongoing project is to screen for and evaluate biologically relevant target effectors downstream of YAP and to better understand the role of YAP in tumor maintenance in the context of liver cancer.In the last months, we established an in vivo screen using a mouse model with hepatocyte-specific overexpression of a constitutive active YAP protein by deleting selected YAP target genes with a library of genomically integrated sgRNAs using the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system. Biologically and therapeutically attractive hits of the screen will be genetically and pharmacologically validated.Furthermore, we want to study the effect of YAP knockout in the setting of established liver tumors. To this end we are introducing CRISPR-Cas9 mediated mutations in commonly alterated tumor suppressor genes, and once liver tumors have established, analyze them for YAP activation and the effect of cancer cell-specific YAP knockout on tumor growth and biology.This study will provide a first systematic description of YAP targets in the context of carcinogenesis, and these findings have the potential to identify important downstream effectors as cancer drug targets. Further, we are going to better understand the biology of YAP in already established tumors.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Advanced Postdoc.Mobility	None	None
204	Michel Milinkovitch	University of Geneva	Département de Génétique et Evolution Faculté des Sciences Université de Genève	2016-03-01	2019-02-28	EvoDevo and Physics of Skin Colours	A few years ago, I obtained a SINERGIA grant together with Prof. Matthias Zwicker (Computer Science, Bern) and Dirk van der Marel (Condense Matter Physics, Geneva) with the ambition to initiate integration of biological, physical, and computer science approaches for a better understanding of skin colours and patterns of skin appendages and colour in amniotes. The skin appendages and pigmentation systems in vertebrates are promising model systems because species exhibit astonishing variations in skin appendage morphologies, as well as colour and colour patterns generated by pigments (black/brown, yellow and red) and structural elements (photonic crystals) incorporated into various types of chromatophores and iridophores, respectively. This variation is of great ecological importance as scales, feathers, hairs, and spines provide mechanical protection, and colours play critical roles in thermoregulation, photoprotection, camouflage, display, and reproductive isolation (hence, speciation). Our SINERGIA project was a success as we (a) Developed innovative robotics and computer graphics methods for automated phenotyping of skin surface (Martins, et al. 2015), (b) Used these developments for the analysis of scale patterns in crocodiles, a study that allowed us to uncover an entirely new developmental mechanism (Milinkovitch, et al. 2013), (c) Characterised unique multi-sensory micro-organs in the skin of crocodiles (Di-Poi and Milinkovitch 2013), (d) Characterised the development of skin appendages in the spiny mouse (Montandon, et al. 2014), (e) Characterised through histology, mass-spectrometry, photonic methods, and in-silico simulations the interactions between photonic nanostructures and pigmentary elements that generate extensive colour pattern variation in Phelsuma lizards (Saenko, et al. 2013), (f) Used mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data and Support-Vector-Machine (SVM) approaches to characterise the phylogeography of colour pattern variation in panther chameleons (Grbic, et al. 2015), (g) Combined biology and photonics to show that chameleons shift colour through active tuning of a lattice of guanine nanocrystals within a superficial thick layer of dermal iridophores (Teyssier, et al. 2015), (h) Characterised the physical parameters of surface-grating nano-structures (using electron and atomic-force microscopy) that are responsible for iridescence in snakes, and (i) used the knowledge acquired in point h to develop a new technique for computationally-effective and interactive simulation and rendering of diffraction effects produced by such biological nano-structures (Dhillon, et al. 2014). In addition, for linkage-mapping analyses, we have been continuously establishing, these last six years, families of corn snakes and lizards segregating mono-locus skin colour and colour pattern phenotypes.In the present multidisciplinary project, I propose to capitalise on our collaborations and combined expertise in computer science, physics and evolutionary developmental biology for the identification of the physical and biochemical self-organisation mechanisms underlying the formation of skin pigmentation and skin structural colours in squamate reptiles. This will require the development of biological and physical assays as well as new computer science methods, but the project will be greatly facilitated by the equipment, methodologies, and biological material, as well as the close multidisciplinary collaborations, that we have developed in the past. First, we will finalise the linkage mapping analysis of colour pattern mutations in snakes to identify the genes involved in these spectacular phenotypes. Second, we will produce ex-vivo culture of embryonic skin and tissue-disrupted in-vitro cell cultures from reptilian skin and we will treat these samples with pharmacological agents and CRISPR/Cas9 transgenesis to characterise the role of the identified (by linkage mapping) pathways in normal and mutant patterning. In parallel, we will improve and extend our 3D geometry and colour texture acquisition pipeline, perform quantitative analyses of phenotypes, characterise their variation, track changes during their development, and develop mathematical models to simulate pattern formation using Partial-Differential-Equations, Finite-Element and multi-resolution and Cell Automata Methods, all guided by our results on ex-vivo and in-vitro cultures. Third, we will perform hyperspectral imaging and advanced photonic crystallography (using scatterometry and near-field techniques) in chameleons, other lizards and snakes. These analyses will uncover the detailed physical and biological mechanisms explaining how squamate reptiles generate and manipulate structural colours, for example for changing colour during display as shown in our recent article on chameleons (Teyssier et al. 2015). The project is at the frontier between the physics of biology and evolutionary developmental biology. My multidisciplinary team of researchers (including physicists, computer scientists, developmental biologists, and evolutionary biologists), as well as the access to the laboratory equipment and competences in photonics of Prof. Dirk van der Marel’s team, will greatly facilitate our analyses of the evolution and ecological significance of signalling pathways and self-organisational phenomena involved in the determinism of adaptive skin colours and colour patterns.

Paediatric tumours have particularly benefited from advances in research in the last 30 years. However the treatment-associated long-term side effects induced by their lack of specificity to tumour cells and high dosage administration remain a challenging problem. As children are by definition long-term survivors, there is a strong need for the development of new, low-toxicity, better targeted and efficient therapeutic strategies for all types of childhood cancers. TAT-RasGAP317-326 is a cell-permeable peptide derived from the p120 RasGAP protein. This peptide does not modulate cell death by itself but, potently sensitizes adult tumour cells in vitro and in vivo to various anti-cancer treatments, including genotoxins and radiotherapy. Importantly, it displays specificity to cancer cells as it does not sensitize non-tumoral cells to genotoxin-induced apoptosis. TAT-RasGAP317-326 may therefore be of considerable benefit to children by increasing the efficacy of anti-cancer therapies, which could allow to lower their dosage and associated side-effects. Very encouraging in vitro preliminary results, obtained by screening various childhood cancer cell lines, indicate that pediatric tumours are sensitive to the sensitizing action of TAT-RasGAP317-326. As a consequence, we propose to undertake this project in collaboration with two laboratories. The first one is the Research in Pediatric Oncology Laboratory of CHUV directed by Dr Nicole Gross, who has extensive expertise in the biological and genetic mechanisms involved in the development of neuroblastoma, Ewing’s sarcoma and medulloblastoma. They have also developed in vivo orthotopic models for these types of tumours. The second one is the laboratory of Prof. Christian Widmann, who is highly experienced in the field of apoptosis and has developed the TAT-RasGAP317-326 peptide. This complementary expertise is a great advantage for both in vitro and in vivo experimentations. The aims of the present project are:•In vitro assessment of the response of childhood cancer cells to sensitization by TAT-RasGAP317-326; •Evaluation of the clinical potential of TAT-RasGAP317-326 by exploring its in vivo efficacy using well-characterized orthotopic and heterotopic nude mouse models;•Elucidation of the mode of action of TAT-RasGAP317-326 and more specifically its targets using both an unbiased immune-based pull-down approach and CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-Cas9) knockout technology.

206	Professor Oliver Bandmann	University of Sheffield	Neurosciences	2018-04-01	2021-03-31	In vivo pathway analysis to determine the mechanistic role of susceptibility genes for Parkinson's disease	Genome wide association (GWA) studies have identified 24 risk loci for sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). However, PD GWA loci often contain more than one gene. Furthermore, for most currently proposed PD GWA genes within the associated PD risk loci, the mechanisms linking them to PD are only tentative. The aim of this proposal is to undertake a biological validation of plausible PD GWA risk genes in zebrafish (Danio rerio), using a CRISPR/Cas-based, in vivo pathway analysis approach. Zebrafish offer unprecedented opportunities to rapidly study crucial aspects of PD GWA genes in a well characterised vertebrate model system. Zebrafish share greater sequence homology and are more likely to have functionally conserved mechanisms than other small model organisms. They also provide excellent opportunities to study the effect of GWA genes on a wide range of relevant mechanisms, including the 1. Dopaminergic neuronal activity in vivo, neurotransmitter homeostasis and loss of dopaminergic neurons; 2. Interaction between neuronal and non-neuronal cell death mechanisms (in particular neuroinflammation); 3. Interaction between PD GWA genes and ageing. We will combine neurophysiological, neurochemical, morphological and functional analyses with comparative RNA-seq based transcriptomic studies. Using the CRISPR/Cas strategy, we have already made stable mutant zebrafish lines for the PD GWA risk genes mccc1, gak, inpp5f, vps13c, gch1, sipa1l2, srebf1, acmsd, stx1b and tmem175 as well as additional stable mutant lines for the familial PD genes PINK1, LRRK2, Parkin and ATP13A2. The immediate availability of these lines will greatly accelerate the progress of this proposal. We will particularly focus on three pathobiological mechanisms, namely mitochondrial function/mitophagy, the autophagy/lysosome system and neuroinflammation. We will also undertake an in vivo gene-gene interaction screen to investigate PD GWA genes for their functional interaction with familial PD genes.

The two most important species, Theileria annulata and Theileria parva cause tropical theileriosis and East Coast fever (ECF) in cattle, respectively. T. parva alone is estimated to account for the death of >1 Mio cattle each year in sub-Saharan Africa with a substantial socio-economic impact and loss of US$ >300 Mio. One of the hallmarks of disease is the proliferation and dissemination of infected host cells into various organs. After tick transmission of sporozoites, leukocytes get invaded, followed by the development of schizont-forming parasites, and host cells acquire properties otherwise only known from cancer cells such as resistance to apoptosis, uncontrolled proliferation and metastatic potential. Despite considerable research efforts to link phenotypic changes and perturbed host cell signaling pathways, TaPIN1 is the only characterized Theileria effector protein to date that has been shown to contribute to host cell transformation. This absence of knowledge can mainly be attributed to a lack of genetic tools and a Theileria genome of ~4000 genes, half of which have no predicted function. In contrast, an arsenal of effector proteins has been discovered over the past decade in the highly tractable Toxoplasma system that hijacks host signaling pathways and takes control over gene expression. We aim to identify and characterize the function of novel Theileria effector proteins and explore how they interfere with cell signaling pathways and gene regulation that promote host cell transformation. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of genomic-scale analysis, the power of CRISPR/Cas9-based reverse genetics, a high throughput pathway analysis panel, life cell imaging and mass spectrometry. The specific aims of this proposal are (1) Identification of Theileria effector proteins and associated host cell manipulation; (2) CRISPR-based knockout of identified effector proteins; (3) Characterization of the host-pathogen protein interaction network. The characterization of novel Theileria effectors will be a fundamental step forward for the understanding on how Theileria transforms cells and causes disease. This knowledge may lead to improved interventions designed to reverse host cell transformation, thereby improving immune control of Theileria infection. It may also add new insights into cell physiology and pathway alterations in cancerous cells.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Ambizione	895928.0	CHF

This proposal aims to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying the substantial phenotypic variability observed in Joubert syndrome (JBTS), a neurodevelopmental Mendelian disorder part of the ciliopathy spectrum. To achieve this goal, the first step of the proposed research plan combines two experimental models with complementary strengths, namely zebrafish mutants and CRISPR/Cas9 genome-edited human induced-pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons, to compare the molecular consequences of loss-of-function in 4 different JBTS genes. This will untangle the shared effects of their loss-of-function from their diverging gene-specific effects. Second, I will take advantage of the variety of cilia-types present in zebrafish, mirroring the situation in humans, to investigate tissue-specific functions for each of the 4 genes. Finally, by generating zebrafish mutants carrying mutations in more than one gene, I will determine the combined effect of these mutations on the phenotypic outcome to investigate genetic modifiers. The enhanced understanding of the molecular consequences of JBTS gene mutations resulting from this work will increase our predictive ability for individual patients and set the stage for development of specific therapies.

During development, liver progenitors collectively move to form an organ primordium, where they differentiate into polarized epithelial cells. How progenitors actively self-organize and which factors are required in those processes is poorly understood, but pre-requisite for efficient stem cell differentiation and tissue engineering. I propose to pioneer a live imaging protocol to study at single cell resolution, how liver progenitors assemble into an organ in zebrafish embryos, transitioning from migratory into polarized cells. To carefully track and segment cell shapes over time, I plan to generate a next-generation four-color labeling system to mark, in a mosaic fashion cell membranes and/or nuclei of any given tissue. By combining this system with spectrally compatible GFP lines, labeling neighboring tissues or polarized hepatic proteins, I will analyze which specific cellular behaviors and tissue-tissue interactions control the three-dimensional organization of liver architecture.Preliminary results indicate that ubiquitous or restricted localization of transmembrane protein EphrinB1 is essential for progenitor cell motility and differentiation into mature hepatocytes. To assess whether differential EphrinB1 localization is associated with different molecular functions, I plan to analyze its role at different stages of liver morphogenesis. For this, I will generate conditional EphrinB1 mutant alleles, using CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering, and identify signaling targets and interactors by transcriptome and proteome analyses of isolated liver cells.

Besides intracellular killing, neutrophils are able to exert an antibacterial effect in the extracellular space by forming so-called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) containing released DNA and granule proteins. These represent an important antimicrobial function of neutrophils, as well as a phenomenon contributing to the perpetuation of inflammation. Despite its clear clinical relevance, little information is available regarding mechanisms underlying NET formation. There is an urgent need to dissect the molecular mechanism of NET formation, partly because of the intense debate about the origin of the released DNA in NETs and about a requirement for cell death for NET release, but more importantly because recent reports indicate the important role of mtDNA in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematous (SLE). Therefore, progress in finding drugs to minimize immunopathology in such autoimmune diseases depends on understanding these mechanisms.Hypothesis: Extracellular DNA trap formation is a programmed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) expulsion, which forms a DNA matrix associated with released granule proteins. The formation of NETs requires the active participation of molecules regulating mitochondrial dynamics and the cell cytoskeleton. We hypothesize that for NET formation cytoskeletal rearrangements such as actin polymerization and microtubule (MT) network formation are necessary for the directed transport of mitochondria and granules towards the plasma membrane. In addition, we have data indicating that mitochondrial dynamics, namely mitochondrial fusion, is essential for mtDNA release, underlining the active role of mitochondria during NET formation. Moreover, extracellular calcium influx is required for the formation of NETs, and we have identified a responsible calcium channel required for NET formation. Specific aims: We aim to better understand molecular mechanisms for mtDNA and granule protein release during extracellular DNA trap formation in neutrophils.AIM 1: Active participation of the cell cytoskeleton in NET formation will be studied using pharmacological and genetic approaches. Primary mouse neutrophils genetically deficient in actin polymerization, i.e. lacking the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) or Glutaredoxin 1 (Grx1) enzyme will be used to analyze the role of actin in NET formation. High-end microscopic techniques (3D-scanning electron microscopy) will be applied to envisage the details of DNA expulsion.AIM 2: Our shRNA-screening results have identified a mitochondrial fusion protein [optic atrophy-1 protein (Opa1)] as candidate gene directly responsible for MT network formation and mitochondrial mobilization leading to NET formation. Conditional knockout Opa1 (Opa1N?) mouse neutrophils as well as patients’ neutrophils deficient in functional Opa1 [autosomal dominant optic atrophy disease (ADOA)] will be used to dissect the mechanism of mtDNA release. To study the direct role of MT, we will apply the novel approach of in vivo conditional / inducible CRISPR/Cas9 tubulin knockout mice to delete specific microtubule genes up-regulated in mature activated neutrophils in an inducible and conditional manner. AIM 3: We have obtained evidence that the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel is present in neutrophils and is required for NET formation. Using BK-/- neutrophils, we plan to dissect the function of extracellular calcium flux and its role in temporal activation events in NET formation.Wider scientific context: mtDNA is now recognized as a key immune regulator. Autoantibodies against oxidized-mtDNA are detected in systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) patient' sera. A better understanding of the mechanisms of mtDNA release during neutrophil activation and NET formation will lead to new insight into its role under physiologic and pathologic condition, and provide molecular target (s) for improved anti-inflammatory therapy.

Changes in gene expression are the first immediate readout of genetic variants, and the dynamics, magnitude and variability of the changes are what leads to diversity in complex traits. Here we want to determine features (such as genomic distribution, effect size and location relative to the transcripts they influence) of genetic variants that affect dynamic gene expression after an environmental shift, and the mechanisms how they lead to differential dynamics. To this end we apply a combination of approaches: i) QTL mapping to identify genomic regions that enable faster adaptation to a new environment via differentially affecting transcript dynamics, ii) developing a computational framework for identifying molecular mechanisms that underlie these differential transcript dynamics and iii) exploit the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate single nucleotide exchanges for fine-mapping of causal alleles.

Our lack of knowledge on the functional consequences of the vast majority of genetic variation is one of the fundamental problems impeding such endeavors. While naturally occurring variants have the most relevance for explaining phenotypic diversity, systematic genome perturbations have primarily been focused on large-effect alleles, such as gene deletions. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping have addressed the role of natural variation in conditioning complex traits, but these approaches are limited by the haplotypes present in the population and are poorly equipped to detect interactions between loci - situations where the effect of one variant is masked or enhanced by another variant. It has become clear that a comprehensive view of genetic variation and its role in shaping phenotypes requires systematic perturbation of each variant in different genetic and environmental contexts. Recent advances in genome engineering now make such an approach possible. Here I propose to systematically engineer and phenotype naturally occurring single nucleotide variants and small insertion-deletion polymorphisms in three distinct Saccharomyces cerevisiae backgrounds. The strains will be constructed by a high-throughput CRISPR approach that allows creation of thousands of barcoded and sequence-verified variant strains simultaneously. I will profile strain pools in multiple environments, identifying those variants that modulate fitness in a given environment and genetic background by next-generation sequencing of genomically integrated DNA barcodes. To map pairwise and higher-order interactions I will then directly engineer variant combinations and assay their impact on cellular processes and fitness. The work in this proposal will be an important contribution towards understanding the phenotypic landscape governed by natural variants and their interaction with each other and the environment. Due to the conservation of fundamental cellular processes, the here identified principles underlying allelic interactions will allow valuable insights into the organizing principles of cellular systems. By enabling the interpretation of genetic variation in specific biological and environmental contexts these insights lay the foundation for efforts to predict the phenotype of a cell based on its genotype and environment alone.

Symmetrically divergent copy number variations of the 7q11.23 chromosomal region display symmetrically opposite phenotypes with regard to social facets of brain function. Hemizygous deletions cause WS, characterized by excessive friendliness, unreserved behavior around strangers, an engaging personality and striking verbal ability. Duplications of the region resemble autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with impaired social interactions and language deficits. Thus 7q11.23 represents the source of a cognitive axis that determines facets of human social behavior. Based on previous findings in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC derived neurons, we hypothesize that the WS deletion results in premature cell cycle exit and apoptosis of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) that lead to altered micro-circuitry as the brain develops. The basis for these disruptions has been attributed to haploinsufficiencies of BAZ1B, GTF2I or FZD9, three genes contained in the deleted region. We will seek additional evidence for developmental dysfunction related to these genes by RNAseq of cerebral organoids.(1) Generation and microscopic analysis of patient-derived cerebral organoids. We will generate iPSC derived brain organoids from WS patients, carriers of 7q11.23 duplication and control individuals. We will use clearing procedures (CLARITY) to define the developmental laminar organization by comparing cell content and thickness of ventricular zone and the outer subventricular zone. Relative abundances of cell types, numbers of apoptotic cells and the balance between proliferation and differentiation will be determined semiquantitatively by immunohistochemistry, pulse-chase experiments and FUCCI labeling to quantify phases of the cell cycle in the samples.(2) Single-cell RNAseq profiling of cerebral organoids. Drop-seq will be utilized to corroborate altered cell type abundances, and resolve transcriptional changes to the level of cell types in the developing brain. This will again test our hypothesis of incomplete differentiation, and reveal many novel transcripts relevant to WS and 7q11.23 duplication syndrome.As a future direction, we will determine the contribution of BAZ1B, GTF2I and FZD9 haploinsufficiencies to WS and 7q11.23 duplication syndrome. CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing will be used to generate heterozygous loss-of-function alleles for BAZ1B, GTF2I and FZD9 in control iPSCs. Cerebral organoids grown from these genetically engineered cells will be analyzed as described in (1) and (2) and the extent to which they recapitulate the WS neuro-phenotype will be determined. Together, the proposed experiments will provide a comprehensive picture of WS and 7q11.23 duplication syndrome that will link the known genetic defect to a cellular phenotype.

Association studies have been successful in determining over 100 genetic regions containing variants associated with RA risk. However, since the vast majority of these variants lie in non-coding regions of the genome, there has been limited success in finding disease-causing genes. The challenge now is to attach causal genes, variants, pathways and cell types to these association signals. Recent advances in molecular biology techniques, including genome editing and nuclear dynamic technologies have enabled the design of functional experiments to address these questions. We have developed an extensive molecular biology pipeline, involving chromosome conformation capture based technology (CHi-C), chromatin immunoprecipitation and genome editing technologies, that has already provided important insights into an RA associated region. Here we propose to extend our pipeline, to follow up interactions found in our CHi-C study between non-coding RA risk loci (CDK6, COG6/FOXO1, 16p13 and ARID5B/RTKN2) and their potential targets by, firstly, confirming causal genes using targeted chromosome conformation capture (3C) and gene expression. Secondly, prioritizing strongly correlated SNPs for functional studies using bioinformatics, and, finally, exploring their transcriptional regulatory activity using genotype-specific 3C and chromatin immunoprecipitation, coupled with genome editing technology such as CRISPR/Cas9.

SGPL1 is a key enzyme within the sphingolipid pathway and we aim to test the hypothesis that the disease manifests by perturbation of sphingolipid homeostasis, using patient studies and a CRISPR engineered SGPL1-knockout adrenal cell line. We will gather prospective clinical information using Research Electronic Data Capture on patients identified through genetic screening of cohorts with primary adrenal insufficiency and congenital nephrotic syndrome. For the first time we will interrogate the effect of harbouring rare variants/ copy number variants in SGPL1 in a cohort with developmental delay, with comparative analysis of phenotype and available MRI Brain. It is critical that we understand the sphingolipid signature of SGPL1 deficiency by plasma sphingolipid and sphingolipid pathway product profiling by LCMS. As a research tool, we will establish a fluorogenic lyase activity assay for use in patient white cells. In vitro, we will interrogate the sphingolipid and pathway product profile in a compartment specific manner following cellular fractionation. We will test whether steroidogenesis can be restored by chemically inhibiting de novo sphingolipid production and/or replacing the pathway product phosphatidylethanolamine, which has an established role in normal autophagy. Accordingly, we will assay expression of regulators of lysosomal biogenesis, the function of representative lysosomal enzymes and expression of autophagy markers. Finally, beyond the study of adrenal disease, we will establish a consortium of experts to develop future studies of the disease mechanisms in this multi-systemic disorder and identify therapeutic targets.

However, while much progress has been made in uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying fitness-related traits, mainly by studying large-effect mutants in model organisms, little is known about naturally occurring genetic variants that affect these traits. The central aim of my current SNSF Professorship grant is to identify naturally occurring polymorphisms that underlie evolutionary changes in life history, using Drosophila melanogaster as a model. Over the last 33 months, we have used two complementary approaches to tackle this problem: to generate 'catalogs' of candidate variants we have applied whole-genome Pool-sequencing to (1) North American populations clinally differentiated for life history and (2) a >30-year-long artificial selection experiment for longevity. Both approaches are 'designed' to maximize among-population life-history differentiation and thus to increase our ability to map life-history variants via sequencing. In a second step, we have begun to perform experiments to examine the life-history effects of some of these candidate mechanisms. Based on our genomic analyses, we have prioritized three candidate mechanisms for experiments: (1) for the cline, we have identified clinal SNP polymorphisms in several genes involved in insulin signaling, a pathway known from molecular studies to regulate life-history physiology, including a clinal 2-SNP polymorphism in the transcription factor gene foxo; (2) a clinal chromosomal inversion polymorphism, In(3R)Payne, to which 79% of the most strongly clinal SNPs in the genome map; and (3), in the selection experiment, we have found strong enrichment of immunity genes among our top candidates. To date, our experiments show that (1) the foxo polymorphism has major pleiotropic on egg-to-adult survival, body size and starvation resistance, in assays based on synthetic recombinant inbred lines; (2) the In(3R)Payne polymorphism is maintained by clinal selection, independent of neutrality and admixture, and affects body size, a strongly clinal trait; and (3) the long-lived selection lines survive pathogenic infections much better than the controls. In this application for a 2-year extension of my grant, we propose to follow up on these promising leads. First, to better understand how the foxo polymorphism affects life history, we will use homologous replacement of the 2 SNPs (and their allelic combinations) into a common background via CRISPR/Cas9, in collaboration with Alistair McGregor (Oxford); we will measure additive and epistatic effects of these constructs on life history and FOXO activity. Second, to identify targets of selection within In(3R)Payne, we will phase-sequence isochromosomal lines and apply ABC-based coalescent models to the data, in collaboration with Mark Kirkpatrick (Austin). In addition, we will perform RNA-seq of standard vs. inverted lines to uncover transcriptional differences between inversion karyotypes. Finally, to begin to uncover the regulatory details of the intriguing but poorly understood connection between lifespan and immunity in the longevity selection lines, we will assay transcriptional responses to infection in selection versus control lines, both in young and old flies, and - secondly - test whether silencing immune genes via transgenic RNAi affects lifespan, as hypothesized. Together, this integrative approach - spanning population genomics, functional genetics, and physiology - will significantly advance our understanding of the molecular basis of adaptive changes in life history and aging, a fundamental but largely unresolved problem in evolutionary biology.

We will investigate microbicidal mechanisms and host responses in macrophages and neutrophils in response to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus and validate key findings with antimicrobial resistant bacteria. Automated genetic screens (e.g. CRISPR) will be performed in macrophages to identify microbicidal mechanisms. A reverse phase proteomic array (RPPA) of core neutrophil transduction responses to bacteria will be followed by screening the effects of pathway inhibition on bacterial killing and regulation of inflammation. Screen 'hits' will be supplemented with candidate regulators we have already identified. Mechanisms will be validated in phagocytes and in genetically modified mice and zebrafish models of infection. Compound libraries will be screened in phagocytes and zebrafish to enhance microbicidal responses that maximize bacterial clearance and minimise inflammation. After lead optimization we will confirm efficacy using super-resolution microscopy and mouse models of bacterial infection. Animal adapted strains of bacteria will be serially passaged in human phagocytes to identify bacterial mutations arising from selective pressure. Analysis of how mutations influence microbicidal function will further clarify mechanisms and we will explore if mutational 'hot-spots' can be neutralized with monoclonal antibodies to limit immune escape. The physiological relevance of selected mechanisms and pharmacological 'hits' will be confirmed in primary tissue macrophages and neutrophils isolated from inflamed tissue in healthy adults and patients at risk of bacterial infection. We will use molecular optical imaging with SmartProbes to document key phagocyte microbicidal responses to bacteria in the alveolar space. We will also use this platform to perform initial micro-dosing of lead compounds and expedite delivery of future phase I trials.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	2874141.0	GBP

Despite the increasing incidence of CNS metastasis, there lack of translational research focus in BCLM. In addition, diagnosis using current methods is challenging. Overall the project aims to improve scientific understanding and develop a diagnostic biomarker by using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Methods Clinical samples will be obtained from patients with BCLM and will comprise cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood and primary tumour tissue; all accessed through currently active studies through the Royal Marsden and South East London Cancer Research Network (SELCRN). 1. Genomic analysis DNA will be extracted from CSF tumour cells and/or from the CSF supernatant. DNA will undergo whole exome sequencing, and will be compared, within the same individual, to germline, primary tumour and other metastatic site DNA, and also to existing breast cancer sequencing datasets to identify recurrent or unique somatic genomic aberrations in BCLM. 2. Functional genomics Genomic aberrations will be investigated for functional consequences through the establishment of an in vivo model. Established human tumour cell lines will be manipulated by transfection via lentiviral expression constructs, and gene knockdown by RNA and CRISPR interference. 3. Biomarker discovery Levels of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) in CSF will be determined by digital droplet (ddPCR) in patients being investigated for BCLM, in parallel with standard cytological analysis. Serial CSF samples will be analysed for ctDNA dynamics to correlate this with other parameters of disease status, including the clinical decision to stop ineffective treatments. Through the scientific methods used and findings generated, this research will impact not only breast, but other cancer types, in addition to other neurological conditions.

GLUT4 traffics through multiple compartments to reach specialised storage vesicles (GSV) from where it can be recruited to the plasma membrane upon insulin stimulation. Trafficking events involving sorting GLUT4 and other cargo proteins from a late endosomal compartment back into the recycling pool are essential for the formation of the GSV. Retromer and the newly discovered retriever complexes play a role in late-endosomal sorting. In this study, we propose to explore the potential role of the retriever complex in GSV formation. We have generated clonal knockout 3T3-L1 cell lines, using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, lacking Vps29 (common to both retromer and retriever complexes), Vps35 (unique to retromer) and Vps35L/C16orf62 (unique to retriever). We have confirmed the knockout status of the clones, performed some preliminary analysis and will further characterise them to determine phenotype in the absence of these proteins. Using a range of cell-biology and biochemistry techniques, we will determine for the first time whether the retriever complex affects GLUT4 sorting to GSVs and its translocation to the plasma membrane in response to insulin stimulation and facilitate glucose uptake.

Triple A syndrome (AAAS), a rare disorder, presents with tissue-specific degeneration. Encoded by the AAAS gene, ALADIN is a nuclear pore complex (NPC) protein necessary for nuclear import of DNA protective molecules and is important for redox homeostasis. ALADIN's role is not fully characterised: its discovery at the centrosome and the endoplasmic reticulum suggests a role outside the NPC. Mitochondrial dysfunction may be implicated by disruption of mitochondrial steroidogenic enzymes, enlarged mitochondrial mass and increased mitochondrial superoxide species. My preliminary data shows ALADIN localisation to mitochondria in SHSY5Y cells. Investigation of AAAS is marred by suboptimal models. In collaboration, I have generated novel induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models of disease using CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing: 1) Homozygous knock out (AAAS-KO) and 2) Homozygous hotspot mutation (AAAS-mutant). The unedited iPSC will serve as an isogenic control. Aim: To differentiate the AAAS-iPSC and controls towards adrenal-like and neuronal phenotypes, for use in: 1. OS profiling of AAAS, including mitochondrial phenotyping. 2. Identification of gene expression in AAAS, signposting ALADIN's non-canonical functions. Method Differentiation: Through established in-house pipelines. OS profiling: Susceptibility to OS/bioenergetic response in the AAAS-mutant, AAAS-KO and control cells will be assessed by XFe96 extracellular flux analyser. If mitochondrial dysfunction is confirmed, mitochondrial phenotyping will ensue. RNA Seq: AAAS-KO neurons (clones, n=10) and controls (clones, n=10) will be sent for RNA seq. Bioinformatics will be performed with in-house expertise. Recapitulation in adrenal cells will identify pathways common to both tissues. Functional experiments will target genes/pathways of interest to reverse the AAAS phenotype. Impact: Insight into the pathogenesis of AAAS has therapeutic development potential for AAAS/degenerative diseases.	Medical Research Council	Fellowship	180088.0	GBP

However, many bacteria harbor secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters (BGCs) that are not expressed under laboratory conditions, and thus their products cannot be purified and characterized. Synthetic biology is a new scientific discipline that applies engineering principles to biological systems with the aim of improving them or building novel ones. Synthetic biology approaches can be used to re-engineer (refactor) silent biosynthetic genes in such a way, that they can be expressed in heterologous hosts, leading to production of previously undiscovered secondary metabolites. Research question and objectives: SynBioBac project intends to address the challenge of “waking” silent biosynthetic genes in bacteria by using synthetic biology principles and tools. Correspondingly, the objectives include cloning of selected BGCs, their disassembly and refactoring with new regulatory elements, development of tools for activation of gene expression and sensing of produced secondary metabolites, expression of refactored BGCs in several heterologous bacterial hosts, followed by purification and characterization of novel secondary metabolites. Methods: Construction of representative gene libraries followed by screening; assembly of complete BGCs in yeast (transformation-associated recombination); BGCs disassembly using a combination of PCR and restriction digests; refactoring in yeast with new regulatory elements with help of CRISPR/Cas system; construction of activator and biosensor devices; expression in pre-engineered bacterial hosts; identification of metabolites with high-resolution mass spectrometry; purification and structure elucidation with NMR; testing for biological activities. Level of originality: The project goes well beyond current state-of-the-art, since it develops and tests an original synthetic biology-based approach to “waking” silent bacterial genes for biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. It is intended to provide a roadmap for drug discovery that can be applied to virtually any bacterial species, and may in itself discover novel bioactive natural products with applied potential.

Leishmaniasis causes significant tissue destruction and disfigurement and can be life-threatening. The disease is spread by infected sand flies and through infected animals, mainly dogs. There are multiple forms of the disease, but the most life-threatening is visceral leishmaniasis (VL), which is the second most fatal parasitic infection after malaria. No vaccine exists for this tropical disease in humans. However, patients who recover from leishmaniasis develop immunity against reinfection, indicating that a vaccine is feasible. An international research team, led by Dr. Abhay Satoskar at Ohio State University, has generated genetically modified live weakened Leishmania parasites as a vaccine for VL. These parasites are being produced under current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) by the team's industry partner. Preclinical studies show that these weakened parasites are safe and immunization induces protective immunity against infection. The team will test the safety and effectiveness of weakened Leishmania parasites as a vaccine using a novel canine model of VL, in which dogs develop VL following natural exposure to bites of infected wild sand flies in regions of Tunisia with high incidence of VL infection. With over 2 million new leishmaniasis cases annually worldwide, this study could represent a major step forward for the development of a human vaccine for VL, as well as a vaccine for dogs to reduce their risk as a carrier, having a major and far-reaching positive impact on global health."

These disorders are incurable and their underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Intriguingly, varying symptom severity has been described in patients with the same causative mutations for a number of these disorders and phenotypes displayed in some mouse models are strain-dependent. To search for secondary mutations that suppress phenotypes in mouse models of the neurological disorder, Rett syndrome, Monica Justice’s lab performed a genome-wide screen by inducing random mutations with the chemical mutagen ENU. I aim to take advantage of recent advances in CRISPR/Cas9 technology to develop a CRISPR-based screening method. This method will simplify isolation of modifying mutations, greatly reduce the number of animals required and can be adapted for recessive screening. I will use this method to screen for suppressors of two neurological disorders that are predicted to be modifiable: ATR-X and ADNP syndromes. Both causative genes encode epigenetic proteins: ATRX is a chromatin remodelling ATPase and ADNP is a putative transcription factor. I hope that the ‘hits’ obtained in these screens will help us to better understand ATRX/ADNP protein function and open up therapeutic avenues for patients.

Amongst these, the amino acid transporter SNAT1 was downregulated by the HIV accessory protein Vpu, and the putative serine carriers SERINC3/5 were downregulated by Nef. I identified alanine as an endogenous SNAT1 substrate, and showed that uptake of alanine is essential for T-cell mitogenesis. I also saw Nef- and Vpu-independent regulation of numerous other transmembrane transporters, suggesting a general paradigm for HIV-mediated manipulation of nutrient uptake and cellular metabolism. I now wish to (1) characterise the roles of alanine and SERINC3/5 in T-cell amino acid metabolism; (2) discover new metabolic pathways targeted by HIV in T-cells; and (3) identify key amino acid transporters and metabolic pathways required for T-cell mitogenesis. Along with alanine transport by SNAT1, ER-resident SERINC proteins incorporate serine into membrane phospholipids. In the 1st part of my project, I will therefore use radiolabelled amino acid transport and stable isotope-labelled metabolite tracing techniques to elucidate the role of alanine in T-cell metabolism, and determine whether cell surface SERINC3/5 act as T-cell amino acid incorporators or transporters. In the 2nd part of my project, I will use Antibody-Free Magnetic Cell Sorting (AFMACS) to isolate HIV-infected T-cells, apply a comprehensive, unbiased metabolomic approach to identify dysregulated metabolic pathways, and determine the mechanisms and viral genes responsible. Finally, in the 3rd part of my project, I will develop a combined plasma membrane proteomic and CRISPR-based genetic screening strategy to determine which transmembrane transporters and metabolic pathways are required for T-cell mitogenesis, focussing on mechanisms for glutamine and net amino acid uptake.

The first project stems from our current work on the CRISPR pathway, a recently discovered RNA-guided adaptive defense mechanism in bacteria and archaea that silences mobile genetic elements such as viruses (bacteriophages) and plasmids. CRISPR systems rely on short RNAs (crRNAs) that associate with CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins and function as sequence-specific guides in the detection and destruction of invading nucleic acids. To obtain molecular insights into the mechanisms of crRNA-guided interference, we will pursue structural and functional studies of DNA-targeting ribonuceoprotein complexes from type II and III CRISPR systems. Our work will shed light on the function of these systems in microbial pathogenesis and provide a framework for the informed engineering of RNA-guided gene targeting technologies. The second proposed research direction centres on RNA-targeting antiviral strategies employed by the human innate immune system. Here, our work will focus on structural studies of major interferon-induced effector proteins, examining the allosteric activation mechanism of RNase L and the mechanism of the IFIT protein complex that specifically targets 5'-termini of viral RNAs. In our investigations, we plan to approach these questions using an integrated strategy combining structural biology, biochemistry and biophysics with cell-based functional studies. Together, our studies will provide fundamental molecular insights into RNA-centred antiviral mechanisms and their impact on human health and disease.

Characterization of the molecular mechanisms regulating CSC function is crucial to develop CSC-targeted therapies. Yet, due to the difficulty of isolating pure CSC populations and manipulating them ex vivo, our understanding of their biological properties is still limited. We have recently overcome these limitations by developing a method for the generation of human cells with functional hallmarks of CSCs through oncogenic reprogramming of somatic cells in vitro. Being controlled and amenable to experimental manipulation, this system represents a unique tool to study CSC biology. We will use in vitro-generated CSCs to perform CRISPR/Cas-based loss-of-function screens, with the aim of discovering novel mechanisms important for CSC formation and function. This study has the potential to identify novel biomarkers and new molecular targets for cancer therapies. Aims and Methods 1. Generation of a fluorescent CSC reporter. In order to monitor the phenotype of tumorigenic CSCs in living, unstained cells, we will generate a dual-color CSC fluorescent reporter, taking advantage of genes which are strongly up- or down-regulated in in vitro-generated CSCs and correlate with tumorigenic potential. 2. Primary screening. CSCs or partially-reprogrammed precursor cell lines expressing the fluorescent reporters will be used in two distinct CRISPR/Cas loss-of-function screens using available pooled gRNA libraries. In the first screen we will use the partially reprogrammed cells and screen for gRNAs which promote CSC appearance, to identify tumor suppressors. In the second screen, we will use the CSCs and screen for gRNAs which inhibit their tumorigenicity, to discover novel therapeutic targets. 3. Hit validation. To rule out off-target effects, primary hits will be validated using distinct gRNAs, and by performing rescue experiments. As a final read–out, in vivo xenograft assays will be used to assess cell tumor-initiating ability. How the results of this research will be used Based on preliminary results, we expect to identify numerous proteins affecting CSC formation and function. Priority for validation in clinically-derived CSCs will be assigned based on various criteria: correlation between gene expression profiles and clinical outcome using publicly available datasets, existence of reported mutations, single cell analysis on tumor sections, target druggability and availability of tool compounds. Follow-up drug screening will be performed using the same experimental system and read-outs. The prognostic value of the identified hits will also be analyzed.

Our preliminary data shows that ISGylation is critical for regulating our innate immune response to infection and that distinct (E3 ligase-specific) modification pathways are necessary. Our objectives are to i) identify what E3 ligase and which ISGylated protein(s) are required for a regulated antiviral response using a combination of CRISPR/Cas-edited cell lines and proteomics and ii) characterise the antiviral response when ISGylation is compromised (quantitative proteomics). Viral infections trigger a profound cellular response that comprises the induction of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) aimed at limiting the infection. Many ISGs target the infection, while others coordinate the cellular response and a dysregulated response is pathogenic, thus its tight control is critical. Inherited ISG15-deficiency was recently identified in patients with autoinflammatory interferonopathies and typically these patients exhibited elevated ISG expression in the absence of infection. Hence, the interferon-inducible, ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 was identified as a new regulator of the antiviral response. ISG15 can functions as a 'free' molecule or as a posttranslational modification (ISGylation). We have generated ISG15-deficient cells and confirmed the dysregulated expression of ISGs, recapitulating what is observed in patient cells. Importantly, only when we reconstitute the ability of these cells to posttranslationally ISGylate proteins is this response controlled. Additionally, this control was independent of the HERC5-ligase, suggesting that alternative E3 ligases, and specific ISGylated protein(s), are necessary for a regulated antiviral response. Together, our research programme brings a new dimension to our understanding of innate immune regulation and to ubiquitin-like protein biology as a whole.

Although there is steady progress in resolving the functions of unknown genes, the identities of most secondary metabolites in poplar remain unknown. The lack of metabolite identities in experimental systems is a true gap in information content, and impedes obtaining deep insight into the complex biology of living systems. The main reason is that metabolites are difficult to purify because of their low abundance, hindering their structural characterization and the discovery of their biosynthetic pathways. In this project, we will use CSPP, an innovative method recently developed in my lab, to systematically predict the structures of metabolites along with their biosynthetic pathways in poplar wood, bark and leaves. This CSPP method is based on a combination of metabolomics and informatics. In a next step, the CSPP tool will be combined with two complementary genetic approaches based on re-sequence data from 750 poplar trees to identify the genes encoding the enzymes in the predicted pathways. Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) will be made to identify SNPs in the genes involved in the metabolic conversions. Subsequently, rare defective alleles will be identified for these genes in the sequenced population. Genes identified by both approaches will then be further studied either by crossing natural poplars that are heterozygous for the defective alleles, or by CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing in poplar. The functional studies will be further underpinned by enzyme assays. Given our scarce knowledge on the structure of most secondary metabolites and their metabolic pathways in poplar, this large-scale identification effort will lay the foundation for systems biology research in this species, and will shape opportunities to further develop poplar as an industrial wood-producing crop.

230	Dr. Cornelia VESELY	Medical University of Vienna	None	2019-08-05	2022-08-04	Adjusting the base: (Epi)transcriptomic RNA modification in inflammation & host-microbiome crosstalk	The recognition of widespread and diverse RNA modifications and their influence on genetic information has sparked epitranscriptomic research with impact on biology and medicine. The most abundant modification known is RNA-editing by adenine to inosine deamination, found in all classes of RNAs but rRNAs. Editing is essential, as deletions of the responsible deaminases ADAR1 or ADAR2 are lethal in mice. Mutations in ADAR1 cause aberrant sensing of self-RNAs leading to the autoinflammatory Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. Inosines are interpreted as guanosines. Thus, editing can recode mRNAs or retarget microRNAs. For instance, the mRNAs encoding Filamin-a (FLNA) and Filamin-b (FLNB) undergo a glutamine to arginine recoding in their C-termini. FLNA editing levels vary across tissues, reaching almost 90% in the gut. Besides a link to smooth muscle cell contraction consequences of FLNA editing are largely unknown. Our preliminary data show that RNA-editing ameliorates inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colon cancer. In the gut host and microbiota constantly communicate, partially by secreted microRNAs but also by RNA modifications. Thus, RNA-modifications will regulate and affect the host-fecal microbiota crosstalk also impacting IBD. We could already demonstrate an altered microbiome in FLNA editing deficient mice. Organism-wide RNA-editing can suppress inflammation by inhibiting the RNA sensor MDA5. Potentially, also other MDA5 related helicases are involved in modification-dependent protection from hyperinflammation. Here, we aim to study the role of FLNA mRNA editing in IBD and cancer and the impact of microRNA editing and modifications on the host-microbiota crosstalk. Lastly, the role of helicases in discriminating self vs. non-self RNA will be investigated. Results will advance the field of epitranscriptomic research and potentially serve as a basis to diagnose or treat IBD and colon cancer. The questions will be addressed using a wide spectrum of methods. State-of-the-art mouse models of IBD and cancer will be combined with microbiota analysis in rescued ADAR knockout mice and mice expressing constitutively edited/unedited FLNA. Transcriptomics will identify key edited or overexpressed microRNAs, which will be further explored by generating mice with inducible, tissue-specific editing by CRISPR/Cas9, a completely novel approach. Finally, the involvement of RNA helicases in the ADAR1-MDA5 axis will be explored by an innovative CRISPR screen. The involved researchers have highly complementary expertise. CV will focus on transcriptomics and RNA-editing molecular biology, FP is a microbiologist specialized in microbiota research, FE is an experienced immunologist and KC, a co-inventor of CRISPR/Cas9, will focus on genome engineering of cutting edge mouse models. Each aspect of the project stands on its own and will enable researchers to significantly consolidate their career and independence.

Defects are categorized primarily into three groups: developmental defects with a reduced number of beta cells, disruption of beta cell function or a progressive destruction of beta cells, mostly by defects in key regulators of autoimmunity. With the support of the SNF (Interdisciplinary grant CR33I3_140655) we have built a Swiss and international cohort of over 400 diabetic subjects, who are all genetically characterized (targeted next generation sequences, whole exome in selected cases). The approach by next generation sequencing yielded a high diagnostic rate of monogenic diabetes (MD) in 28% of the subjects, where we identi-fied known mutations and novel variants in the so called MODY genes (HNF4A, GCK, HNF1A, PDX1, HNF1B, NEUROD1, KLF11, CEL, PAX4, INS, BLK, ABCC8, KCNJ11). Confirming our ini-tial hypothesis that mutations in all genes controlling pancreas development and beta cell function could cause MD, we identified variants in additional 23% of the subjects of our cohort in 88 different genes (including KIAA2022). Based on these encouraging results we now propose the following hy-pothesis and related aims:PROJECT RATIONALE: In addition to the previous rational, we now extend our hypothesis to regulatory elements in noncod-ing regions contribute to the complex human diabetes phenotype in our cohort. We therefore propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: To investigate the unidentified families with a high probability of MD by whole genome sequencing, assess allele specific expression (ASE) and search for modifiers by RNA-Sequencing in the whole cohort. We will follow up on our cohort built with the previous grant and use cutting edge human genetics such as whole genome sequencing and RNA-Sequencing to investigate the complex mechanisms of diabetes. Aim 2: To functionally analyze newly identified genes involved in MD in vitro and in vivo by gen-erating a knockout mouse using the CRISPR-Cas9 technique.EXPECTED VALUE: We believe that our hypothesis is most efficiently tested with an interdisci-plinary approach, combining clinical endocrinology, human genetics and cell biology. Our results will help improve our understanding of the genetics and pathophysiology of underlying diabetes. If successful, we will not only extend the list of genes and noncoding regions causing MD but also provide insight into the physiology in human beta cell function. These results may help to identify novel targets to efficiently treat MD to prevent long-term complications in affected children. Moreover, the mechanistic insight may also serve to expand the therapeutic approaches to polygenic forms of diabetes. As proof of principle the results collected during the last funding period have led to critical adjustments of treatment for those participants who were initially misdiagnosed, improving their quality of life and hopefully prevention of long-term complications.

Infektionskrankheiten und Pathologie Universität Bern	2017-09-01	2021-08-31	Host innate immune responses to viral RNA	'Host innate immune responses to viral RNA'Background: Coronaviruses (CoVs) are RNA viruses that have long been known to cause severe disease in livestock and companion animals. In humans, severe and fatal respiratory diseases have been observed through the emergence of zoonotic CoVs, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. CoVs are well known to efficiently evade early innate immune responses and enzymatic functions within - and virus-host interactions at - the CoV replication/transcription complex (RTC) are key to efficiently evade early innate immune responses. Working hypothesis and aims: We hypothesize that induction of early innate immune responses to CoV heavily rely on the ability of host cell innate immune sensors to access and recognize viral RNA and that CoVs have evolved efficacious mechanisms to prevent early detection of viral RNA. We further hypothesize that these early virus-host interactions predominantly take place at the CoV RTC. In order to mechanistically understand these innate immune evasion strategies, we will “illuminate” the cellular environment of the CoV RTC to identify host cell factors that are required for CoV replication, and host cell factors that are targeting the CoV RTC to restrict CoV replication. The reverse genetic systems for the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and well characterized recombinant mutant viruses will be used in combination with murine and human models of infection to dissect key steps and key molecules involved in early innate immune responses on the molecular level. We will furthermore employ state-of-the-art technologies involving biotin ligase-mediated proximity labeling and proteomics, CRISPR/Cas9-based functional screens, and transcriptomics in combination with ribosomal profiling to obtain a detailed mechanistic view on (i) key interactions involved in early innate immune responses, (ii) the kinetics of these interactions and (iii) the kinetics of the global host cell response under well-defined conditions. These studies will provide spatial and temporal view of basic principles of viral RNA recognition and antiviral innate immune mechanisms in different primary cell types following virus infection. Expected significance: Our proposed studies will reveal basic principles of viral RNA sensing and antiviral innate immune effector mechanisms that are highly relevant also beyond CoV infections. We expect to identify key molecules, mechanisms and pathways that promote or restrict viral replication at the site of viral RNA synthesis. This information will further our understanding on fundamental aspects of viral RNA synthesis and innate immune responses to RNA virus infection, and will facilitate the development of novel strategies to interfere with viral RNA replication during the early phase of infections.

Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignancy in women, with an incidence of one in eight being affected within their lifetime. This emphasizes the need to improve breast cancer prevention and treatment. Breast carcinomas are divided into several clinical subtypes. Among these is invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), which is characterized by neoplastic mammary cells invading the surrounding stroma in a dispersed, discohesive growth pattern. This phenotype is based on dysfunctional cell-cell adhesion, primarily driven by lack of E-cadherin (CDH1) protein expression. Consequently, most ILCs display loss-of-function alterations of the CDH1 locus. Although several recurrent genetic alterations have been identified in human ILC, only a few of these genes have been functionally studied in mice in the context of Cdh1 loss. Hence, more systematic approaches are required to functionally and comprehensively decipher the molecular processes of ILC initiation and metastatic progression.Prof. Jonkers’ laboratory at the Netherlands Cancer Institute - Antoni van Leeuwenhoek hospital (NKI- AVL), has demonstrated considerable expertise in modeling breast cancer using 3D organotypic cultures and diverse genetically engineered mouse models. Moreover, a recently introduced culture method has enabled 2D in vitro propagation of primary murine mammary epithelial cells (MMECs). To this end, MMEC cultures derived from wild-type or Cdh1-floxed mice will serve as platform to conduct CRISPR/Cas9-based, genome-wide screening approaches. Candidate genes promoting MMEC proliferation in conjunction with Cdh1 loss will be further evaluated in a rapid, non-germline CRISPR/Cas9-dependent mouse model of ILC. Of note, the MMEC culture system will also be instrumental to expand and functionally study human primary cells derived from ILCs and corresponding precursor-type lesions. This will complement the data arising from murine ILC-modeling, thus ultimately unraveling novel drivers of human ILC. Taken together, these findings will deepen the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of ILC and may have substantial translational impact on breast cancer prognosis and therapy.

Samples will be processed immediately for epithelial cell purification using magnetic bead sorting and generation of intestinal organoids according to established protocols. DNA and RNA will be extracted simultaneously. NLRC5 promoter DNA methylation analyses will be performed using bisulfite pyrosequencing and expression of NLRC5 as well as MHC-I related genes tested using RT-PCR and western blotting. Exposure of organoids to IFN-gamma will determine the impact of DNA methylation on the inducibility of MHC-I signaling. Locus specific, targeted de-methylation will be performed using a CRISPR/Cas9 based method and correlation between DNA methylation and clinical phenotype investigated using various computational approaches. Objective 2: We will generate NLRC5 knock-out and over-expressing human gut organoids using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and piggyBac transposon-based vector system respectively. Organoids from healthy individuals obtained from 2 gut segments will be modified and co-cultured with IFN-gamma. Following, we will perform genome wide expression (RNAseq) and proteomic Tandem Mass Tag profiling on organoids. Generated data will be analysed using novel computational methods such as diffusion-based approaches, which will allow identification of NLRC5 and/or IFN-gamma dependant signalling pathways operative in the human intestinal epithelium. Objective 3: In order to assess the functional impact of NLRC5 expression and MHC-I signaling on the intestinal epithelium in health and CD we will test intestinal epithelial barrier by measuring Transepithelial Electrical Resistance and efflux of FITC-dextran across organoids grown as monolayers. Additionally, we will test innate host response to viral infections and co-culture blood derived CD8+ T-cells with gut organoids and study their interaction using two-photon microscopy.

Leishmania have a single flagellum required for motility and attachment of promastigote forms in the insect vector. Surprisingly, promastigotes are viable in culture even if they build no flagellum, yet intracellular amastigote forms, whose short flagellum was long considered non-functional, cannot survive in macrophages if protein trafficking to the flagellar membrane is disrupted. This points to a role for the flagellum in infection. We previously showed that the short amastigote flagellum structurally resembles sensory cilia and observed that the flagellum tip forms a junction with the parastiophorous vacuole membrane. Cilia and flagella are organelles found on diverse cell types, from protists to cells in the human body, acting as motile appendages or antenna-like signal transducers and we hypothesise that the flagellum of intracellular Leishmania is a sensory organelle. The flagellum is a complex organelle composed of hundreds of proteins. We have developed a new method for rapid generation of gene knockouts (KO) using CRISPR-Cas9 tools which enable us for the first time to conduct a systematic KO screen to test which types of flagellar mutants (cytoskeletal, membrane, tip defects) lose the ability to infect macrophages. We will also use biochemical methods to discover new proteins localized to the flagellum for inclusion in the KO screen. Mutants that fail to survive in macrophages will be subjected to detailed phenotype analysis. This research will uncover new information about the role of the Leishmania flagellum in infection and test the hypothesis that a physical connection between flagellum tip and host cell contributes to virulence. We will use pluripotent stem cell-derived human macrophages as in vitro infection models which allow us to dissect molecular mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions with relevance to human disease.

Knockdown (KD) of identified transcripts through dsRNA injection and the phenotypes after exposure to a panel of insecticides will determine whether the candidate is involved in insecticide resistance and hence carried forward to characterisation. If the candidate transcript is hypothesised to be part of a pathway, KD of pathway partners and qPCR on these for each of the KDs will be used to verify the pathway. Once the upstream candidate is identified microarray experiments comparing the KD mosquitoes with GFP-injected controls will identify larger-scale changes. Characterisation of the transcript will depend upon its hypothesised function. To identify these putative functions, a variety of resources are available, including literature trawling, enrichment analysis and homology-based methods. An array of techniques can be employed to determine the function of the candidate including insecticide binding assays, behavioural assays, localisation studies, proteomics, structural resolving, up-regulation through transgenic lines and complete knock out via CRISPR. Population genetics tools and heritability analysis can then be employed to determine whether there is scope and value to use the transcript as an in-field diagnostic. By identifying SNPs or other variable genetic regions in-field resistance diagnostics via PCR, or restriction digest PCR can be developed. A further output from this fellowship will be to inform industry partners such as IVCC of potential candidate targets for new insecticides. To this end, Plasmodium falciparum competence of the mosquito will be assessed to ensure that disruption of the transcript will not affect this in a significant way.

Characterisation of small molecules and hepatokines involved in this communication is critical to understand the molecular mechanisms leading to insulin resistance, the decline in ?-cell function, inflammation and cardiovascular complications associated with Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. However, the complexity of these metabolic diseases, that involve interactions between tissues such as the liver, adipose tissue, immune system and brain, the action of hormones and the network of signalling pathways linked to insulin, such as mTORC or the stress-activated cJUN N-terminal Kinase (JNK), has been difficult to decipher. JNK pathway is activated by consuming a high fat diet, and preventing this activation by tissue-specific ablation of JNK in mouse models inhibits the development of obesity, inflammation and insulin resistance. Therefore, JNK is critical in the crosstalk between metabolic organs and the immune response in the course of metabolic disorders, although its downstream effectors are largely unknown. We use mice with genetic and pharmacological inactivation of JNK in hepatocytes, Tandem Mass Tag (TMT-MS) proteomics and Next Generation Sequencing (RNAseq) as a viable strategy to identify new hepatokines involved in metabolic regulation. Using a TMT-MS screening we identified a group of JNK-regulated hepatokines, including proteins involved in immune response such as complement proteins or previously characterised metabolic regulators (such as RBP4), confirming the potential of this approach to identify metabolic regulators. In addition, we identified other secreted proteins without a known role in metabolic regulation. We aim to characterise interesting candidates identified in this approach. We will use adeno-associated viral vectors, CRISPR/CAS9-based systems and mouse models of obesity and insulin resistance to study the role of these hepatokines in the multi-organ crosstalk and metabolic regulation. The short-term goal of this proposal is to identify and characterise JNK-regulated hepatokines that may be involved in diet-induced inflammation and insulin resistance. The long-term goal of this proposal is to characterise novel mediators of the communication between organ systems that may be involved in diet-induced metabolic dysfunction, to uncover new diagnostic and therapeutic targets in metabolic pathologies.

Such mechanisms have mostly been described in basidiomycetous brown rot and white rot fungi, but are largely unknown in non-ligninolytic Ascomycota. Clonostachys rosea (Hypocreales, Ascomycota) is a filamentous with a broad range of ecological specializations from plant associations, saprotrophy to biotrophy and parasitism on nematodes and other fungi. Upon sequencing of C. rosea genomes, the gene family encoding GMC oxidoreductases classified as auxiliary activity family 3 (CAZy classification), specifically subfamily AA3_2 (aryl alcohol and glucose oxidases), was found to be significantly expanded. On the other hand, the genomes of the saprotrophs Neurospora crassa and Trichoderma reesei as well as the mycoparasites Trichoderma atroviride and Trichoderma virens (ecologically very similar to C. rosea) showed a significantly reduced AA3 gene content, suggesting that such enzymes are not essential for these nutritional strategies, and were either not acquired or lost by selective adaptation. This poses the question about the function of this many C. rosea paralogs, as this fungus is neither a prominent lignocellulose decomposer nor a plant pathogen, that would demand such an arsenal of genes for (ligno)cellulose degradation. The aim of this study is to elucidate the functionality and role of C. rosea GMC oxidoreductases, and identify the nutritional strategies they are involved in. Our research plan includes a transcriptional study of GMC oxidoreductases that are significantly regulated under the C. rosea major nutritional conditions, an investigation of the functional significance of GMC oxidoreductases in C. rosea (including single/multiple inactivation of genes using state-of-the-art CRISPR/Cas9 engineering tools) and biochemical characterization of selected GMC oxidoreductases that encode functional enzymes. Our large-scale approach will provide important insights in the regulation of gene families supporting different life-styles in C. rosea and highlight complex mechanisms of mycoparasitism and fungus-plant interactions.

Identification of new driver pathways is critical to develop credible personalised treatments. PTEN suppresses the oncogenic PI3K pathway and regulates homologous recombination (HR) and consequently its loss can be targeted by inhibitors of the PI3K and DNA repair pathways. I have recently identified that PTEN loss or downregulation is common in HGSOC (present in 281 of 447 cases), occurs mainly by copy number alterations (CNA), is associated with worse prognosis and offers possibilities for personalized therapy. My hypothesis is that the effects of PTEN activity in HGSOC are dose-dependent and expression levels and cellular localization of PTEN determine functional differences. I aim to 1) model the functional effects of PTEN haploinsufficiency or loss in tumour cell lines; 2) test small molecule inhibitors from Astrazeneca in combinations targeting PI3K pathway and HR. In aim 1, I will analyse gene expression/pathways, HR, cellular localization of proteins and drug response in CRISPR transformed HGSOC lines. For aim 2, I will develop an ex-vivo model using tumour sections from primary tumours to validate potential therapeutic combinations from aim 1 in patient material.

Furthermore, how the cell types are maintained by stem cells throughout adulthood has important biomedical implications. Different from humans who age when their stem cells are depleted due to an imbalance between self-renewal and differentiation, simpler organisms, like cnidarians, continuously generate new cells from stem cells without any signs of senescence. However, the possible connection between cell type complexity, its evolution, and the non-senescent properties of stem cells in these organisms remain to be elucidated. In this project, we will identify and investigate the hitherto enigmatic stem cells and the full cell type diversity in a virtually immortal animal, the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. To this end, we will combine microfluidics-based single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), for unbiased molecular characterization of cell populations, with gene perturbation studies for assessing the functional roles of putative stem-cell marker genes. As a complementary approach, we will investigate the role of known genes commonly associated with the germline and pleuripotent stem cells. The identified candidate stem cells will be monitored by lineage tracing in transgenic animals to visualize their differentiation potential. We will test the function of the identified stem cell genes by gene knockdowns and in CRISPR/Cas9 mutants. The morphant embryos will be subjected to scRNA-seq to identify cell populations that are affected and hence, likely to be direct progenies of the stem cells. The molecular profiling will provide an objective and comprehensive basis for assessing the relationship between genetic and organismal complexity. Revealing the identity and molecular features of stem cells in this immortal animal will be key for our understanding of regenerative capacity and longevity.

Their efficient synthesis has remained a major challenge and the current limited access to these compounds severely impedes progress in modern research areas of RNA biology. The envisaged synthetic pathways also aim at increasing the structural diversity of cRNAs; this will be achieved by modifications concerning the phosphate backbone through formation of alternative internucleotide linkages (e.g. 2'-5'-, 5'-5'(3'-3')-phosphodiesters, phosphorothioates, triazoles linkages, amide linkages) and by insertion of distinct ribose modifications (e.g. 2'-OCH3, -F, -H, 2'-O–4'-C methylene (LNA monomers), 2'-tethers bearing reactive groups such as alkyne, vinyl, or amino groups). Importantly, in collaborative efforts with the team of Virginijus Siksnys, these novel cRNA derivatives will be tested for their potential as activators/inhibitors of CRISPR-associated (Cas) Csm6 ribonucleases, and additionally, in crystallographic studies aiming at a high resolution structure of the corresponding protein complexes. This cRNA–based signaling pathway has been discovered very recently and coordinates components of CRISPR-Cas to prevent phage infection and propagation. The research proposed here therefore aims at solving a fundamental scientific problem that links advanced synthetic bioorganic chemistry to highly topical research on CRISPR-Cas systems.

The blockade of immune checkpoints, such as the T-cell receptor PD-1, reduces tumour burden in patients and can lead to durable cures for some. Treatment efficiency is further improved when PD-1 is targeted simultaneously with other checkpoints such as CTLA4 or LAG3. Despite the potential of co-targeting multiple checkpoints, the combinatorial co-inhibition of all known as well as yet undiscovered immune checkpoints has not been systematically assessed. Furthermore, genome-wide screening to identify novel checkpoints as well as modifiers of such checkpoints has been technically challenging. The objective of this proposal is to map the combinatorial landscape of known checkpoints coupled with PD-1 blockade as well as discover potentially new targets for immune activation against cancer. We propose to use of transplanted hematopoietic stem cells with different combinations of disabled T-cell surface proteins to screen for combinations which enable T-cell infiltration and tumour reduction in a PD-1 suppressed mouse melanoma model. Initially combinations of known checkpoints will be assessed, subsequently the screen will be expanded to all T-cell membrane proteins to identify novel immune checkpoints.

We have previously found that reversion mutations BRCA1 or BRCA2 cause PARPi resistance. Others have shown that restoring DNA resection in BRCA1 mutant tumour cells, via 53BP1 or REV7 dysfunction, also causes PARPi resistance. In new unpublished data, we also show that mutations in PARP1 itself cause PARPi resistance by altering the ability of PARPi to “trap” PARP1 on DNA. This new data thus highlights how understanding the nature of trapped PARP1 could be key to understanding tumour cell and patient responses to PARPi in breast cancer. To understand this, we propose to study the composition of the trapped PARP nucleoprotein complex that is caused by the Pfizer PARP inhibitor talazoparib. To prosecute these studies, we will use a combination of standard and more novel biochemical approaches as well as in vitro genetic perturbation CRISPR-CAs9 approaches. We will use a multidisciplinary team to prosecute the work, with the contributions from those with expertise in functional genormic and PARP inhibitor biology (Lord) and the clinical assessment of novel therapeutic approaches in breast cancer including PART inhibitors (Tutt). In this proposal, we request funds to cover the salaries and running costs of two post-doctoral fellows and a contrinution towards bioinoformatic support to carry out the work. Identifying and understanding how novel approaches for treating breast cancer is critical to improving outcomes in the disease. We believe that observations and findings made in this work will (i) enhance the understanding of how tumour suppressor gene defects impart a series of genetic dependencies/vulnerabilities upon tumour cells; and (ii) inform how a molecularly-defined subset of breast cancer is best treated.

My 2018 publications in European Heart Journal and Circulation Research showed HCM could be phenocopied by a set of 11 isogenic CRISPR/Cas9 variants of the MYH7 gene (beta myosin heavy chain) of human pluripotent stem cell-cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs). Twelve different phenotyping methods were used to interrogate the generated human cell lines, often showing contradictory results relative to animal models. Importantly, a cohort of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) potentially linked to HCM was identified by RNA sequencing. This collection of cell resources, underpinning technologies and putative lncRNA pathway controllers form the basis of this proposal. Hypothesis and plans: I hypothesise that unveiling the function of these novel lncRNAs will provide new mechanisms and drug targets for HCM. To test this hypothesis, I propose to modulate the expression of these lncRNAs in hPSC-CMs by harnessing the dead Cas9 technology. I will then assess the phenotype of up/down-regulating these lncRNAs in the context of HCM, by employing the methodologies previously developed (molecular and functional assays). This will enable determining the role of lncRNAs in HCM - either as disease-causing or cardioprotective per se, or as gene modifiers regulating the primary disease effects caused by the structural defect. Finally, prediction and validation of lncRNA-interacting proteins by coupling in silico tools with molecular biology methods will result in the identification of new pathways involved in HCM, shedding light into the development of future drug treatments. If replacement of 50% of animals for HCM research could be achieved by further validating the human model, this will equate to sparing of 2100-5000 animals (of all species) in severe procedures in the next 10 years.

248	Dr Louise Fets	MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences	None	2019-03-01	2021-03-31	Understanding the role of transporters in drug uptake and cancer metabolism	Transporters play a vital role in physiology, regulating not only the uptake of nutrients into cells, but also the flux of metabolites between different cellular compartments. The importance of these proteins is illustrated by the fact that more than 80 monogenic diseases are associated with mutations in transporter-encoding genes. Tumour-specific metabolic changes are essential in order to fuel the increased proliferation rates of cancer cells, while also allowing them to survive in the often-hostile tumour micro-environment. Alterations in the expression patterns of transporters are a key component of these changes, allowing the cell to efficiently scavenge available nutrients and prevent a toxic build-up of waste products. Classically, entry of a drug into cells was thought to be determined by the compound lipophilicity, however it is now becoming clear that many drugs actually enter cells through membrane transporters. This means that the expression level of the relevant transporters will determine the intracellular concentration of a drug, thereby determining its efficacy, specificity, and potentially toxicity. In the case of tumours, altered transporter expression patterns may therefore define the drug sensitivity profile of a tumour, as well as dictating its metabolic profile. By combining analysis of large-scale, publicly available datasets with CRISPR screening/gene-editing and cell biology, we will identify specific transporters involved in the uptake of cancer therapeutic compounds in order to fully understand how they affect the efficacy of these drugs. As well as understanding their roles in pharmacology, we will use metabolomics to look at how our transporters of interest influence cancer metabolism, with the aim of exploiting this biology to drive efficient drug uptake. Additionally, the tools that we generate will enable us to identify the endogenous substrates of orphan transporters. Understanding which transporters are required for cellular uptake of cancer therapeutics could provide functional biomarkers to predict compound efficacy at the level of individual patients. This could allow personalised treatment plans based, in part, on transporter expression patterns, as well as enabling stratification of patients in clinical trials. In order to be able to implement these findings, we will establish robust quantitative proteomics assays to determine transporter expression patterns, initially from cell lines and animal models, and eventually (through collaboration) in patient samples.

However, despite clinical responses, the suppressive immune microenvironment(IME) is well described in MM and likely to explain the high CAR T-cell doses needed in patient studies. The co-administration of immunomodulatory drugs or appropriate T-cell engineering may counter suppressive pathways. However, the suppressive IME in MM following CAR therapy is not clearly understood. This fellowship will focus on the suppressive IME in MM, to provide the evidence base for effective combination strategies to optimise CAR T-cell therapy and improve patient outcome. Specific aims: 1)Characterise the IME effects on CAR T-cells a)The APRIL-CAR, developed during my PhD, is the only MM CAR in clinical trials in the UK. Bone marrow (BM) samples from the APRIL-CAR clinical trial will be analysed by flow and CyTOF and findings clinically correlated with outcome. Solid BM biopsy samples will be studied by chip-cytometry- a novel method allowing multi-parametric analysis of tissues. b)The effects of putative immune suppressive cell types on CAR function will be studied by in vitro culture systems using autologous suppressor cells, and pathways identified evaluated using blocking antibodies or CRISPR editing. c)Developing the first CAR/MM model in immunocompetent mice will allow study of the interaction between CAR T-cells and the IME in vivo. Data by flow, immunohistochemistry and RNAseq of bone marrow, will validate this model against findings in patient samples to assess its clinical applicability 2) Design of rational combination strategies With insight gained, strategies involving a)immunomodulatory agents or b)T-cell engineering will be tested in vitro/in vivo using systems outlined above with the aim of selecting combinations which significantly enhance disease control to take forward for clinical testing.

Characterisation of small molecules and hepatokines involved in this communication is critical to understand the molecular mechanisms leading to insulin resistance, the decline in ?-cell function, inflammation and cardiovascular complications associated with Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. However, the complexity of these metabolic diseases, that involve interactions between tissues such as the liver, adipose tissue, immune system and brain, the action of hormones and the network of signalling pathways linked to insulin, such as mTORC or the stress-activated cJUN N-terminal Kinase (JNK), has been difficult to decipher. JNK pathway is activated by consuming a high fat diet, and preventing this activation by tissue-specific ablation of JNK in mouse models inhibits the development of obesity, inflammation and insulin resistance. Therefore, JNK is critical in the crosstalk between metabolic organs and the immune response in the course of metabolic disorders, although its downstream effectors are largely unknown. We use mice with genetic and pharmacological inactivation of JNK in hepatocytes, Tandem Mass Tag (TMT-MS) proteomics and Next Generation Sequencing (RNAseq) as a viable strategy to identify new hepatokines involved in metabolic regulation. Using a TMT-MS screening we identified a group of JNK-regulated hepatokines, including proteins involved in immune response such as complement proteins or previously characterised metabolic regulators (such as RBP4), confirming the potential of this approach to identify metabolic regulators. In addition, we identified other secreted proteins without a known role in metabolic regulation. We aim to characterise interesting candidates identified in this approach. We will use adeno-associated viral vectors, CRISPR/CAS9-based systems and mouse models of obesity and insulin resistance to study the role of these hepatokines in the multi-organ crosstalk and metabolic regulation. The short-term goal of this proposal is to identify and characterise JNK-regulated hepatokines that may be involved in diet-induced inflammation and insulin resistance. The long-term goal of this proposal is to characterise novel mediators of the communication between organ systems that may be involved in diet-induced metabolic dysfunction, to uncover new diagnostic and therapeutic targets in metabolic pathologies.

Such mechanisms have mostly been described in basidiomycetous brown rot and white rot fungi, but are largely unknown in non-ligninolytic Ascomycota. Clonostachys rosea (Hypocreales, Ascomycota) is a filamentous with a broad range of ecological specializations from plant associations, saprotrophy to biotrophy and parasitism on nematodes and other fungi. Upon sequencing of C. rosea genomes, the gene family encoding GMC oxidoreductases classified as auxiliary activity family 3 (CAZy classification), specifically subfamily AA3_2 (aryl alcohol and glucose oxidases), was found to be significantly expanded. On the other hand, the genomes of the saprotrophs Neurospora crassa and Trichoderma reesei as well as the mycoparasites Trichoderma atroviride and Trichoderma virens (ecologically very similar to C. rosea) showed a significantly reduced AA3 gene content, suggesting that such enzymes are not essential for these nutritional strategies, and were either not acquired or lost by selective adaptation. This poses the question about the function of this many C. rosea paralogs, as this fungus is neither a prominent lignocellulose decomposer nor a plant pathogen, that would demand such an arsenal of genes for (ligno)cellulose degradation. The aim of this study is to elucidate the functionality and role of C. rosea GMC oxidoreductases, and identify the nutritional strategies they are involved in. Our research plan includes a transcriptional study of GMC oxidoreductases that are significantly regulated under the C. rosea major nutritional conditions, an investigation of the functional significance of GMC oxidoreductases in C. rosea (including single/multiple inactivation of genes using state-of-the-art CRISPR/Cas9 engineering tools) and biochemical characterization of selected GMC oxidoreductases that encode functional enzymes. Our large-scale approach will provide important insights in the regulation of gene families supporting different life-styles in C. rosea and highlight complex mechanisms of mycoparasitism and fungus-plant interactions.

Such cells can be obtained by in vitro direct reprogramming of somatic cells into embryonic stem (ES)-like cells, termed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). This approach also opens possibilities for modelling human diseases in vitro. However, major hurdles remain that restrain fulfilling conventional human iPSC/ESC potential, as they reside in an advanced primed pluripotent state. Such hurdles include limited differentiation capacity and functional variability. Further, in vitro iPSC based research platforms are simplistic and iPSC based “humanized” chimeric mouse models may be of great benefit. The recent isolation of distinct and new “mouse-like” naive pluripotent states in humans that correspond to earlier embryonic developmental state(s), constitutes a paradigm shift and may alleviate limitations of conventional primed iPSCs/ESCs. Thus, our proposal aims at dissecting the human naïve pluripotent state(s) and to unveil pathways that facilitate their unique identity and flexible programming. Specific goals: 1) Transcriptional and Epigenetic Design Principles of Human Naïve Pluripotency 2) Signalling Principles Governing Human Naïve Pluripotency Maintenance and Differentiation 3) Defining Functional Competence and Safety of Human Naïve Pluripotent Stem Cells in vitro 4) Novel human naïve iPSC based cross-species chimeric mice for studying human differentiation and disease modelling in vivo. These aims will be conducted by utilizing engineered human iPSC/ESC models, CRISPR/Cas9 genome-wide screening, advanced microscopy and ex-vivo whole embryo culture methods. Our goals will synergistically lead to the design of strategies that will accelerate the safe medical application of human naive pluripotent stem cells and their use in disease specific modelling and applied stem cell research.

Identification of new driver pathways is critical to develop credible personalised treatments. PTEN suppresses the oncogenic PI3K pathway and regulates homologous recombination (HR) and consequently its loss can be targeted by inhibitors of the PI3K and DNA repair pathways. I have recently identified that PTEN loss or downregulation is common in HGSOC (present in 281 of 447 cases), occurs mainly by copy number alterations (CNA), is associated with worse prognosis and offers possibilities for personalized therapy. My hypothesis is that the effects of PTEN activity in HGSOC are dose-dependent and expression levels and cellular localization of PTEN determine functional differences. I aim to 1) model the functional effects of PTEN haploinsufficiency or loss in tumour cell lines; 2) test small molecule inhibitors from Astrazeneca in combinations targeting PI3K pathway and HR. In aim 1, I will analyse gene expression/pathways, HR, cellular localization of proteins and drug response in CRISPR transformed HGSOC lines. For aim 2, I will develop an ex-vivo model using tumour sections from primary tumours to validate potential therapeutic combinations from aim 1 in patient material. The translational impact of this work will be to use PTEN expression/dosage as a validated biomarker for routine clinical stratification in clinical trials targeting the PTEN pathway in HGSOC.

The leading hypothesis for such coevolution is based on time-lagged negative frequency dependent selection (NFDS), also known as Red Queen coevolution. Evidence from population genetics (e.g. high genetic diversity and balancing selection at disease loci) is consistent with the idea that NFDS drives coevolution in host-parasite systems, but other models of coevolution (e.g., selective sweeps) cannot be easily excluded. Here I propose to test the predictions of the Red Queen coevolution hypothesis by analysis of hosts and parasite dynamics in one well-characterized population. In this Daphnia magna population we observe yearly strong epidemics of the bacterial parasite Pasteuria ramosa. I propose to test the hypothesis that coevolution in this system is driven by NFDS. Subproject A aims to identify the host genes that prevent parasite attachment in one particular population (“The Swisspond”), which has yearly strong epidemics of Pasteuria ramosa. We plan to compare different host-genotypes by sequencing from each resistotype multiple genomes and conduct genome-wide association mapping. In a next step we aim to pinpoint the exact genes responsible for the resistance polymorphism by employing molecular tools (CRISPR/Cas9) to knock down candidate genes in the regions of interest. The cloned offspring of the knock down genotypes will be tested for phenotypic effects in response to multiple parasite clones.Subproject B continues our efforts to find the infectivity genes in the bacterial pathogen Pasteuria. This parasite has now been fully sequenced and genomes from different isolates with known infection characteristics will be compared. As a further step we plan to do a proteomics approach, to identify the proteins which are expressed on the spore surface and which are responsible for the attachment of the parasite to the host. Subproject C aims to uncover the genetic interaction matrix between host and parasite genotypes. Host and parasite isolates from the field will be cloned in the laboratory and the mode of inheritance of resistance will be worked out by conducting genetic crosses among hosts. At the same time, infected hosts will be collected across the course of an epidemic in the field and will be genotypes for candidate genes at host resistance loci and parasite infectivity loci. This “co-genotyping” will allow estimating the strength of genetic host-parasite interactions during natural epidemics and enable us to estimate the strength of selection acting on different genotypes. Expected value of the research: This research aims to provide a convincing case study on the validity and predictions of the Red Queen coevolution hypothesis, offering urgently needed genetic data for theoretical and empirical research in evolution, epidemiology and disease biology. It has implications for our understanding of how coevolution shapes genetic diversity and genomes.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div. I-III)	834000.0	CHF

By recognizing and degrading mRNAs with premature termination codons (PTCs), many of which arise by alternative splicing, NMD serves as a quality control of gene expression and protects the cell from accumulating C-terminally truncated proteins with potentially toxic functions. However, a more general role of NMD in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression emerged from transcriptome-wide mRNA profilings that identified many physiological (i.e. PTC-free) mRNAs as NMD targets, overall affecting the mRNA levels of 3 - 10% of all genes in yeast, Drosophila, and human cells. NMD is essential in vertebrates and an important modulator of genetic disease phenotypes in humans, since 30% of all known disease-causing mutations are predicted to trigger NMD.Over the past 10 years, our lab has contributed both to the dissection of the molecular mechanism of NMD as well as to a better understanding of the biological function of NMD in mammalian cells. With the projects proposed here, we aim at continuing our research along these two lines by using a combination of biochemical, molecular biology, cell biology and reverse genetics methods. We plan to generate several inducible pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines with mutations in various NMD factors and assess their effect on the transcriptome and the capability of the cells to differentiate. The mutations will be introduced using recently developed genome-editing techniques (CRISPR/Cas). Compared to traditional knockdown-rescue experiments, the genome editing approach has the advantage that the effect of the mutant proteins can be assessed in the absence of any remaining low levels of WT protein possibly confounding the phenotype. On the biochemical side, one of our main goals is to establish a protocol to purify specific messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) populations that have been arrested at different stages along the NMD pathway and characterizing their composition by mass spectrometry. This will give us important insight into mRNP remodeling events during NMD. A third line of research concerns a follow-up of our recent finding that NMD appears to play a role in defending cells from RNA virus replication. We want to find out what makes the Semliki Forest Virus genomic RNA an NMD substrate and test other viruses for their sensitivity to NMD.Collectively, our research aims at understanding the molecular mechanism of NMD and its physiological role in human cells. This is the basis for the future development of highly specific approaches to manipulate in a controlled way NMD activity in different disease contexts.

261	Ao. Prof. Dr. Sascha MARTENS	University of Vienna	None	2015-06-01	2018-05-31	On the role of the Atg11 homology domain during selective autophagy	Autophagy is an intracellular process that mediates the bulk degradation of cellular material. During autophagy double membrane-bound vesicles called autophagosomes are formed de novo. Autophagosomes initially appear as small membrane structures called isolation membranes that gradually expand and thereby sequester cellular material. After their formation autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes (in complex eukaryotes) or the vacuole (in yeast) wherein the cargo is degraded. Autophagy thereby protects cells and thus the organism from various stresses including periods of starvation, protein aggregates, intracellular pathogens and damaged organelles. Consequently autophagy has been linked to various human diseases. It is becoming increasingly clear that autophagy can be highly selective with regard to the cargo that is captures within autophagosomes. Cargo receptor proteins specifically bind the cargo link it to the autophagic machinery via their interaction with scaffold proteins. In this proposal we will focus on the conserved Atg11-homology domain in the S. cerevisiae scaffold protein Atg11 and the human FIP200 protein. S. cerevisiae Atg11 interacts with the Atg19 cargo receptor and our preliminary results show that human FIP200 interacts with the p62 cargo receptor. Both interactions are mediated by the C-terminal Atg11 homology domain in the Atg11 and FIP200 scaffold proteins, respectively. Using biochemistry we will fine map these interactions and determine the structure of the Atg11-homology domain by X-ray crystallography. The biochemical and structural results will be tested in reconstitution systems employing cell lysates from CRISPR/Cas9 genome edited human cells and in assays for selective autophagy in S. cerevisiae and human cells lines. The experiments proposed here will yield fascinating insights into the coupling of selective autophagy cargo to the autophagic machinery. The cargo receptors and autophagic scaffold proteins are playing key roles and our experiments will help to unravel the mechanisms underlying this important process.

My 2018 publications in European Heart Journal and Circulation Research showed HCM could be phenocopied by a set of 11 isogenic CRISPR/Cas9 variants of the MYH7 gene (beta myosin heavy chain) of human pluripotent stem cell-cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs). Twelve different phenotyping methods were used to interrogate the generated human cell lines, often showing contradictory results relative to animal models. Importantly, a cohort of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) potentially linked to HCM was identified by RNA sequencing. This collection of cell resources, underpinning technologies and putative lncRNA pathway controllers form the basis of this proposal. Hypothesis and plans: I hypothesise that unveiling the function of these novel lncRNAs will provide new mechanisms and drug targets for HCM. To test this hypothesis, I propose to modulate the expression of these lncRNAs in hPSC-CMs by harnessing the dead Cas9 technology. I will then assess the phenotype of up/down-regulating these lncRNAs in the context of HCM, by employing the methodologies previously developed (molecular and functional assays). This will enable determining the role of lncRNAs in HCM - either as disease-causing or cardioprotective per se, or as gene modifiers regulating the primary disease effects caused by the structural defect. Finally, prediction and validation of lncRNA-interacting proteins by coupling in silico tools with molecular biology methods will result in the identification of new pathways involved in HCM, shedding light into the development of future drug treatments. If replacement of 50% of animals for HCM research could be achieved by further validating the human model, this will equate to sparing of 2100-5000 animals (of all species) in severe procedures in the next 10 years.

Significance: Many childhood cancers exhibit widespread epigenetic aberrations, including changes in DNA methylation and in histone marks. This is in stark contrast to their low frequency of genetic defects, and it suggests an important functional role for epigenome deregulation in these cancers. I have recently described massive changes in histone acetylation and genome-wide enhancer reprogramming for Ewing sarcoma, a difficult-to-treat pediatric tumor. In this project, I will investigate the hypothesis that Ewing sarcoma is an enhancer disease, characterized by highly orchestrated reprogramming of genome-wide histone acetylation patterns. This work will advance our understanding of Ewing sarcoma and of the epigenome’s role in pediatric cancers. It may also provide a molecular basis for pursuing epigenome editing and enhancer targeting and as new therapeutic strategies for Ewing sarcoma. Innovation: The proposed project focuses on a largely unexplored area of Ewing sarcoma research. Using the latest epigenome mapping technology, it will be possible to map and classify all enhancers that are driven by the oncogenic fusion protein EWS-FLI1. Furthermore, chromatin 3D mapping and bioinformatic analysis will connect the enhancers to their target genes genome-wide, and selected enhancer-gene links will be validated by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. I will also confirm the role of Ewing sarcoma specific enhancers in primary samples, using a cohort of 141 Ewing tumors for which I have already completed genome-wide DNA methylation sequencing. Approach: Aim 1. EWS-FLI1-driven enhancer landscape: Comprehensive mapping and integrative analysis of histone acetylation patterns and enhancer binding proteins in cells with tunable EWS-FLI1 expression Aim 2. Regulatory impact of EWS-FLI1-driven enhancers: Connecting Ewing sarcoma specific enhancers to their target genes via chromatin 3D structure mapping, CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, and enhancer RNA knockdown Aim 3. Enhancer activity in clinical samples: Correlating EWS-FLI1 driven enhancer activity to patient-specific gene expression profiles and clinical outcome in primary Ewing sarcoma tumors Environment: This project will be conducted in the laboratory of Prof. Heinrich Kovar at the St. Anna Children’s Cancer Research Institute (CCRI) in Vienna. The CCRI is Austria’s leading center for research on pediatric cancers and affiliated with the Medical University of Vienna. I will also collaborate with leading scientists in France (Olivier Delattre, Curie Institute), Austria (Christoph Bock & Keiryn Bennett, CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine) and the UK (Stephan Beck, University College London). Alignment with Funding Strategy: The proposed project addresses all goals of the Elise Richter Program: (i) it fosters career development of a qualified female scientist in Austria; (ii) the research program will establish the candidate’s scientific independence; (iii) the candidate provides a concrete career plan for becoming a principal investigator; (iv) the candidate pursues habilitation as the formal qualification for assistant professors in Austria.

Kinases are a group of enzymes that play a pivotal role in orchestrating the DNA-damage response, yet taken as a whole, the kinase family is largely understudied. To better understand the role of the human kinome in response to DNA damage we targeted the non-essential kinome (some 350 kinases in total) using CRISPR-Cas9 and subsequently screened these deficient cells against a panel of DNA damaging agents (16 in total), many of which are commonly used chemotherapeutics. This approach led to the identification of four novel interactions between kinases, frequently misregulated in cancer, (EPHB6, GSK3B, STYK16 and STYK1) and DNA damaging agents, used as chemotherapeutics. Now we aim to further investigate these novel interactions in a panel of cell lines, including patient-derived cell lines. Next we shall elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which loss of these kinases renders cells sensitive to DNA damaging inducing chemotherapeutics. Finally, we propose to prioritise and confirm our findings in a murine xenograft model for one of the identified interactions. Work resulting from this proposal may lead to the better treatment of patients with cancer due to mutations in the kinases EPHB6, GSK3B, STYK16 and STYK1.

The project will identify roadblocks to understanding, and develop clear analogies.Lessons from the Working Group will inform and influence the rest of the project - a public debate, an online poll and written materials.As we explore the Working Group's ideas about genome editing, the project's direction may shift accordingly. Our project will focus on human biomedical applications of genome editing, but other uses - see http://bit.ly/1ob4GDX on bioterrorism - may affect the group's attitude to the technology, and so cannot be disregarded.It is the perfect time to conduct this project. Genome editing is the focus of immense international interest, yet its future potential and possible applications are uncertain.

We hypothesize that the TET1/2/3 pathway governs some aspects of the stem cell-like epigenetic landscape of CSCs by depositing 5meC and 5hmC modifications on stem cell loci partly overlapping with hPSCs. Our objective is uncovering unique 5meC and 5hmC fingerprints on stem cell loci and the role of TET1/2/3 in CSCs, followed by proof-of-concept data for detecting PDACs based on these novel epigenetic signatures in PDAC patient versus healthy blood samples. The project has three sub-aims: 1. Characterising 5meC and 5hmC landscapes in pancreatic CSCs and hPSCs for uncovering unique epigenetic signatures common to these cell types. 2. Performing CRISPR-mediated knockdowns of TET1/2/3 for uncovering their phenotypic effects in pancreatic CSCs. 3. Providing proof-of-concept data for detecting the unique epigenetic signatures in PDAC patient blood samples.	Pancreatic Cancer UK	Research Innovation Fund	109986.69	GBP
267	Dr Louise Fets	MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences	None	2019-03-01	2021-03-31	Understanding the role of transporters in drug uptake and cancer metabolism	Transporters play a vital role in physiology, regulating not only the uptake of nutrients into cells, but also the flux of metabolites between different cellular compartments. The importance of these proteins is illustrated by the fact that more than 80 monogenic diseases are associated with mutations in transporter-encoding genes. Tumour-specific metabolic changes are essential in order to fuel the increased proliferation rates of cancer cells, while also allowing them to survive in the often-hostile tumour micro-environment. Alterations in the expression patterns of transporters are a key component of these changes, allowing the cell to efficiently scavenge available nutrients and prevent a toxic build-up of waste products. Classically, entry of a drug into cells was thought to be determined by the compound lipophilicity, however it is now becoming clear that many drugs actually enter cells through membrane transporters. This means that the expression level of the relevant transporters will determine the intracellular concentration of a drug, thereby determining its efficacy, specificity, and potentially toxicity. In the case of tumours, altered transporter expression patterns may therefore define the drug sensitivity profile of a tumour, as well as dictating its metabolic profile. By combining analysis of large-scale, publicly available datasets with CRISPR screening/gene-editing and cell biology, we will identify specific transporters involved in the uptake of cancer therapeutic compounds in order to fully understand how they affect the efficacy of these drugs. As well as understanding their roles in pharmacology, we will use metabolomics to look at how our transporters of interest influence cancer metabolism, with the aim of exploiting this biology to drive efficient drug uptake. Additionally, the tools that we generate will enable us to identify the endogenous substrates of orphan transporters. Understanding which transporters are required for cellular uptake of cancer therapeutics could provide functional biomarkers to predict compound efficacy at the level of individual patients. This could allow personalised treatment plans based, in part, on transporter expression patterns, as well as enabling stratification of patients in clinical trials. In order to be able to implement these findings, we will establish robust quantitative proteomics assays to determine transporter expression patterns, initially from cell lines and animal models, and eventually (through collaboration) in patient samples.

However, despite clinical responses, the suppressive immune microenvironment(IME) is well described in MM and likely to explain the high CAR T-cell doses needed in patient studies. The co-administration of immunomodulatory drugs or appropriate T-cell engineering may counter suppressive pathways. However, the suppressive IME in MM following CAR therapy is not clearly understood. This fellowship will focus on the suppressive IME in MM, to provide the evidence base for effective combination strategies to optimise CAR T-cell therapy and improve patient outcome. Specific aims: 1)Characterise the IME effects on CAR T-cells a)The APRIL-CAR, developed during my PhD, is the only MM CAR in clinical trials in the UK. Bone marrow (BM) samples from the APRIL-CAR clinical trial will be analysed by flow and CyTOF and findings clinically correlated with outcome. Solid BM biopsy samples will be studied by chip-cytometry- a novel method allowing multi-parametric analysis of tissues. b)The effects of putative immune suppressive cell types on CAR function will be studied by in vitro culture systems using autologous suppressor cells, and pathways identified evaluated using blocking antibodies or CRISPR editing. c)Developing the first CAR/MM model in immunocompetent mice will allow study of the interaction between CAR T-cells and the IME in vivo. Data by flow, immunohistochemistry and RNAseq of bone marrow, will validate this model against findings in patient samples to assess its clinical applicability 2) Design of rational combination strategies With insight gained, strategies involving a)immunomodulatory agents or b)T-cell engineering will be tested in vitro/in vivo using systems outlined above with the aim of selecting combinations which significantly enhance disease control to take forward for clinical testing.

Evidence is mounting that suggests the neurobiological basis of ASD is associated with projection neurons (PNs) of the mammalian neocortex during midfetal development. Although these advancements provide an entry point into studying the disorder, the molecular underpinnings of ASD as well as how the disparate risk alleles converge onto a common set of pathways leading to similar behavioral phenotypes are largely unknown. To identify the convergent pathways underlying ASD, we will genetically perturb ASD risk genes in utero and directly compare the resulting molecular, cellular, and morphological phenotypes in cortical PN subtypes. Building on our previous work on mouse models of ASD, transcriptional profiling, and in vivo and in utero genome editing, we will: Aim 1 - Develop CRISPR-Cas9 reagents to perturb high confidence ASD risk genes in utero. We will develop and validate CRISPR-Cas9 reagents targeting mouse orthologs of high confidence ASD (hcASD) risk genes CHD8, DYRK1A, ARID1B, and POGZ by in utero electroporation (IUE) and genome editing analysis in mice. Methods enabling the rapid modeling of loss-of-function (LOF) variants in ASD risk genes in vivo will facilitate the systematic interrogation of the underlying mechanism(s) of ASD.Aim 2 - Investigate gene-edited cortical progenitors and projection neurons in situ to reveal shared phenotypes. In mice harboring LOF variants in select hcASD risk genes, we will investigate cortical progenitor and PN phenotypes, such as progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation as well as PN composition and lamination, respectively. This approach will pinpoint relevant cell types and phenotypes shared upon perturbation of select hcASD risk genes.Aim 3 - Characterize gene-edited cortical projection neuron subtypes by transcriptional profiling to identify shared ASD pathways. From gene-edited mice, we will purify cortical PN subtypes harboring LOF variants in select hcASD risk genes and perform transcriptional profiling of each population at high resolution. An integrated analysis across genotypes will allow us to distinguish gene-specific effects from shared pathways, enabling the identification of critical cell types and the convergent pathways underlying perturbation of select hcASD risk genes.Aim 4 - Characterize gene-edited neurons by pooled in utero perturbation and single cell transcriptional profiling to identify convergent ASD pathways. Using pooled lentiviral CRISPR libraries, we will perturb 100 probable and high confidence ASD risk genes in utero, such that single cells receive single perturbation, and subsequently perform single cell transcriptional profiling. After linking ASD risk gene perturbations with single cell transcriptional profiles, we will perform an integrated analysis to characterize the cell states and convergent molecular pathways shared upon perturbation of 100 ASD risk genes.The proposed studies will establish an in utero methodology for rapidly perturbing and phenotypically investigating meaningful cell types harboring LOF variants in ASD risk genes in vivo, thereby overcoming current limitations in ASD research involved with animal model generation and cross-model comparisons. By investigating multiple ASD risk genes and cell types in parallel, under identical experimental conditions, we will elucidate critical features underlying the neurobiological mechanism(s) of ASD. The methodologies developed here will be a valuable resource to the field and can be extended to any gene or gene set of interest.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div.

My proposed research aims to advance our understanding of the mechanisms of cell competition and how it impacts on adult tissue biology, to advance our fundamental understanding of this biomedically-relevant process and learn how to harness it for therapeutics. Building on my group’s recent discoveries and methodological advances, I will use an integrated strategy combining in vitro and in vivo approaches to: 1) Elucidate how the oxidative stress response, which we found marks cells as ‘losers’ for competitive elimination, triggers cell competition in Drosophila. 2) Elucidate another link we discovered between aberrant autophagy in ‘loser’ cells and cell competition, in Drosophila. 3) Characterize the molecular mechanisms behind our discovery of p53-induced cell competition, using a CRISPR-based genomic screen in mammalian cultured cells. 4) Investigate the impact of cell competition on human adult tissue biology, using human primary keratinocytes and p53 competition-inducing mutations. 5) Carry out targeted proof-of-principle experiments to investigate for the first time whether cell competition can be exploited to improve tissue engraftment and repopulation in vivo, using the mouse airway.

Moreover, 2 – 3 years of chemotherapy are associated with significant morbidity and rare but potentially life-changing long-term toxicity, necessitating the need for more effective and less toxic therapies. Aims: The vision for this programme is to develop rationally designed, small molecule-based combination therapies for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: combinations that are highly active, non-toxic and prevent the emergence of resistant subclones. Methods: These combinations will be based on: • Targeted therapies that we are currently taking into early phase clinical trials in children with relapsed ALL (e.g. MEK and BCL2 inhibition) • Hypotheses-driven approaches (e.g. reactivation of p53, a key mediator of negative selection in normal B cell development) • Functional CRISPR screens in patient-derived cells to identify synthetic vulnerabilities in the context of exposure to targeted therapies • The identification of therapeutic targets through genome-wide CRISPR screens and the analysis of leukaemia-specific gene splicing Genome-wide CRISPR screening in the context of targeted therapies offers a step change in our ability to interrogate pathway dependencies and to select the most suitable inhibitors for effective combination therapies. Unbiased CRISPR screening in patient-derived cells and the analysis of plant homeodomain finger protein 5A (PHF5A)-mediated RNA splicing will determine the key drivers of the malignant phenotype in ALL. Our screens will identify opportunities for repurposing drugs already in clinical development and provide new targets for drug discovery. Most importantly, they will inform the translational/preclinical component of our programme in which we will test novel combination therapies using patient-derived cells in clinically relevant ex vivo and in vivo models. How the results of this research will be used: Our programme will generate robust preclinical data for novel combination therapies, based on mechanistic hypotheses and unbiased screening approaches, as the basis for innovative early phase clinical trials.

Researchers have used mice and rats to model kidney damage seen in human patients with diabetes, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, lupus and fibrosis injury. Although many useful gene and protein targets have emerged from these studies, rodent models are limited for a number of reasons. One is the ethical issues around the numbers of mice in particular that are needed to generate gene knockouts, particularly tissue-specific knockouts (usually in the 100s-1000s). A second limitation is the fact that mice and rat models do not faithfully recapitulate the disease phenotype seen in the human kidney. For example, the most commonly used genetic strain of mice, C57Bl/6, are resistant to diabetes-induced kidney damage. Many gene and proteins that have been identified in rodent models have failed to materialise as bona fide targets when tested in humans. These limitations have led to a growing frustration in academia and industry, and led to the drive to improve our models of CKD. We propose to establish a new model of kidney injury based on 3D organoids derived from human iPS cells. Our protocol of differentiation triggers the formation of both glomerular and tubular epithelial cells that form themselves into glomerular-like and tubule-like structures (Fig. 2). These organoids will form the basis of the three interrelated project aims, which will use cell biology, microscopy and single cell sequencing to interrogate the genetic profile of the kidney organoid cells (Aim 1). We will then establish a range of new models of CKD exposing organoids to high glucose and other important drivers of kidney disease to induce damage. Cutting-edge single cell sequencing using the 10 x Genomics platform (https://www.10xgenomics.com) will be applied in-house to interrogate the genetic profiles of each of the different kidney-like cells in 3D organoids in normal versus disease conditions. The sequencing data obtained from the various organoid damage models will then be compared to existing datasets from previously used rodent models of disease available on the GEO bioinformatics platform (e.g. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/GDSbrowser?acc=GDS3990). The critical role of Gremlin1 in organoid formation and response to fibrotic insult will be tested using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Successful completion of this project will achieve a number of scientific objectives. The first is the development of a next generation cell culture organoid model of kidney injury and CKD. The development of 3D organoid models is a common direction of travel in many fields, as the limitations of studying individual cells in isolation are becoming increasingly evident. A major outcome from this proposal will be reduction potential under the NC3Rs framework. Given the numbers of mice used for CKD experiments each year (estimated at approximately 68,000 in 2016, Fig. 1), and the moderate/severe grading of many of these experiments, we believe there is exciting potential to reduce these numbers in the future. Another significant deliverable will be the use of human iPS cells to generate the kidney organoids, which will represent a translationally relevant model of human kidney disease. The potential to modify the ES cells at the gene level using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing will allow researchers to interrogate the role of their gene of interest not only in kidney development, but also in kidney cell responses to disease insults in a 3D organoid. We will use our networks such as the European Renal Cell Study Group (ERSCG) in the UK, Europe and the US to promote the potential of the organoid model as an alternative to rodent models of CKD. Dissemination of our results at national meetings such as the UK Kidney Week and the American Society of Nephrology will maximise the potential of widespread uptake and create exciting added value for the project.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is an epidemic of the 21 st century and consumes almost 10 % of the health care budgets in westernised societies. Progressive pancreatic beta cell failure, characterised by altered gene expression and cellular "identity", are central to disease development. GWAS for T2D have now identified more than 100 loci associated with disease risk, most of which affect insulin secretion rather than action. In an effort to provide new targets for disease treatment, our laboratories have taken a functional genomic approach to identity the causal gene(s) at selected loci, to dissect their mechanisms of action at the molecular level, and to understand how they interact with other genes and environmental risk factors including over-nutrition. STARD10, located at a T2D locus on chromosome 11q, encodes an intracellular lipid binding and transfer protein whose expression is decreased in the beta cell by possession of risk alleles. Under Aim 1, we will explore the molecular mechanisms through which STARD10 affects insulin processing and secretion in human beta cells and human embryonic cell stem-derived beta cell lines deleted for the gene or nearby regulatory elements using CRISPR/Cas9-medated gene editing. In Aim 2 we will explore the mechanisms through which the protein kinase LKB1, and its downstream substrate AMPK, a nutrient-sensitive protein kinase, control beta cell identity, focussing on epigenetic changes and chromatin remodelling. We will also explore the effects of small molecule AMPK activators on insulin secretion in vivo, and develop a photactivatable AMPK regulator to achieve local control of the enzyme in the pancreas. Aim 3 will determine whether the actions of STARD10 on beta cell function are altered by deletion of LKB1, using both conventional mouse genetics and in vivo imaging of islet function after engraftment into the mouse eye.

It is a highly heritable, polygenic disease for which the strongest genetic association is with the MHC I molecule HLA-B*27. Despite this and other associations with genes of the innate and adaptive immune systems, the cellular and molecular causes of the disease remain enigmatic. Normally first detected in sacroiliac joints, AS is typified by enthesitis - inflammation at sites of muscle attachment to bone - which can lead to abnormal bone growth. Outside the joints, other sites subject to repeated mechanical stress are also prone to inflammation in AS. Acute anterior uveitis (AAU) of the eye, for example, is very common in AS patients and independently associated with HLA-B27. Current biologic anti-TNF and anti-IL17 therapies for AS only succeed in 60-70% of patients and cannot induce cure – hence an entirely new approach to investigation of disease causation is needed such as proposed here. We aim to discover the cells, pathways and genes that cause and respond to inflammation in HLA-B27 positive AS patients. We will perform the first detailed evaluation of gene expression and cellular function in multiple cell types in the affected tissues of patients with early disease. We will assess evidence for current disease models but will also be able to identify entirely novel pathogenic mechanisms. Finally, we aim to understand peripheral immune system activation in AS: this aspect of the work may identify biomarkers and/or treatment targets for early disease. Our approach combines single-cell genomics with spatial and functional analysis. Simultaneous transcriptomics, CITE-seq and V(D)J analysis of thousands of single cells will allow exquisite discrimination of cell types, activation states and, for T-lymphocytes, clonality. We will analyse samples from sacroiliac joints (where disease may start), from the eye (uveitic and non-uveitic tissue) and from inflamed knees (using RA samples as comparators). We will interrogate a combined map of cells from all three sites to find common features of pathogenesis. This map will shed new insights into the possible roles of genetically associated genes, which will in turn be used to pin-point the most relevant cell types. Patterns of cytokine and cytokine receptor expression will be inspected to build a cellular wiring-diagram of pathogenesis. The locations of cells of interest will be examined in diseased and healthy entheses by high-parameter CODEX analysis. After validation by CyTOF, candidate pathogenic factors will be subject to functional investigations in CRISPR or siRNA-based experiments. This research focuses on understanding early, biologic-naïve AS. It is designed to identify targets for therapies capable of halting and reversing disease at onset. The results will have wider impact because AS is the prototype of a set of related spondyloarthopathies. They will also be a useful comparator for studies of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. If successful, the work will help patients by aiding early disease detection and by providing a rational basis for development of curative therapeutics.

We hypothesize that the TET1/2/3 pathway governs some aspects of the stem cell-like epigenetic landscape of CSCs by depositing 5meC and 5hmC modifications on stem cell loci partly overlapping with hPSCs. Our objective is uncovering unique 5meC and 5hmC fingerprints on stem cell loci and the role of TET1/2/3 in CSCs, followed by proof-of-concept data for detecting PDACs based on these novel epigenetic signatures in PDAC patient versus healthy blood samples. The project has three sub-aims: 1. Characterising 5meC and 5hmC landscapes in pancreatic CSCs and hPSCs for uncovering unique epigenetic signatures common to these cell types. 2. Performing CRISPR-mediated knockdowns of TET1/2/3 for uncovering their phenotypic effects in pancreatic CSCs. 3. Providing proof-of-concept data for detecting the unique epigenetic signatures in PDAC patient blood samples.	Pancreatic Cancer UK	Research Innovation Fund	109986.69	GBP

Fibrosis is a common denominator in most forms of heart failure and predicts an 18-fold increased risk of sudden cardiac arrest. In this research proposal I aim to bio-model the interactions between cardiomyocytes, and cardiac fibroblasts through exosome signalling, hence providing a tool for better disease understanding and drug development. We previously generated human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) from patients harbouring hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) mutations. Many clinical HCM pathologies were phenocopied in the derived hiPSC-CMs. The system in this proposal aims to incorporate cardiac fibroblasts differentiated from the same genetic background to determine whether the release of abnormal exosome signalling between cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts contributes to the fibrotic nature of HCM. This will give new mechanistic insight into cardiac fibrosis and suggest new routes for translational therapeutics. This investigation can be broken down into three main objectives. 1) Impact of cardiomyocyte signalling on fibroblast function. Using isolated cardiomyocyte-derived exosomes, ask what the functional effects of these are on cardiac fibroblasts. Determine if these functional effects are altered by subjecting cardiomyocytes to high frequency stress stimulation. 2) Impact of cardiac fibroblast signalling on cardiomyocyte function. Using multiple measures of function, ask what the impact of healthy/stressed cardiac fibroblast-derived exosomes on cardiomyocyte function. 3) Role of HCM mutations in cardiac fibrosis. Using pre-existing CRISPR-engineered hiPSC lines that harbour HCM mutations, ask if sarcomeric mutations alter cardiomyocyte-fibroblast exosome signalling.

277	Dr Nidaa Ababneh	University of Jordan	None	2019-09-27	2019-10-27	Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and CRISPR-based genetic engineering for the study of neuromuscular disorders	Induced pluripotent stem cell technology offers unique advantages in modeling of rare diseases. Multiple studies have demonstrated that iPSCs carrying patient-specific mutations can recapitulate functional and cellular phenotypes observed in patients. In addition to modeling of the pathogenesis and functional deficits in rare diseases, advances in iPSC technology have potentially broad applications in drug discovery, toxicity testing, and developing novel drug screening platforms. Genomic editing to correct disease-causing mutations is a promising approach for the treatment of human diseases. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system has substantially improved the ability to make precise changes in the human genome. Combining iPSC technology with CRISPR system has provided the ability to repair mutated causative alleles in patient lines, or to introduce disease alleles into a healthy “WT” cell line. This has enabled analysis of isogenic cell pairs that differ in a single genetic change, which allows a precise assessment of the molecular and cellular phenotypes underlying this abnormality under the same genetic background. These isogenic cell lines can be used not only to understand the cellular consequences of disease mutations, but also to perform high throughput drug screens to both understand the underlying pathological mechanisms and to develop novel therapeutic agents to prevent or treat diseases. In this work, we plan to combine iPSC and genome editing technology for understanding molecular disease mechanisms of rare hereditary neuromuscular diseases. We will use patient-derived iPSCs to model neurological hereditary diseases. Using the latest CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we will introduce precise modifications into the genome of our patient-derived iPSCs and we need to produce the transfer viral vectors to modulate the expression of target gene in neuronal cell. Following genome editing, we will differentiate both unmodified and modified iPSC lines into disease-relevant cell types, such as cortical and motor neurons to study the underlying disease pathways. My visit will mainly involve an extensive training on the preparation of viral based gene transfer systems for research and therapy applications in neuromuscular diseases. Azzouz’s lab has extensive experience and track record in neurodegeneration research and collaborating with his group would be a great opportunity for us to develop our research plans. We expect that the collaboration would make a significant contribution to our research background. In particular, their broad experience in the generation of viral vectors to modulate the expression of target gene in neuronal cells, and studying DNA instability in patient derived neurons. This would help us to better understanding of the underlying disease phenotypes and to establish new therapeutic strategies and developing new drug screening platforms.

278	Professor Margaret Frame	University of Edinburgh	None	2016-10-01	2021-09-30	The international glioma cellular genetics resource	Background: High-grade glioma is the deadliest human cancer in children and adults below 40. It is a strategic priority for CRUK and CRUK Centres in Edinburgh and at UCL. Recurrent genetic and epigenetic perturbations in glioma have now been catalogued, but we lack functional genetic analyses in relevant preclinical models. This is essential if we are to define critical therapeutic targets for each disease sub-type. A unique opportunity has arisen to enable a step change in glioma research. We can culture patient tumour stem cells, as well as matched normal controls, and probe genetic and epigenetic alterations using state-of-the-art CRISPR-based genome editing. Edinburgh and UCL have expertise in these areas. The time is now right to link each Centre, exploit the combined large patient population base and link to developmental neurobiology at the Francis Crick Institute. Aims: We will create new open access resources – collectively termed the Glioma Cellular Genetics Resource (GCGR). This will stimulate new collaborations by creating much needed cellular models and genetic tools. Ultimately, it will accelerate innovative discovery science and provide new translational hypotheses. Key elements: There are five elements that are founded upon strengths in molecular pathology, glioma stem cell biology, developmental neurobiology and genome editing: (1) Patient-derived primary glioma stem cells: low passage, clinically and molecularly annotated primary glioma stem cells (across subtypes) will be generated, curated, analysed and stored, (2) Primary neural stem/progenitor cell reference controls: foetal, adult and patient-matched iPS cell-derived neural stem cells will be generated and provide crucial isogenic controls for genetic analyses, (3) Relevant genome-edited cellular models: CRISPR/Cas-based genome editing tools will be deployed to engineer genetic and epigenetic disruptions, as well as knock in reporters for live cell/tumour imaging, (4) Integrated open access database/portal; a dedicated ‘gateway’ website will be created, updated and managed, providing a user-friendly resource for all information on patient-derived glioma cells (including their modified derivatives), normal reference controls, clinical/pathological genomic annotation and available genome editing tools, (5) PhD studentships: understanding normal brain development is fundamental to tackling glioma. We will collaborate with world-leading neurobiologists at the Francis Crick Institute through new PhD studentships to provide inter-disciplinary training in the shared research themes of neural stem cells and brain cancer. We provide a few examples of exciting scientific projects that will be enabled and accelerated. The GCGR has the potential to transform interrogative and discovery glioma research, and create new translational hypotheses.	Cancer Research UK	SEB - Centres Network Accelerator Awards	None	None

We want to discover and target the most important metabolic adaptations and inhibit bypass angiogenic pathways. The combined approach will allow us to induce synthetic lethality. Aims 1. To evaluate the downstream signalling pathways of the angiogenesis related cell adhesion GPCR, ELTD1 and the role of exosomes. 2. To investigate novel pathways regulated by Delta-like 4 [DLL4], on endosomal distribution and release of the Notch intracellular domain. 3. To investigate the role of interferon signalling, induced by DNA damage after radiotherapy, in survival of tumour endothelium and its modulation by DLL4 4. To investigate the mechanisms by which the glycogen shunt enhances survival and its potential as a therapy target. 5. To conduct screens in hypoxia of a transposon tagged haploid ES cell library, for genes critical for survival. 6. To investigate the heterogeneity of the hypoxia response within cell populations and its mechanisms of regulation. Methods We will use inducible endothelial knockout mice for the ELTD1 investigations. Use of a systemic endothelial targeted siRNA delivery system will allow analysis of pathways of angiogenesis in xenograft tumours. Several vascular models will be used including zebrafish, CAM assays, neonatal mouse retina. We will use cell line models in vitro and in vivo, with gene expression inhibited either inducible shRNAi or CRISPR if cells can tolerate that degree of suppression. Molecular pathology, tissue microarrays and samples from window trials will help to test our findings and feedback into the laboratory. High-resolution imaging will be used for our angiogenesis work as well as using nanosensors for metabolites. Mass spectrometry and magnetic resonance will be used for metabolic studies. How the results of this research will be used Combinations of inhibitors of metabolism and inhibitors of angiogenesis from our work will be tested preclinically. They will provide key information on mechanisms to achieve synthetic lethality and increase effectiveness of both antimetabolism drugs and antiangiogenic drugs. These will extend to Phase I and Phase II window trials with imaging and pharmacodynamic endpoints. We expect to deliver understanding of how new agents regulate ELTD1, evidence for our siRNA targets to undergo clinical development.

280	Dr. Edze Westra	University of Exeter	None	2016-07-01	2018-06-30	Putative gene regulatory functions of Csy1, a component of the CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune system, in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa.	It is becoming increasingly clear that CRISPR-Cas (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; CRISPR associated) systems function beyond adaptive immunity. Preliminary data show that CRISPR-Cas deletion from Pseudomonas aeruginosa reduces both in vitro fitness and in vivo virulence. These phenotypes are caused by Csy1, a Cas protein thought to be involved in sequence-specific binding of the 5'-handle of crRNA. We hypothesise that Csy1 regulates expression of genes carrying sequen ce motifs similar to the 5'-handle. We will test this hypothesis by (1) transcriptome analysis of WT and Csy1 deletion mutants, (2) RIP-seq analysis of RNA co-purifying with Csy1 and (3) EMSA to measure sequence specificity of Csy1-RNA interactions. This project will reveal whether Csy1 of the P. aeruginosa CRISPR-Cas system is involved in a gene regulation function and will identify specific RNA motifs targeted by Csy1. If successful, the data from this seed project will serve as a basis for a full grant proposal aimed at (1) validating the Csy1-motif interactions in vivo (2) generalising Csy1-mediated gene regulation across P. aeruginosa strains and (3) testing the impact of Csy1 on P. aeruginosa virulence in other, more relevant, infection models, such as cell culture and thermally injured mouse infection models.

281	Dr Edwin Chen	University of Leeds	None	2016-08-01	2018-12-31	R-loop Dysregulation in Myeloid Neoplasms	Insights gleaned from pre-neoplastic disorders have reinvigorated interest in the cancer-specific properties that trigger and respond to DNA damage. Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are pre-leukaemic disorders that reflect an early-stage malignancy with the potential to progress to acute leukaemia. We have previously demonstrated that MPN-derived tumour cells exhibit perturbations in DNA replication that lead to DNA damage. We now have exciting preliminary data implicating nucleic acid structures called “R-loops” as the primary cause of MPN-associated genomic instability. R-loops are essential for multiple normal cellular processes but can also promote DNA damage if inappropriately regulated. This seed award application is focused on a central question: why do R-loops promote DNA damage in MPN cells but not normal cells? To address this issue, we will undertake two thematically-related but non-overlapping streams of investigations. For Aim 1, we will use an unbiased proteomics-based approach to characterise any differences in protein composition of R-loops between normal and MPN cells. For Aim 2, we will perform a pooled CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic screen to identify genes that modulate how MPN cells regulate R-loop-induced recombination. Cumulatively, we hope to generate preliminary data that starts to deconvolute the structural and functional complexity of R-loops in leukaemia development.

The global cancer burden is expected to double by the year 2030 and this will disproportionately affect the Asian continent. Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is endemic in Asia, and it is one of the top 3 cancers in Malaysia. Long-term survival of less than 50% and limited approved therapies for HNSCC underscore the urgent need for the development of novel and effective therapies. While the mutational landscape of HNSCC is now well established, the ability to identify the targetable component of the cancer genome will accelerate translation of these knowledge into clinical benefit. A major focus in the development of new cancer therapies has been the identification of essential genes that are critical for the survival of cancer cells, and where loss or inactivation of these can result in cell death or growth arrest. This project will use state-of-the art biological models, genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 lethality screens and next-generation sequencing, to address this major health problem in Asia. We will use experimental and computational approaches to identify essential genes for HNSCC and specific pharmacologic inhibitors that could target these genes. The successful completion of this project will form the basis of developing novel targeted drugs for HNSCC as well as re-purposing existing therapies currently used to treat other cancer types.

Recent whole-genome and epigenome profiling studies in CLL reveal that enhancer elements not only show massive DNA methylation changes but are also subjected to non-coding mutations. These findings suggest that (epi)genetic alterations of enhancers may modify their activity leading to differential expression of target genes. As such, enhancer alterations may represent a new generation of drivers in CLL pathogenesis. The global aim of this proposal is to investigate the clinico-biological impact of (epi)genetic changes of enhancers in CLL. We will initially characterize the epigenome of CLL samples from the Spanish CLL Genome Consortium to extend the small series generated in the European Blueprint Project. Then, we will precisely analyze the impact of DNA methylation and non-coding genetic variants on the activity level of enhancers defined by specific histone marks (H3K4me1 and H3K27ac) by ChIP-seq and chromatin accessibility by ATAC-seq in the very same cases. For candidate regions in which the DNA methylation level or mutational status correlates with enhancer activity, we will initiate functional analyses using a custom CRISPR-guide RNA library to disrupt the selected enhancers and measure their downstream transcriptional effects in CLL cell lines. Subsequently, individual disruption or mutation of enhancers using specific CRISPR vectors will allow us to measure their downstream biological effects and 4C-seq experiments will allow us to link enhancers to genes. Furthermore, the impact of genetic or epigenetic changes in enhancer activity will be additionally evaluated for a subset regions using by luciferase experiments. Finally, we will study the clinical impact of (epi)genetic changes in functionally-relevant enhancer regions. This integrative analysis shall lead to novel insights into CLL pathogenesis and evolution as well as provide new biomarkers with unprecedented clinical value and potential therapeutic targets.

To survive in this hostile environment microbes have evolved an adaptive immune system called CRISPR-Cas. The immune system is based on incorporation of invader DNA sequences in a memory locus (CRISPR), the formation of guide RNAs from this locus, and the degradation of invading target DNA using CRISPR RNA-guided protein complexes. Invaders escape immunity by making point mutations in the targeted region of their DNA, but hosts quickly restore immunity by integrating new memory sequences against the same invader in a process called priming. Recently, I have made the remarkable discovery that hosts mount a primed immune response even when facing heavily mutated invaders. This implies that the memory of the CRISPR-Cas system not only functions in the short term against relatively recent threats, but also remembers a range of revisiting old foes in the long term, providing a huge evolutionary benefit for the host in the arms race with their invaders. This proposal sets out to determine the mechanism of the enigmatic process of primed memory formation against heavily mutated invaders. Using a combination of genetic, biochemical and structural approaches, including state-of-the-art single molecule imaging of CRISPR immunity in living Escherichia coli cells, I will investigate the driving hypothesis that perfectly matching and degenerate targets are differentially recognized, and trigger either target DNA degradation or priming. Moreover, I will test the supposition that degenerate priming is a universal phenomenon among different CRISPR-Cas types. If this is the case, degenerate priming will impair the use of viruses as therapeutic agents to treat antibiotic resistant bacterial infections. To prevent CRISPR resistance I propose to screen for organic molecules that inhibit the formation of CRISPR resistance. These molecules can be co-administered with viruses to potentiate treatments.

Efforts to treat obesity are hampered by the fact that the mechanisms causing obesity are still poorly understood. A large body of evidence ranging from animal lesion and genetic studies to monogenic and GWAS studies have identified as obesity as largely a disease of the brain. In particular, neurones in the hypothalamus are central regulators of feeding behaviour whose loss or dysfunction is sufficient to cause severe obesity. I have developed a method to generate human hypothalamic neurones from pluripotent stem cells. Human stem cell-derived hypothalamic neurones share cardinal features of their counterparts in the brain. Furthermore, I used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to modify the genomes of human stem cells to generate knock-in reporters for cell types of interest. One cell type of particular interest is the hypothalamic neurone that produces neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP). These NPY/AgRP neurones so potently stimulate feeding that their ablation in the adult brain leads to a cessation of feeding to the point of starvation, and their specific activation via pharmacogenetic or optogenetic methods stimulates immediate and voracious feeding. As a New Blood MRC fellow, I will develop human stem cell-derived NPY/AgRP neurones into a tractable system for studying obesity. In particular, the secretion of NPY and AgRP peptides from these cells is detectable by ELISA. I will test the hypothesis that candidate obesity-associated mutations in genes that are highly enriched in NPY/AgRP neurones alter neuropeptide release. Since AgRP is a melanocortin peptide that directly inhibits the MC4R receptor found on feeding-inhibitory second order neurones, this phenotype would have a clear mechanistic link to obesity.

286	Dr Mariya Moosajee	University College London	None	2018-05-29	2021-05-28	Generating in vitro human optic vesicles to dissect the genetic modifiers affecting ocular maldevelopment	Ocular maldevelopment is responsible for more than one-third of blindness and severe visual impairment in children worldwide. It encompasses whole eyeball abnormalities e.g. microphthalmia [abnormal small eye], anophthalmia [complete absence of the eye] and ocular coloboma [cleft of the eye], collectively known as MAC. It is the most common cause of childhood sight impairment certification in England and Wales, accounting for 18.4%. The UK incidence of MAC is 10.4 per 100,000 live births, with only 2% considered related to environmental factors e.g. maternally vitamin A deficiency and teratogenic exposure. There are approximately 90 genes known to cause non-syndromic and syndromic MAC, accounting for only 6% of genetic diagnoses. SOX2 and OTX2 are responsible for 60% of the severe bilateral cases of anophthalmia and microphthalmia. Little is known about the dysfunction of these key genes acting between 4-7 weeks gestation, as access to human ocular tissue is near impossible at this critical stage of early eye development. As a result there have been no comprehensive human studies investigating normal and abnormal ocular development as no suitable model exists. Most work is undertaken on animal models but these are suboptimal for several reasons: (i) the eye develops differently, for example the zebrafish optic and lens vesicles are solid structures that cavitate, unlike the human equivalent which are hollow, (ii) some genes fail to generate a comparable phenotype when disrupted due to potential redundancy, or (ii) cause embryonic lethality if knocked out preventing further study. Of the families with a positive genetic diagnosis there is significant inter-familial phenotypic variability e.g. some affected members display a unilateral anophthalmia, others a bilateral microphthalmia and some unaffected family members harbour the mutation but with non-penetrance. This proposal aims to discover and understand the role of genetic modifiers in ocular maldevelopment. We will replace the use of zebrafish and mouse models and optimise the use of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology to derive human in vitro 3D optic vesicles. We will dissect the molecular pathways disrupted by an OTX2 mutation (c.97+1delG intron 3) in a three-generation family displaying extremes of phenotypic variability. We will use CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to correct the mutation in one patient’s iPSC to observe reversal of the phenotype in the human model to determine whether the mutation is unequivocally causative or not. Comparative analysis of the transcriptome in optic vesicles will provide information on the gene expression profiles and help to identify potential predisposing/protective genetic modifiers that could be exploited to develop a therapy and immediately inform genetic counselling for families. Identifying genetic modifiers will allow us to investigate the interplay between genotype, gene expression and phenotype in early human eye development and provide useful genetic tools for future human organoid cultures. It will demonstrate the efficacy of an in vitro system to study gene function. Mouse, zebrafish and xenopus geneticists and developmental biologists will be encouraged to use organoid cultures as replacement for in vivo studies for a more accurate representation of human eye development.

Despite recent progress, adaptation is to date a poorly understood process largely due to limitations of current approaches that focus (i) on a priori candidate genes, (ii) on signals of selection at the DNA level without functional validation of the identified candidates, and (iii) on small sets of adaptive mutations that do not represent the variability present in natural populations. As a result, major questions such as what is the relative importance of different types of mutations in adaptation?, and what is the importance of epigenetic changes in adaptive evolution?, remain largely unanswered. To gain a deep understanding of adaptation, we need to systematically identify adaptive mutations across space and time, pinpoint their molecular mechanisms and discover their fitness effects. To this end, Drosophila melanogaster has proven to be an ideal organism. Besides the battery of genetic tools and resources available, D. melanogaster has recently adapted to live in out of Africa environments. We and others have already shown that transposable elements (TEs) have substantially contributed to the adaptation of D. melanogaster to different environmental challenges. Here, we propose to use state-of-the-art techniques, such as Illumina TruSeq sequencing and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, to systematically identify and characterize in detail adaptive TE insertions in D. melanogaster natural populations. Only by moving from gathering anecdotic evidence to applying global approaches, we will be able to start constructing a quantitative and predictive theory of adaptation that will be relevant for other species as well.

The project will be delivered in four workpackages (WP) over a three year period at UCL and UoC, with additional contributions from existing UKRMP hubs. 1. Methodologies to eliminate HLA, addressing 'missing self' and safety risks. CRISPR sgRNAs will be identified and validated for efficient HLA class I and II disruption and delivered using our hybrid lentiviral-CRISPR vector system. Transgenes encoding a replacement non-polymorphic HLA-G and/or a dimerising suicide gene will be coupled to CRISPR delivery, with Cas9 mRNA delivered transiently by electroporation. Alternative deamination base-editors will also be investigated to mitigate against the risk of translocation events in cells undergoing multiplexed editing. 2: Human pluripotent stem cell modification and differentiation Established HPSC lines (embryonic or induced) will be evaluated for their ability to support differentiation to hepatocytes or macrophages. Lines with optimal capacity will be selected for generation of universal hepatocytes (devoid of HLA lass I) or macrophages (devoid of HLA class I & II). In vitro sensitivity to anti-HLA antibodies will be examined, as well cellular responses mediated by healthy donor mismatched T and NK cells. 3: Characterization of genotoxicity risk Next generation sequencing will be used to quantify of on and off target activity. Sites of possible off target activity will be informed by Digenome analysis. Predicted translocations will be quantified by targeted qPCR and karyotypes assessed, including by FISH where possible. 4: Function and stealth of modified cell lines Persistence and immune-evasion of universal HSPC derived teratomas, macrophages and hepatocytes will be examined in humanised immunodeficient mice using healthy donor T and NK cells.

Muscle fibrosis, an associated feature of the disease, causes muscle dysfunction and contributes to the lethal DMD phenotype. This proposal seeks to examine whether upregulation of expression of relaxin can reduce/reverse the skeletal muscle fibrosis associated with DMD, since this peptide hormone of the insulin superfamily is a natural suppressor of age- and disease-related fibrosis in number of other tissues. Enhancement of gene expression is possible using a mutant non-catalytic dead Cas9 (dCas9) through its tethering to transcriptional activators [VP64-p65-Rta (VPR)]. This proposal seeks to explore the potential of CRISPR/Cas9 technology to transcriptionally upregulate expression of relaxin as an anti-fibrotic therapy for DMD using this SP-dCas9-VPR. Guide RNAs targeting upstream of the transcriptional start site of the Rln1 gene will be screened in Cas9-expressing HEK293T cells and the optimal guide RNA then used in conjunction with SP-dCas9-VPR in immortalised DMD patient cells. The effect of this treatment on the transcriptional of Rln1 and also a number of fibrotic genes will be examined using real-time RT-PCR.	Wellcome Trust	Vacation Scholarships	2000.0	GBP

To identify new therapeutic targets in AML, Dr Vassiliou's group recently performed CRISPR-Cas9 dropout screens and identified 492 AML-specific cell-essential genes, including several established anti-leukaemic drug targets and many novel therapeutic candidates. Going forward they will apply this technology to AML subtypes defined by particular somatic mutations. One subtype of AML is defined by TP53 gene mutations and is associated with an abysmal prognosis, with <10% survival. The aim of the proposed summer project will be to establish and validate TP53 knock-out (KO) clones generated from established TP53 wild-type (WT) AML cell lines using CRISPR-Cas9. These lines will then be used for comparative dropout screens to identify TP53-specific cell-essential genes, which could serve as therapeutic targets. For this, I will design and test different gRNAs for their effectiveness in knocking-out TP53. Cas9-expressing MOLM13 and MV4-11 cell lines will be transfected (separately) with lentiviruses carrying TP53-targeting or control gRNAs. Pooled cells will then be single-cell-sorted and clones assessed for TP53 knock-out efficiency using qRT-qPCR and western blotting. The best clones will then be used for downstream genome-wide screens.	Wellcome Trust	Vacation Scholarships	2000.0	GBP

In particular, mirroring their unparalleled morphological and cellular complexity, vertebrate brains show the highest levels of regulated AS known in nature. However, the functions of most of these alternative transcripts, and the evolutionary impact that the increased transcriptional complexity has had on the evolution of the vertebrate brain are still widely unexplored. In this project, we will investigate the functions and evolutionary impact of neural AS in vertebrates. We will focus on neural-specific alternative exons that are highly conserved across vertebrate groups (suggesting functional importance), but that are not conserved in invertebrates, and are thus vertebrate-specific genomic novelties. We will term these exons Vertebrate- and Neural-specific Alternatively Spliced (VN-AS) exons. Through a combination of bioinformatics, experimental manipulation in models species, and systems-level network analysis, we aim to: (i) Comprehensively identify VN-AS exons, and study their regulation during vertebrate neurogenesis and nervous system development, using RNA-seq and comparative genomics; (ii) Probe the phenotypic impact of VN-AS exons on vertebrate nervous systems, using the CRISPR-Cas technology for genome editing; and (iii) Investigate how VN-AS exons rewire protein-protein interaction networks in vertebrate neurons - an emergent molecular function for AS -, and whether this rewiring underlies novel functions of VN-AS exons in the vertebrate brains. This project will thus deliver fundamental insight into two major unanswered questions: (i) what are the functions of transcriptomic diversification, and (ii) how does transcriptomic diversification impact organismal evolution. Our results will fill a large gap of knowledge in our current understanding of brain evolution and development, providing a complementary angle to traditional gene expression studies.

This project will determine the structural properties and drug-binding potential of two regions of the viral RNA essential for invasion and propagation of the COVID-19 genome in host cells: genes responsible for making spike and fusion proteins. Specifically, the project will develop new and efficient graph-theory based computational algorithms for identifying subregions in the COVID-19 viral genome that alter the RNA substructure when they are mutated. Identification of these subregions will aid in the discovery of anti-viral inhibitor compounds. Graph theory tools already developed in the PI?s lab offer coarse-grained approaches for RNA structural analysis and design. The PI will combine these tools with biomolecular modeling to examine the therapeutic potential of anti-viral inhibitors known from SARS, MERS, and other viruses. This project will produce structural insights into the RNA viral regions and identify critical nucleotides and candidate inhibitors that will help make progress against COVID-19. The research has profound impact to COVID-19 as well as other coronaviruses that could emerge in the future. The project offers unique interdisciplinary training in mathematics, biology, chemistry, and scientific computing for young scientists, including women and minorities. The research results will be shared rapidly with the COVID-19 research community at large.<br/><br/>RNA-targeting approaches have therapeutic potential due to the high sequence and structure conservation of the viral genomes and the rapid emergence of CRISPR technology. They also present alternatives when protein-inhibiting compounds lead to invasion of the RNA viral genome itself. Such compounds that alter the RNA structure significantly are expected to inhibit viral invasion and replication. Because the fusion-protein coding region contains a pseudoknot (intertwined base-pair) substructure involved in a frame-shifting mechanism, the determination of critical mutation regions and associated compounds that destroy this pseudoknot will be invaluable. The project team has rich experience in biomolecular modeling and simulation of nucleic acid complexes and has developed a graph-theory framework for analyzing RNA motifs, predicting structures, and designing novel RNA folds. The graph-theory framework will be extended and applied in this project to address the COVID-19 pandemic by determining key regions in the RNA COVID-19 viral genome and associated chemical inhibitors that would interfere with viral fusion into and replication within host cells. With this award, the Mathematical Biology Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry are funding Dr. Schlick from New York University to determine the structural properties and drug-binding potential of the COVID-19 viral RNA.<br/><br/>This grant is being awarded using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Parasitic nematode-NTDs inflict devastating disease on >1 billion of the world’s poorest people, promoting destitution, and diminishing the health and socio-economic status of ODA countries. Increasing risk of drug resistance, and shortfalls in available chemotherapies/treatment options for some parasites, magnify the urgent need for new drugs. New, robust chemotherapy pipelines are required for the sustainability of nematode-NTD control. Novel drug target discovery in parasitic nematodes (PNs) relies on the development of advanced functional genomics tools, however this has been hindered by PN genetic intractability. At present the human pathogen Stronglyloides stercoralis is the only PN amenable to genome-editing techniques. This study will exploit S. stercoralis CRISPR/Cas9, the most advanced PN functional genomics platform, as a translational model for parasite biology and novel drug target candidacy. GPCRs control many important aspects of PN biology but remain chemotherapeutically unexploited. Their pharmacological appeal is underscored by mammalian GPCR-druggability and the unlikely potential for inherent cross-resistance. This work will employ in silico tools and localisation techniques to identify novel GPCR-targets for functional validation. Endocannabinoid-GPCRs modulate core biological processes and are appealing PN drug targets. Nematode-EC signaling knowledge is limited to Caenorhabditis elegans, however preliminary data reveal EC-GPCR conservation and functional importance in key PN-NTD pathogens. Initially, in a proof-of-concept approach, endocannabinoid (EC) GPCR-targets will be identified, prioritised and validated using the S. stercoralis genome-editing platform.

295	Dr Michael Flower	University College London	None	2020-03-01	2022-02-28	The DNA damage response in Huntington’s disease	This grant aims to elucidate how DNA maintenance pathways influence the stability of DNA repeat tracts, and harness this knowledge to therapeutically modulate the DNA damage response (DDR) in HD and other repeat expansion diseases. In HD, somatic expansion of the CAG repeat is a key driver of disease course. Recent genetic studies have identified DNA maintenance genes, particularly those involved in mismatch repair (MMR), as modifiers of onset and progression in repeat expansion diseases. DNA repeat tracts form abnormal secondary structures, which are substrates for MMR, and the resulting strand slippage likely introduces expansions. We have shown FAN1 protects against, and MSH3 is required for, repeat instability. We developed cell models, including iPSC-derived MSNs, that recapitulate the expansion rate and repeat length dependence observed in human striatum. We will knockout MSH3, and introduce modifier variants, investigating for effects on DNA repair activity, protein interactions and repeat instability. Using patient-derived lymphoblasts from the TRACK-HD study, we will determine whether the MSH3 modifier variant influences the repair activity and repeat instability. We will investigate the therapeutic potential of ASO-mediated MSH3 knockdown. The role of DNA damage, abnormal secondary structures and DNA replication in somatic instability will be studied in HD and other repeat disease IPSC cell lines. We will identify novel modifiers of repeat instability through a CRISPR screen, and compliment this with an shRNA screen of DDR network components in our cell models. Modulation of DNA maintenance has great therapeutic potential in HD and other repeat expansion disorders.	The Academy of Medical Sciences	None	30000.0	GBP
296	Professor Vincent Dion	CARDIFF UNIVERSITY	None	2020-01-01	2023-01-01	AMS Professorship Award for Professor Vincent Dion, Cardiff University	There is currently no disease modifying treatment for any of the expanded CAG/CTG repeat disorders. Our goal is to remedy this. We identified two attractive single use therapeutic options to treat these disorders. One is to contract the repeat tract, the other is to silence the expression of the expanded allele. Current approaches using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are working their way to the clinic; CRISPR-based ones are not far behind. Unfortunately, such treatments target both the mutant and normal alleles. Indeed, in 13 of the 14 expanded CAG/CTG repeat disorders, patients are heterozygotes. The normal allele often performs important functions and it should remain untouched. Moreover, the ASO-based approaches must be administered continually throughout the individual’s lifetime, creating a significant burden on their quality of life. We have recently shown that gene editing can be allele-length specific by using the CRISPR-Cas9 nickase. Such a treatment would correct the cause of these diseases permanently. Here, we aim to identify novel factors that can be harnessed to silence expanded CAG/CTG repeats specifically, independently of disease locus. We will thereby open the way for new therapeutic options for all expanded CAG/CTG diseases. We will use a variety of novel high throughput screening approaches in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from patients. We will collaborate with the Medicine Discovery Institute at Cardiff University, which develops drugs against cancer and neurological diseases. Our CRISPR-based approach is highly promising, and the next step is to establish that the frequency of off target mutations is low enough to move into the clinic. This is a challenging issue since the current methods for measuring CRISPR-mediated off-targets are suitable neither for detecting nicks nor for monitoring changes in repeat size. Here we aim to use Huntington disease as a model system to develop a new method of identifying off target mutations using single-cell sequencing. For all projects running in my lab, a major challenge is to obtain bespoke bioinformatics support. Arguably, the best way of doing so is to embed a computational biologist into my research group. This will allow lab members to exchange ideas, leading to better experimental design and more efficient analysis methods. The AMS professorship supporting such a post would provide a major boost to every project in my lab. Furthermore, I could support a postdoc for two years with the aim to obtain a postdoctoral fellowship and become successful in his/her own rights. This is a critical time for me as I establish my lab in a new country. My approach to this is two fold. First, I plan to acquire competitive funding. Second, I aim to grow a national network. The AMS professorship would be especially helpful for both of these goals. The funding it provides would give me time to gather preliminary data and successfully obtain funding from major funders, including the MRC and the Wellcome Trust. In addition, the AMS career development events would help me tremendously towards building a new network of collaborators.

297	Professor Ulrich Rass	University of Sussex	None	2020-01-01	2023-07-31	AMS Professorship Award for Professor Ulrich Rass, University of Sussex	After a PhD at the University of Cologne and postdoctoral work at Clare Hall with Steve West (CRUK) on mechanisms of DNA break repair and links to premature ageing, neurodegeneration, and cancer, I have set up my own research programme as Junior Group Leader at the Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research (FMI) in Basel. Following my recent move to the Genome Damage and Stability Centre, I am looking to establish research lines in chromosome maintenance and replication in the UK. This is supported by University of Sussex start-up funding, ensuring continuity of ongoing basic research projects. Funding from the AMS Professorship Scheme would provide the opportunity to bridge the gap between basic and translational research, allowing me to pursue a two-pronged approach to understand the cellular responses to replication stress on a molecular level, and test whether the enzymes involved can be suitable anti-cancer targets. Inherent replication stress sensitizes cancer cells to interference with DNA repair and replication fork maintenance, providing a potential point of therapeutic intervention. Our discovery of the Dna2-Yen1 axis has provided a handle on the ill-defined processes occurring at perturbed replication forks. We will explore the molecular space surrounding Dna2-Yen1/GEN1 using molecular genetics, analyses of DNA structures and replication intermediates, and by investigating downstream events re-establishing chromosome integrity following nucleolytic sister-chromatid separation in mitosis. We have already identified additional activities of the Dna2-Yen1 pathway, suggesting active processing of the leading and lagging strands, consistent with extensive replication fork remodelling. These insights have inspired my aspiration to move into translational studies using a pathophysiologically-relevant MCF10A-based HER2-DELTA-dirven breast cancer model. HER2-DELTA cells grow in 2D, as 3D organoids, and give rise to tumours in mice. Our unpublished results show significant attenuation of cancer-cell growth upon CRISPR-Cas9-mediated DNA2 point mutations (abrogating its nuclease or helicase activities) or knock-out of the MUS81 nuclease (which shares functions with GEN1). Excitingly, MUS81 and DNA2 mutations abolished tumour-uptake in mice (with Prof. Bentires-Alj, University-Hospital Basel), which is consistent with the hypothesis that cancer cells develop a non-oncogenic addiction to key effectors of the replication stress response and promising for therapeutic exploitation. We want to build on these results, harnessing mechanistic insight into DNA metabolism in the search for effective cancer treatments, which remains a major health issue. Mechanistically, we will establish the mechanisms of cell death upon DNA2-GEN1 and MUS81 abrogation in cancer cells. Translationally, our primary goal is to provide proof-of-principle that effector-level inhibition of the replication stress response will be a feasible anti-cancer strategy in future. Support by the Academy of Medical Sciences Professorship Scheme will be critical to implement this translational arm of our research in the UK and to pursue our ambitious strategy of marrying research into fundamental chromosome maintenance processes with direct assessment of novel insight for impact in disease settings. Since replication stress is widespread in cancers, exploiting replication stress for targeted therapy is not tied to a particular cancer type, giving our findings far-reaching relevance.

298	Dr Veronique Miron	University of Edinburgh	Centre for Inflammation Research	2015-06-01	2020-05-31	Targeting activin receptors as a novel approach to promote myelin repair in the central nervous system	I propose to test the contribution of activin receptor signalling to oligodendrocyte progenitor (OPC) responses during myelin production/repair in the central nervous system. Aim 1: to characterize activin receptor expression in vivo by immunofluorescence during developmental myelination and remyelination (both toxin- and immune-based lesion models). Aim 2: to determine the activin receptor subtype driving OPC responses relevant for myelination and remyelination, by CRISPR-mediated genomic deletion of specific receptor subtypes and analysis of OPC responses in vitro and following transplant into myelinating and remyelinating ex vivo brain explants, and receptor-specific pathway activation assessed by phospho-antibody microarrays. Aim3: to test effects of additional ligands either known to, or predicted to, bind activin receptors on OPCs, first by assessing expression during myelination/remyelination in vivo and then screening detected ligands for their potential to stimulate OPC responses using high throughput image acquisition and signalling pathway activation as above. Aim 4: to elucidate contribution of activin receptor signalling in OPCs to myelination and remyelination, by generating a constitutive and inducible OPC-specific conditional knockout for the activin receptor required for all activin receptor signalling, respectively, and crossing to reporter mice for analysis of knockout OPCs. OPC responses and myelination will be analyzed by immunofluorescence and ultrastructural analysis. Sufficiency of activin receptor stimulation in driving remyelination will also be tested by activin receptor ligand supplementation to demyelinated brain explants (to delineate effective concentrations) and in vivo to focal lesions of the central nervous system. I envisage that this research will impact therapeutic strategies to promote myelin repair in human myelin disorders such as multiple sclerosis to decrease clinical impairments, by targeting activin receptors on OPCs.

299	Professor Stephen Jackson	University of Cambridge	None	2017-06-01	2022-06-01	Genetic and functional interactions in the mammalian DNA-damage response	DNA in our cells is frequently subject to a wide array of molecularly-distinct forms of damage. To cope with this, life has evolved multiple DNA repair and associated processes, collectively termed the DNA-damage response (DDR). While considerable progress has been made in identifying DDR proteins and their regulators, much remains to be learned about how they operate and are controlled. Building on our successful proof-of-concept studies, we will carry out genome-wide and focused genetic screens via state-of-the-art CRISPR-Cas9 approaches and haploid-cell based chemical mutagenesis. Together with ensuing validation and mechanistic studies, the proposed research has the following interconnected goals: • To identify novel genetic and functional relationships between DDR genes/proteins, and between these and other cellular components, thereby providing fundamental insights into how mammalian cells respond to DNA damage and defining how such responses are controlled and coordinated. • To establish how defects and deregulation of certain DDR processes affect cellular sensitivity and resistance to established and emerging cancer therapies, and to explore the potential clinical relevance of these affects. • To expand our knowledge of how DDR processes are affected by protein post-translational modifications, particularly ubiquitylation and phosphorylation.

There are currently no treatments to cure or even to slow the course of these diseases. In this proposal, we aim to determine the molecular mechanisms by which disease-causing variants give rise to neurodegeneration in HSP. We will generate the world’s first in vivo models of HSP which endogenously express patient-specific gene variants via CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in Drosophila. By integrating disparate genetic, proteomic and imaging analyses of these novel models, we will identify how HSP-causing variants alter protein expression, localisation and interaction. Furthermore, we will establish the clinical relevance of identified mechanisms by studying disease-causing variants in human cellular models of HSP. The synergistic findings from fly and human models of HSP will greatly enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning these neurodegenerative disorders. In the future, the models generated through this proposal will provide: 1) valuable investigative resources for studying the cellular events underlying neurodegenerative disease and 2) a unique method in which to screen for innovative therapeutic approaches for these devastating disorders.

301	Dr David Tumbarello	University of Southampton	None	2017-05-02	2019-05-02	Investigating the mechanisms of Parkin-mediated mitophagy	Determining how cells maintain homeostasis under times of stress is vital to understanding a wide-range of disorders, from neurodegenerative diseases to cardiomyopathies. Autophagy is a catabolic cytosolic pathway that functions to degrade damaged organelles and mis-folded proteins, while providing a protective mechanism under stress. Mitophagy, the selective autophagic pathway for mitochondria limits oxidative stress by degrading damaged mitochondria through a mechanism involving ubiquitylation and recruitment of autophagic machinery. One mechanism of mitophagy, which is dysregulated during Parkinson’s disease, is the PINK1-parkin pathway. In this proposal, we will identify and characterise regulators of parkin which facilitate its recruitment to mitochondria. We will focus on an adaptor protein complex Tollip-Tom1, which has been suggested to be linked to this process, and which functions to regulate trafficking along both the endolysosomal and autophagic pathways. We will utilise microscopic imaging and biochemical assays to dissect the spatiotemporal regulation of parkin-mediated mitophagy following targeted loss of function of Tom1 and Tollip. In addition, we will utilise CRISPR-Cas9 technology, coupled to cDNA reconstitution experiments, and primary patient-derived fibroblasts to understand mechanisms of parkin recruitment following mitochondrial damage. The outcomes will provide crucial mechanisms of how cells regulate PINK1-parkin mediated mitophagy in order to maintain their health.	Wellcome Trust	Seed Award in Science	99277.0	GBP

This process is characterized by an antagonism between variation and stability. On the one hand, development is a tightly controlled process; tissues need to be specified at the right time, at the correct spatial position, and with a defined size. On the other hand, regulation should not be too rigid, since embryos need to adjust to environmental perturbations and correct errors caused by noisy gene expression. We will study variation and stability during pattern formation in the zebrafish heart. We seek to understand the origin of embryo-to-embryo variability as well as robustness against perturbation. The zebrafish heart is a powerful model system for studying variability, since heart positioning is inverted along the left/right axis in 5-10% of wildtype embryos. We aim to identify the mechanism underlying variability in heart positioning and understand its function. To this end, we will combine two innovative approaches: Tomo-seq, a novel method for spatially-resolved transcriptomics developed by the applicant; and single-molecule FISH, a technique that allows absolute quantification of gene expression in single cells. To expand our study of embryo-to-embryo variability beyond gene expression analysis, we will optimize a method for massively parallel single-cell lineage tracing based on CRISPR-Cas. This novel approach will allow us to study embryo-to-embryo variability in developmental lineage specification on the single cell level. We will use this strategy to systematically explore the corrective capacity of the zebrafish heart upon perturbation of progenitor cell pools, and to determine which mechanisms for error correction are activated in the embryo. These quantitative experiments will provide unprecedented insight into variability and robustness during development. The concepts developed here will also be relevant for improving our understanding of variable outcomes in human disease.	European Research Council	Starting Grant	1499883.0	EUR

Rational design of industrial microbes centres on modifications of genes with known roles in the production pathway of interest. However, genes that are unrelated to the production pathway are also known to substantially impact productivity. To date there are no methods that allow the prediction of such distal genes on a rational basis. Effects of distal genes are indirect, and mediated through regulatory interactions between metabolites and proteins, most of which are currently unknown even in the well-studied microbe Escherichia coli. The lack of knowledge of metabolite-protein interactions thus effectively prohibits systematic exploration of distal regulatory relationships, with the consequence that models used to predict metabolic engineering targets are severely limited and rarely applied in industrial biotechnology. Previously, we used small-scale metabolic models and metabolomics to infer metabolite-protein interactions in specific pathways. In this project we propose a novel genome-wide endeavor to map metabolite-protein interactions across the entire metabolic network. For this purpose, we will use the recently developed CRISPR interference system to quantitatively perturb >900 single metabolic genes in E. coli. Combining the metabolomics data of these >900 gene perturbations with a genome-scale metabolic model will enable us to infer functionally relevant metabolite-protein interactions. Finally, we will apply this knowledge to the model-guided metabolic engineering of superior E. coli strains. Specifically, we want E. coli to cease growth upon induction and focus all its metabolic resources towards synthesis of succinic acid. This controlled uncoupling of growth from overproduction on a rational basis will break new grounds in metabolic engineering and opens up novel applications in industrial biotechnology.

Patients with advanced CKD mostly die from sudden cardiac death and recurrent heart failure due to premature cardiac aging with hypertrophy, fibrosis, and capillary rarefaction. I have recently identified the long sought key cardiac myofibroblast progenitor population, an emerging breakthrough that carries the potential to develop novel targeted therapeutics. Genetic ablation of these Gli1  perivascular progenitors ameliorates fibrosis, cardiac hypertrophy and rescues left-ventricular function. I propose that Gli1  cells are critically involved in all major pathophysiologic changes in cardiac aging and uremic cardiomyopathy including fibrosis, hypertrophy and capillary rarefaction. I will perform state of the art genetic fate tracing, ablation and in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing experiments to untangle their complex mechanism of activation and communication with endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes promoting fibrosis, capillary rarefaction, cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. To identify novel druggable targets I will utilize new mouse models that allow comparative transcript and proteasome profiling assays of these critical myofibroblast precusors in homeostasis, aging and premature aging in CKD. Novel assays with immortalized cardiac Gli1  cells will allow high throughput screens to identify uremia associated factors of cell activation and inhibitory compounds to facilitate the development of novel therapeutics. This ambitious interdisciplinary project requires the expertise of chemists, physiologists, biomedical researchers and physician scientists to develop novel targeted therapies in cardiac remodeling during aging and CKD. The passion that drives this project results from a simple emerging hypothesis: It is possible to treat heart failure and sudden cardiac death in aging and CKD by targeting perivascular myofibroblast progenitors.

We are interested in spacer acquisition in the CRISPR-Cas system and have shown how Cas1-Cas2 captures foreign DNA. We plan to solve the structure of the complete integrase complex to understand how it binds target DNA and inserts protospacers into the CRISPR locus. Cas4 is also involved in spacer acquisition in some CRISPR types. We will identify the structural basis of acquisition in Cas4-containing systems and elucidate the roles of Cas4. In addition, we plan to identify the unknown RNase that trims crRNA from its 3’-end, and address the molecular mechanism of RNA-induced silencing in type III systems. Our previous study suggested that bacteria have a DNA interference system. We demonstrated the molecular mechanism of DNA-guided DNA interference using structural and functional studies. We will now focus on the guide DNA biogenesis pathway. Ago also has potential to be a genome editing tool due to its sequence-specific DNA cleavage activity. We will optimize the TtAgo sequence to screen for mutants which have high cleavage activity at 37°C.	Wellcome Trust	International Research Scholar Award	500404.17	USD

Understanding the genetics of cholangiocarcinoma has been hampered by relatively small sample sizes, where whole exome sequencing (WES) has yielded a broad mutational profile that does not provide a standout mutational signature that can be targeted therapeutically. In this study, we aim to use computational tools to conduct a combined analysis of 413 cholangiocarcinoma WES datasets. We will then define driver mutations from this dataset using algorithms that predict the likelihood of a mutation being oncogenic. These computationally derived mutations will be used to conduct a forward genetic screen in bile duct organoids using Cas9/CRISPR, the expectation is that neutral mutations will be filtered out and we will to derive a list of impacting, functional oncogenic mutations. This combination of in silico and in vitro methodology will determine bona fide oncogenes from a highly-triaged list of candidate mutations. Whilst we are focused on cholangiocarcinoma, this methodology will be important in identifying oncogenes in other rare cancers or cancers which have diverse mutational spectra.

Platelets, through the interaction with lymphatic endothelial cells, lead to the separation of the blood and lymphatic vasculatures throughout embryonic development and into adulthood. However it is not understood how this interaction maintains the separation of the two vasculatures and how platelets guide lymphatic endothelial cell behaviour. Previous research has focused on the generation of mouse models which lack the versatility available from other model organisms such as Zebrafish. We have identified Zebrafish orthologues of the key molecules involved in the separation of the lymphatic and blood vasculatures and have demonstrated that they form complexes with other membrane associated proteins.We will develop a Zebrafish model to determine the mechanistic basis underlying the separation of the blood and lymphatic vasculatures. We hypothesize that membrane complexes regulate the cellular behaviour of lymphatic endothelial cells. Complex members will be identified using biological mass spectrometry and their spatial distribution quantified using two-colour dSTORM super resolution microscopy. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology will introduce gene disruptions and mutations into the Zebrafish genome allowing the mechanistic basis underlying the separation of the blood and lymphatic vasculatures in vivo to be determined.This proposal will lead to mechanistic insight underlying the separation of the lymphatic and blood vasculatures by platelets and will develop a model with the translational potential to assess the impact of therapeutic compounds on the separation of these two vasculatures in vivo.

We contribute to a new strategy by genetically modifying insect vectors, sandflies (Lutzomyia longipalpis) and triatomine bugs (Rhodnius prolixus), leading eventually to transgenic insects resistant to disease agents. We will use two different transgenic approaches, piggyBac and CRISPR-Cas9. PiggyBac is a method for semi random insertion of exogenous DNA into the genome. CRISPR-Cas9 is a new and highly targeted method to manipulate genes in a manner not previously possible. • Microinjection of insect embryos with piggyBac plasmids to obtain insects expressing fluorescent markers for subsequent CRISPR-Cas9 knockout experiments facilitating easy monitoring of outcomes. • Knockout of fluorescent markers (above), using CRISPR-Cas9 constructs, demonstrating that system components are functional and that we can precisely target genes of interest. • Knockout of endogenous genes by CRISPR-Cas 9 that are non-essential or important in sustaining infection in insect vectors. • Insertion and expression of exogenous DNA (fluoresence markers) using CRISPR-Cas9 harnessing homology directed repair facilitating inheritance to offspring at levels above mendelian inheritance (gene drive). Pilot outputs offer real prospects for developing powerful approaches of interrupting disease transmission.	Wellcome Trust	Seed Award in Science	75106.0	GBP

Established very early in human development, body weight regulation is brain-governed by the hypothalamus. Consequently, genetic variants acting by disrupting hypothalamic function lead to severe obesity. However, the manner in which these variants contribute to obesity via exerting neurodevelopmental and molecular changes has been difficult to study since human brain tissue is inaccessible. Historically, rodent models have extensively contributed to our understanding of energy homeostasis, but they carry inherent limitations due to inter-species differences in brain structure and physiology, as well as gene sequences. Therefore, development of human study systems for disease modelling is an important complementary approach to animal and patient studies aimed at investigating human obesity. We propose to use several novel methodologies: precise genome engineering with CRISPR/Cas9 in stem cells, 2D hypothalamic cultures, as well as 3D brain organoids, to: (1) generate physiologically relevant cellular and tissue models of human genetic obesity; (2) investigate neurodevelopmental aspects of the disease; (3) utilise the models to study molecular mechanisms leading to obesity.

The NEAT1 isoforms, NEAT1_1 and NEAT1_2, are expressed from the same promoter but undergo differential processing and play non-overlapping and sometimes even opposite roles in cellular (patho)physiology. NEAT1 isoforms are promising therapeutic targets, however, their contribution to the human pathology remains poorly understood. This is largely due to the lack of adequate tools, both biological and pharmacological, for their differential analysis. The aim of this project is twofold: to generate reporter cell lines allowing quantitative analysis of NEAT1 isoforms; and to develop and validate a cellular assay for identification of NEAT1 modulators. Two strategies, both using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, will be applied to create stable reporter cell lines for monitoring NEAT1 isoforms in living cells. In the first setting, endogenous NEAT1 transcripts will be fluorescently labelled using either the MS2 system or the RNA aptamer Spinach2. The second strategy will involve a protein labelling approach, where endogenous proteins SFPQ and NONO, which form a heterodimer upon NEAT1_2 interaction, will be tagged with fragments of a self-complementing fluorescent reporter. One reporter line will be selected as a platform to develop an assay for medium-throughput identification of molecules targeting NEAT1 isoforms. Finally, a proof-of-principle screen using a commercial library of physiologically active compounds will be performed to validate this cell-based assay. Thus, this project will yield scalable tools for NEAT1-focused research and drug discovery.	The Academy of Medical Sciences	Springboard Round 4	99293.0	GBP
311	Dr Anne Pesenacker	University College London	Institute of Immunity and Transplantation	2018-07-01	2023-06-30	Balancing co-stimulatory versus co-inhibitory receptors to control the function of Tregs in autoimmunity	CD4+FOXP3+ Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are crucial for maintaining immune tolerance. However, we still do not fully understand how they keep the immune system in check, or why they fail to function in autoimmune diseases, such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Although modern therapies have improved outcomes in autoimmunity, they are not always effective and often come with severe side effects. A better understanding of how Tregs are altered in autoimmunity will lead to better therapies. T cell activity is dependent on co-receptors, and targeting specific co-receptors is a successful approach for immunotherapy. In preliminary studies I found that Tregs in JIA synovial fluid (SF) express high levels of co-receptors, and that the microenvironment is rich in their ligands. Thus, I hypothesize that altered co-receptor signalling in Tregs could contribute to their dysfunction in autoimmunity. My research will focus on the co-receptor pair CD226 and TIGIT: two co-receptors highly expressed on Tregs but with poorly characterized function in these cells. I will establish signalling, receptor-receptor and receptor-ligand interaction models and study their effects on Treg function. I will generate T cell and Treg lines with specific knockout (CRISPR-Cas) and overexpression (lentiviral) of CD226 and/or TIGIT to delineate receptor-specific roles. I will assess whether Treg signalling via CD226 and TIGIT is altered in autoimmunity by utilizing SF samples from inflamed JIA joints. Additionally, I will assess the impact of mutations in the CD226/TIGIT pathway, or accessory molecules, found in primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) presenting with autoimmune features. Lastly, I will test whether modulating the CD226/TIGIT pathway in patient-derived Tregs is a suitable therapeutic approach to restore immune-balance in autoimmunity. Determining how Treg function is controlled by co-receptors will increase our understanding of immune tolerance and may lead to new drug targets for JIA and other autoimmune conditions.

LATOS	Medical University of Vienna	None	2019-05-01	2022-04-30	Role of ARID1A in endometrial cancer organoid model	Endometrial cancer is the most prevalent gynaecological malignancy in developed countries and the incidence rates are steadily increasing. Endometrial cancer is associated with a number of mutations including those in components of the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway, in KRAS and in ARID1A. ARID1A is a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex and although ARID1A is the most frequent target of mutations in endometrial tumours, the mechanism by which its inactivation promotes tumorigenesis is unclear, not least due to the lack of a suitable experimental model. Recently, we and others have established 3D endometrial organoid cultures that faithfully recapitulate the architecture, expression patterns, hormonal responsiveness and secretory abilities of the in vivo endometrial epithelium. We propose to employ this system to elucidate the function of ARID1A in human endometrium and its role in initiation and progression of endometrial cancer. Using loss of function experiments, expression analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we aim to identify the set of genes directly regulated by ARID1A in human endometrial epithelium. To gain novel insights into the ARID1A mode of action we seek to determine ARID1A protein interactors using immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. We expect to identify transcription factors that recruit ARID1A (as part of the SWI/SNF complex) to specific genomic loci as well as endometrium-specific subunits of the SWI/SNF complex. In addition, we will test the hypothesis that oestrogen signalling contributes to progression of the ARID1A-deficient endometrial tumours. Moreover, we aim to generate an organoid model of endometrial cancer by introduction of mutation in ARID1A, KRAS and/or PIKCA3 genes using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. We will follow effects of these mutations on niche factor dependency, organoid growth and tumorigenicity upon transplantation into mice and in the context of high estrogen signalling. Overall, here we propose to use a unique, comprehensive approach by combing mechanistic advances with functional assays in a novel cancer model system to understand the role of ARID1A in endometrial biology and malignancy.

PD pathogenesis is driven, at least in part, by defects in proteostasis and mitochondrial function, leading to degeneration of dopaminergic axons and neuronal death. Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) such as GDNF can protect and restore dopaminergic axons. However, attempts to deploy NTFs ectopically in therapy models, or to increase proteostasis and mitochondrial function, have met with only limited success. I hypothesize that instead of ectopic application, over-expression of relevant pathways restricted to physiologically appropriate cells provides a potent therapeutic approach to treat PD. I have made significant progress toward this goal by targeting the 3’UTR in the mouse Gdnf gene, thereby increasing expression levels without affecting the gene’s spatiotemporal expression pattern. Using this approach I have shown that elevation of endogenous GDNF levels protects mice from experimentally induced PD. Unlike ectopic GDNF application, it causes no side effects. Importantly, I have established that GDNF levels can be elevated by 3’UTR targeting in adulthood, suggesting that this strategy could be applied in humans late in life. I will use 3’UTR targeting to study the therapeutic potential of overexpressing endogenous genes, using transgenics and CRISPR-Cas9‒mediated 3’UTR editing in adult mice. First, I will increase the expression of NTFs in adult mice with experimentally induced PD. Next, I will upregulate genes important in mitochondrial function and proteostasis and test whether concurrently upregulating endogenous NTFs is a viable approach for treating PD. Third, I will use 3’UTR targeting to create a mouse model of PD in which alpha-synuclein is overexpressed, for better validation of my therapeutic strategy. Collectively, these experiments should establish proof of concept for a revolutionary, safe and effective treatment for PD.	European Research Council	Consolidator Grant	1999987.0	EUR

Before implantation, the hatched ungulate blastocyst must undergo dramatic morphological changes characterized by cell differentiation, proliferation and migration processes leading to the development of extra-embryonic membranes, the appearance of a flat embryonic disc and gastrulation. This prolonged preimplantation development is termed conceptus elongation and deficiencies on this process constitute the most frequent cause of reproductive failures in ungulates, including the 4 most relevant mammalian livestock species in Europe. The purpose of this project is to elucidate the factors involved in conceptus elongation by gene editing and in vitro culture approaches. A first objective will be to identify key genes involved in differentiation processes by RNA-seq analysis of different embryo derivatives from bovine conceptuses at different developmental stages. Subsequently, the function of some of the genes identified as well as others known to play a crucial role in mouse development or putatively involved in embryo-maternal interactions will be assessed. For this aim, bovine embryos in which a candidate gene has been ablated (KO) will be generated by CRISPR and transferred to recipient females to assess in vivo the function of such particular gene on conceptus development. A second set of experiments pursue the development of an in vitro system for conceptus elongation that would bypass the requirement for in vivo experiments. For this aim we will perform metabolomics and proteomics analyses of bovine uterine fluid at different stages and will use these data to rationally develop a culture system able to sustain conceptus development. The knowledge generated by this project will serve to develop strategies to enhance farming profitability by reducing embryonic loss and to understand Developmental Biology questions unanswered by the mouse model.

Mouse TSCs are a well-established model system that can be manipulated in vitro to interrogate molecular mechanisms controlling trophoblast differentiation. Pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia and HELLP (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count) Syndrome are particularly linked to defective formation and behaviour of invasive endovascular trophoblasts that enhance maternal blood supply to the foetus. Our preliminary analyses (see Case for Support) suggest formation of this essential trophoblast subtype is heavily influenced by BAF complex chromatin remodelling factors. I recently showed the chromatin landscape undergoes widespread changes during TSC differentiation. We will continue to exploit mouse TSCs to understand how BAF chromatin remodelling complex bromodomain(BRD)-containing proteins BRG1, BRM and BAF180 influence the chromatin landscape and thus trophoblast cell fate and behaviour by: 1) Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene knockout and a highly potent and specific small molecule inhibitor specifically targeting BRG1, BRM and BAF180 BRDs, coupled with RNA-seq and qRT-PCR profiling of well characterized markers of individual trophoblast subtypes; 2) Profiling BRG1, BRM and BAF180 chromatin binding locations using ChIP-seq in control and BRD-attenuated trophoblasts; 3) Profiling BAF complex-dependent chromatin accessibility using ATAC-seq on control, BRG1, BRM, BAF180 and BRG1;BRM CRISPR knockout and BRD-inhibited trophoblasts; 4) Determining the composition of BRG1-, BRM- and BAF180-containing protein complexes in wild type trophoblasts using co-IP with mass spectrometry. This will provide valuable insights into trophoblast subtypes controlled by BAF complexes, how they control use of cis-regulatory sequences and their molecular mechanism of action.

The disease is marked by the presence of extracellular plaques - composed of aggregated amyloid-ß peptide (Aß) - and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) - consisting of aggregates of abnormally hyperphosphorylated Tau protein. Recent studies showed that Aß and abnormal Tau protein may interact and have synergistic toxic effects, leading to neuronal death in AD, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Although Tau was primarily described as an axonal protein stabilizing microtubule function and assembly, new findings obtained in the laboratory of Professor Jürgen Götz at the University of Queensland (Australia) identified a dendritic function of this protein that seems to be crucial in mediating Aß toxicity at the postsynaptic compartment. Indeed, Tau is required for the targeting of FYN, a Src kinase widely expressed in the hippocampus, to dendritic spines. FYN phosphorylates the GluN2B subunit of the NMDA receptor, which is essential for recruiting the postsynaptic density (95kD) protein (PSD95). This enhances the stability of the receptor complex at the synaptic membrane, which boosts the excitotoxic signaling induced by the presence of Aß. Interestingly, in absence of Tau, the targeting/clustering of FYN is massively reduced in the dendritic spines and, vice versa, when tau is pseudo-phosphorylated at distinct phosphorylation sites (AT180 - 12E8 - PHF1 - S396/S404), targeting of Tau and FYN to spines is markedly increased. Together, this identifies a cross-talk between the two molecules which we intend to further dissect in the present proposal.HYPOTHESIS: Thus, based on the previous and preliminary data obtained in the laboratory of Prof. Götz, the overarching hypothesis of the project is that the subcellular localization, trafficking and clustering of FYN and Tau are tightly regulated in a physiological and pathological context (AD).AIMS: The specific aims of the present study are to prove our hypothesis and to enhance our understanding of the endogenous regulation of Tau and FYN trafficking to the dendritic spine. For this approach, a combination of technics (biochemical, pharmacological as well as super-resolution microscopy) established in the Götz laboratory, will be used to identify the mechanisms underlying the targeting of Tau and FYN at the spine, under physiological and pathological (AD) conditions. Especially, we will use novel gene-edited mouse strains created in the Götz laboratory with the TALEN / CRISPR technology, introducing a photo-convertible mEOS2 tag in-frame into the carboxy-terminus of either the Tau-encoding gene or the FYN-encoding gene. The fluorescence emitted by Tau-mEOS2 and FYN-mEOS2 will be analyzed using super resolution microscopy technics, including the single particle tracking photo-activated localization microscopy (sptPALM).Using these tools, we would like to pursue two main objectives as part of this program:Specific Aim 1: To determine the mobility of FYN and Tau in the somato-dendritic domain and spines: i) under physiological conditions; ii) after neuronal activation and; iii) in the presence of Aß.Specific Aim 2: To determine whether Tau controls FYN clustering (i.e. the formation of nanoclusters).IMPACT: The current approach opens the opportunity to dissect a novel fundamental mechanism and identifies how the two key molecules in AD, Aß and Tau, interact via FYN to exert their toxic effects. It uses state-of-the-art technology and has ramifications for additional neurodegenerative diseases with protein aggregation, as well as for the role Tau and FYN have in a physiological context and the identification of new therapeutic targets for the treatment of AD.

By contrast, some lower vertebrates, such as zebrafish, can perfectly reconstruct their damaged organs, such as appendages, heart, retina and spinal cord. Little is known about biological factors that permit or suppress the natural ability of organ regeneration. Our goal is to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms that generate new cells for fin and heart regeneration in zebrafish. We will focus on dedifferentiation processes that transform mature cells at the site of injury into a progenitor cell pool, called the blastema. An understanding of blastema formation and regulation both in the fin and heart will elucidate common principles of the regenerative machinery. On the other hand, we will investigate the factors stimulating cardiac cell proliferation and transient scar deposition after heart infarction. This undertaking will demand the use of existing methods, as well as developing novel research tools in adult zebrafish, such as the inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system technology. A conceptual and molecular deciphering of mechanisms of natural regeneration in lower vertebrates will help to build a foundation for regenerative medicine.

The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene is a major oncogene in NB, and ALK activating mutations or wild-type (wt) expression are associated with poor clinical outcome. The implication of ALK-wt, and the ALK activating mutations, ALK-F1174L, and ALK-R1275Q, in NC progenitor fate and neuroblastomagenesis was previously investigated using immortalized murine neural crest progenitor cells (NCPC), MONC-1 and JoMa-1. In vivo studies by orthotopic (adrenal gland) implantations reveled that MONC-1 cells could generate various tumor types, such as NB, osteo/chondrosarcoma, and undifferentiated tumors. In contrast, MONC-1 cells expressing ALK-F1174L only produced highly aggressive undifferentiated NC cell-derived tumors, similarly to JoMa1 cells overexpressing ALK-wt, or activating ALK mutants. JoMa1-ALK-derived tumors expressed high levels of various stem cells (SC) and NC stem cell (NCSC) associated markers, confirming their stem-like and phenotypes, and suggesting an ALK-mediated impairment of NCPC differentiation potential in vivo.The specific objectives of the present project are to investigate the functional role of ALK and its downstream pathways in the control of NCPC differentiation potential and fate, as well as to elucidate the involvement of activated ALK in the maturation of the sympathoadrenal lineage and in NB differentiation. Using ALK-transduced NCPC cell lines described above in combination with specific ALK and ALK signaling pathways inhibitors, we will investigate the influence of activated ALK signaling on NCPC differentiation capacity and fate in vitro. To increase our knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms and transcriptional controllers involved in ALK-mediated blockage of NCPC differentiation in vivo, we plan to investigate the global epigenetic patterns and the expression profiles associated to NB orthotopic tumors-derived from MONC1 cells as compared to undifferentiated tumors-derived from MONC-1-ALK-F cells. The role of putative ALK target genes, Myc and Twist1/2, or of newly identified key transcriptional regulators in the control of NCPC differentiation will be explored by means of specific inhibitors and/or silencing strategies through CRISPR/Cas9. In addition, a special focus will be dedicated to the involvement of ALK deregulated activation in the differentiation and maturation of normal sympathetic neurons and adrenal chromaffin cells, using ALK-mutants knock-in mice, as well as in NB cell differentiation potential using ALK overexpressing NB cell lines. Moreover, clinical NB samples will be examined to identify a possible correlation between ALK expression level and/or localization, and neublastic cell differentiation status within individual tumors.This project will be performed within an established collaborative international team of experts in NC development (Prof. L. Sommer and Dr O. Shakhova), in the molecular genetics of NB (Drs I. Janoueix-Lerosey and G. Schleiermacher), in NB orthotopic modeling (Dr J.-M. Joseph), in NB histopathology (Dr M. Peuchmaur), and in epigenetic regulation of solid tumors (Dr N. Riggi). This study should provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms responsible for dysfunctional NC cell maturation responsible for NB development, and may contribute to the identification of new therapeutic options.

319	Arnold von Eckardstein	University of Zurich	Institut für Klinische Chemie Universitätsspital Zürich	2015-06-01	2018-05-31	Role of Scavenger Receptor BI and Endothelial Lipase in the Transendothelial Transport of High Density Lipoproteins	Background: High density lipoproteins (HDL) and their main protein constituent and precursor, apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), exert several atheroprotective actions within the vascular wall, notably the removal of cholesterol from macrophage foam cells for reverse transport to the liver. However, it is little understood how HDL and apoA-I pass the endothelial barriers to reach and leave the arterial intima with the lipid laden macrophages. We have previously found that aortic endothelial cells bind, internalize and resecrete apoA-I and HDL by processes that are modulated by the ATP binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1, respectively, as well as the scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI), endothelial lipase (EL), and the ectopic F0F1-ATPase/P2Y12 axis. We have not yet unravelled the mechanisms by which these proteins contribute to endothelial transcytosis of HDL. For this proposal we will focus on the role of SR-BI and EL.Working hypothesis: SR-BI and EL are HDL binding proteins that mediate the internalization of HDL either directly as an endocytic receptor (notably the SR-BII splice variant of SCARB1) or indirectly by transducing signals to an endocytic machinery (SR-BI via its PDZ or cholesterol sensing domains) or generating signaling molecules (EL by generating lysophosphatidylcholines or exposing S1P). Specific aims: In two subprojects we want to answer the following two questions: 1. How do SR-BI and EL regulate the internalization and trafficking of HDL through endothelial cells? 2. Do EL and SR-BI modulate transendothelial transport of HDL in vivo? Experimental design: For amswering the first question we will generate human aortic and lymphatic endothelial cell lines (HAEC and HLEC) with knock-outs of the SCARB1 and LIPG genes using the CRISPR/Cas system. The SCARB1 ko cell line will be knocked-in with either of the two isoforms SR-BI or SR-BII or with two SR-BI mutants which lack the signaling PDZ domain or the cholesterol sensing activity. The LIPG1 ko cells will be knocked-in with either wild type EL or an enzymatically inactive EL mutant. After confirming the endothelial phenotype the individual cell lines as well as the effective knock-outs and knock-ins, the cells will be analyzed for their function to bind, internalize and transport HDL per se and after complementation with signaling molecules (EL knock-out and knock-in cell lines). These biochemical experiments will be complemented by fluorescence microscopy studies to unravel any erroneous trafficking of HDL. The cells will also be characterized for other responses to HDL, notably in nitric oxide production, VCAM-1 expression, apoptosis, endothelial repair, and phosphorylation of signaling molecules. The second question will be approached by comparing the kinetics of radiocatively labeled HDL and control proteins in SCARB1 ko mice, LIPG ko mice and wild type mice. We will inject radioiodinated HDL, albumin or LDL into the tail vein to monitor its appearance in the arterial wall and peritoneal cave as well as into the peritoneal cave or foot pads to monitor its appearance in plasma. We will also use two photon live microscopy to study the kinetics by which fluorescence labeled HDL and control proteins injected intravenously and subcutaneously appear in the interstial space and microvessels of the skin, respectively. Expected value: Our project will answer a key question on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, namely how HDL particles enter and leave the vascular wall. This process is a pre-requisite for the mediation of anti-atherogenic functions of HDL and therefore a potential target for anti-atherosclerotic drug therapy.

One type of chronic pain, neuropathic pain, is expected to affect more than 75 million of people worldwide. Neuropathic pain (NP) as defined by the IASP is a “Pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system”. This clinical syndrome may appear in the context of many different alterations of the peripheral and central nervous system; from radiculopathy induced by disk hernia, traumatic or compressive (tumors) nerve injuries, toxic, metabolic or infectious conditions (chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, AIDS-related pain, and so on) to multiple sclerosis, stroke or Parkinson disease. Neuropathic pain is associated with hyperexcitability of the central and the peripheral nervous systems, resulting in ongoing pain, allodynia (innocuous stimuli that become painful), hyperalgesia (exaggerated and prolonged pain response in response to noxious stimuli) and negative symptoms such as hypoalgesia. Increased neuronal activity can explain both spontaneous and exaggerated stimulus-evoked pain. In the nervous system, the excitability is mainly carried by voltage-gated sodium channels (Navs) that are responsible for the upstroke of action potentials. Navs are heteromeric glycosylated protein composed of a large pore-forming a-subunit and small ß-auxiliary subunits. Nine genes encode for distinct channel isoforms (Nav1.1 to Nav1.9) and all, except Nav1.4 and Nav1.5, are expressed in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) nociceptive neurons. In these neurons, Nav1.7 has been found to be the most expressed TTX-sensitive isoform compared to Nav1.1, Nav1.2, Nav1.3 and Nav1.6, and is coexpressed with the two TTX resistant isoforms, Nav1.8 and Nav1.9.In neuropathic pain, accumulation of Nav1.7, Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 was reported in the primary afference. In addition to this acquired pain syndrome, the contribution of Nav1.7 in inherited pain disorders has been recurrently reported. Congenital insensitivity to pain due to loss-of-function of the channel were first described in 2006 and since then other mutations have been reported. On the other side of the spectrum, multiple gain-of-functions mutations were shown to be associated with two exaggerated pain sensitivity pathologies, namely inherited erythromyelagia (IEM) and paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (PEPD). More recently, studies also highlighted a role for Nav1.7 in idiopathic small-fiber neuropathy (I-SFN); nearly 30% of patients suffering from this pathology presented a gain-of function mutation in Nav1.7. Small fiber peripheral neuropathy is a type of peripheral neuropathy that occurs from damage to C-fibers and A-d fibers that are the small unmyelinated and thinly myelinated peripheral nerve fibers belonging to nociceptive neurons. Since then, similar gain-of-function mutations in Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 have also been reported. I-SFN is not only accompanied with neuronal hyperexcitability but is also associated with axonal degeneration and neuronal death. Now what is hypothesized, but remains to be demonstrated is whether the hyperexcitability is responsible for the axonal degeneration. In vitro experiments confirmed that 1) these mutations induced modification of the biophysical properties of the different Navs in cell expression system and 2) led to DRG neurons hyperexcitability. These two combined approaches however present limitations. HEK cells do not express endogenous Navs proteins and are thus widely used to characterize the effect of a mutation on a particular canal biophysical properties. However the modulation of activity of the channel might significantly vary between different cell types and HEK cells do not necessarily reflect DRG neurons. Another limitation of cell expression system is that HEK cells no not express potassium channel, consequently the effect of these mutations on the overall cellular excitability cannot be investigated under current clamp mode (recording of action potentials is not possible). To study the effect of mutation on cellular excitability, another approach using primary culture of mice nociceptive neurons transfected with human Nav1.7 containing the specific mutation is commonly used. The main limitation of this approach is that the mutated human cDNA is expressed together with the two wild-type mice alleles; thus there is an interspecies gene coexpression and a contamination of the mutated cDNA with the endogenous allele. Another approach to investigate these single mutations of Nav1.7/1.8/1.9 would be to generate knock-in mice harbouring these mutations. But generating such knock-in mice line with the traditional approach is laborious and time consuming and has consequently never been performed in the pain field. It is well-known that upon repetitive stimulation of the primary afference, the input into the central nervous system will be potentiated. The synaptic strength between primary and secondary order neuron is increased, ultimately leading to the hyperexcitability of the dorsal horn nociceptive neurons. This process is referred to as central sensitization, a mechanism first described by Clifford Woolf, and that has been extensively studied since then. Nothing is known on the effect of the gain-of-function mutations of Nav1.7 on mechanisms of central sensitization. It is likely that the increased excitability observed in the periphery will also lead to a strengthening of the spinal cord input.AIMBecause the use of human cell lines and primary nociceptive neuron cultures both show limitations (discussed above) in AIM 1 we plan to investigate the effect of Nav1.7/1.8/1.9 I-SNF mutations on human nociceptor-like neurons excitability. We will also test the hypothesis of whether the hyperexcitability is responsible for the axonal degeneration observed in I-SFN.We will use a two-step experimental approach: 1) we will transdifferentiate human fibroblasts into nociceptor-like neurons and 2) we will use the clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system to generate these mutations in the aforementioned human nociceptive neurons. We will determine whether these mutated human nociceptive neurons also present a hyperexcitable phenotype using electrophysiology (using both voltage- and current-clamp and calcium imaging) similarly to what is observed with HEK293 cells and sensory neurons primary culture. We will then compare the observed electrical pattern with the one obtained from nociceptors derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with these mutations (from Ingemar Merkies, a collaborator of Prof. Woolf). The impact of these mutations on the cellular excitability using this approach will give results that are physiologically closer to what happens in humans and also provide a proof-of-concept that this new experimental approach is relevant. To have better insight on the in vivo effect of Nav1.7/1.8/1.9 I-SNF mutations, in AIM 2 we will also take advantage of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate knock-in mice harboring these mutations and test whether these mice develop I-SNF. We will use optogenetics, a tool that allows a very precise spatiotemporal control of neuronal excitability, to investigate how these mutations modify the cellular excitability of sensory neurons upon exogenous stimulation. In AIM3 we will again take advantage of optogenetics to investigate whether stimulation of nociceptors harbouring Nav1.7/1.8/1.9 I-SNF mutations with blue light strengthen the input into the spinal cord.Finally, as I extensively investigated Nedd4-2 effect on Navs turnover, in AIM 4 I will also use the CRISPR/Cas9 system to mutate this ubiquitin ligase in nociceptors-like human neurons and in mice and test the hypothesis that this leads to an increased neuronal excitability and pain hypersensitivity.

These projects include:1.Nup98/HoxB4 immortalized hematopoietic stem cells.These cells will used to analyze the function of the differentially expressed genes in the 4 EPLM subpopulations. Moreover, we will establish the CRISPR/Cas9 genetic editing system in these HSC’s.2.The transcription factor DuxblWe will decipher the molecular mechanism underlying the apoptosis induction by Duxbl. Moreover, we will analyze the effect of Duxbl silencing on B and T cell development. Especially we will test if this silencing can improve T cell development in preTa deficient mice and B cell development in ?5 deficient mice.3.The interplay of FLT3L and IL-7 in early hematopoietic development.We will perform RNA sequencing on the 4 EPLM subpopulations in order to identify differentially expressed genes.

Tropen und Public Health-Institut	2016-10-01	2019-09-30	Characterization of the interaction network of exported proteins in Plasmodium falciparum	The rational to study the interaction network of exported proteins in Plasmodium falciparum lies in the crucial importance of the export of virulence factors to the surface of infected host cells and other modifications allowing the parasite’s survival in its host cell which are the sole cause of morbidity and mortality.P. falciparum, the deadliest form of malaria, exports during its blood cycle over 10% of its proteome into the host cell leading to major host cell modifications such as presentation of adhesins on the surface or change of membrane rigidity and permeability. Why the parasites need to export such large number of proteins is unknown and their interaction is not understood. Only for a small number of proteins a tentative function was determined and hardly any information on exported proteins in the transmission forms, the gametocytes exist.With this project, we aim to elucidate the dynamic interaction network of exported proteins in P. falciparum and their contribution to morbidity during the entire erythrocytic life cycle including gametocytes. Recent technical advances to genetically manipulate P. falciparum make this project more feasible. Using the CRISPR/CAS9 system we will generate knock out parasites of a number of selected exported proteins including a number of PHIST proteins, which were frequently found in the host cell and for which we have shown that they play an important role in anchoring the virulence factor PfEMP1 to the cytoskeleton. With this system but also the alternative selection linked transfection we will generate inducible knock down clones or introduce endogenous tags. All clones will be used for phenotypical analyses using an array of established and innovative methods (e.g. microsphiltration membrane rigidity measures, electron-microscopy for ultrastructural analyses). Protein-protein interaction will be identified using conventional immuno-precipitations but also the BioID system which introduces a promiscuous biotin ligase, which subsequently allows the identification of biotinylated proteins that were in close proximity of the protein of interest. Potential interactions will be confirmed and validated by various techniques such as NMR, fluorescent polarization experiments, fluorescence cross correlation spectroscopy, or split GFP system.We finally expect to obtain through this project an interaction network that is important for Maurer’s cleft function and transport and fixation of PfMP1 on the erythrocyte surface. In particular, we expect clarification of the function of PHIST proteins and their interaction with host cytoskeleton proteins.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div.

Uncontrolled proliferation and maturation arrest are hallmarks of leukemic blasts, the disease-defining cells. Current therapies mainly focus on the deregulated proliferation of blasts; an alternative therapeutic approach is to correct the differentiation defect of leukemia cells and drive the malignant cells into terminal maturation, as successfully exemplified in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a distinct subtype of AML. The overreaching objective of this proposal is to identify and elucidate new targets for differentiation in AML, with the ultimate goal of clinical translation.Specific aims include identification of new differentiation targets using state-of-the-art CRISPR-Cas screening in AML; validation of novel candidate proteins controlling myeloid maturation in multiple models of AML; and understanding the mechanistic role of new AML differentiation targets. This study will uncover a new group of potential therapeutic targets as prime candidates for drug development that will set the stage for future trials assessing differentiation therapies in AML.

In this proposal we strive to unravel how aberrant assembly of protein-RNA complexes may contribute to ALS neuropathology. For this purpose we will analyse the ability of TDP-43, an RNA-binding protein (RBP) commonly associated with ALS, to assemble on RNA transcripts in complex with additional RBPs. We hypothesise that the low complexity region (LCR) of TDP-43 coordinates binding to other RBPs and thereby promotes cooperative RNA interactions. The aim of our study is to elucidate how the composition of TDP-43/RBP complexes influences its affinity and specificity for different RNA binding sites, and thereby affects processing of neurologically relevant transcripts. The successful completion will address basic questions regarding the formation of RNA-protein complexes, and may also uncover new therapeutic avenues for ALS treatment. Our study will involve generation of isogenic cell lines (HEK Flp-In™ and CRISPR/Cas9-edited iPS cells) that will be used for state-of-the-art interaction studies (BioID, APEX, BLI) and development of a variant iCLIP method to elucidate how and where TDP-43 binds transcripts in disease-relevant models. The results of our studies are likely to strongly impact the fields of ALS and hnRNP biology.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Early Postdoc.Mobility	None	None
325	Julio Cesar Aguila Benitez	University of Berne	None	2016-03-01	2016-05-31	Stem cell biotechnology and microfluidics for transcriptome and proteome analysis of motor neuron axons and somas in health and ALS	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a lethal disease characterized by the loss of motor neurons (MNs) innervating voluntary muscles. ALS can be inherited familial (˜10%) due to mutations in several genes including e.g. superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), the DNA/RNA-binding proteins TDP-43 or FUS and C9ORF72. Animal models of familial ALS have demonstrated that intrinsic events within MNs are crucial for initiation of degeneration. From these models, we also know that the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) are primary affected before the onset of central MN loss. Thus it is likely that communication between muscle and MNs is altered with disease. Signals from MN to muscle (anterograde) and from muscle to MN (retrograde) are key regulators of development, maturation and stability of the NMJ. However, the contributions of MNs and muscle to these processes remain unclear, in particular the roles for retrograde signalling. It is quite well established that local RNA translation in the synapse is important for temporal control of protein synthesis and synaptic plasticity. The synthesis of many synaptic proteins is regulated by mRNA binding proteins including TDP43 and FUS, which are mutated in ALS and have modified subcellular localization. Thus, it seems that distinct changes take place in the axonal and somatodendritic MN compartments with disease. In this collaborative project we aim to unveil those changes by studying a compartmentalized in vitro model of the human NMJ. Using stem cell biotechnology and microfluidics we will develop this in vitro system where MNs and muscle are differentiated from healthy human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) or hiPSCs harbouring ALS-causing mutations in the SOD-1, TDP-43, and FUS genes, respectively. Using the microfluidics devices, MNs and muscle are restricted to different cell compartments and only connect through the motor axons recruited to the muscle side. Transcriptomic and proteomic signatures with this compartmentalized cellular resolution would reveal normal and altered events at the MN soma, axon and muscle levels. However, this approach strongly depends on isogenic hiPSC lines. Patient derived iPSCs and age matched controls cannot be used as different genetic background and unequal differentiation potentials introduce too much variance in the transcriptome and proteome to filter out disease specific alterations.While the Hedlund group has isogenic hiPSC lines for ALS-linked SOD-1 and the Ruepp group recently created isogenic hiPSC lines for ALS-linked FUS there are no isogenic hiPS cells with ALS-linked TDP-43 mutations available. Therefore, we plan during the international short visit to generate hiPS cell lines with ALS-linked TDP-43 mutations using CRISPR/Cas9. The Ruepp group has already established genome editing of hiPS cells and will teach Dr. Aguila Benitez (Hedlund lab) the required techniques. At the same time Dr. Aguila Benitez will help the Ruepp group to set up microfluidics for proteomic profiling from pure axonal preparations of MNs. The aim of this international short visit is to mutually transfer knowledge and materials required to create isogenic healthy and ALS-linked NMJs to address the pathogenic mechanism(s) involved in selective MN degeneration in ALS, and to initiate a long-term collaboration between the partner labs.

In host-parasite systems, one intriguing candidate for a molecular driver of co-evolution is the rather recently discovered “adaptive immune system” of bacterial pathogens, encoded in clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (cas) genes. This project will investigate the dynamics of host-parasite evolution in the natural epizootic caused by the bacterium Mycoplasma gallisepticum in the North American house finch population (Haemorhous mexicanus). Genomic characterization of house finch M. gallisepticum strains revealed patterns of CRISPR evolution that suggest altered phage parasite pressure on the bacteria after the switch from poultry to songbird host in 1994. At the same time, the observed degradation of CRISPR in M. gallisepticum also suggests that CRISPR maintenance might be costly to the evolution of virulence during adaptation to the new bird host, offering an alternative explanation for the apparent loss of CRISPR function. To understand the evolutionary dynamics between house finches and M. gallisepticum we need to establish which of these two evolutionary processes, if any, are the major drivers of the observed changes in the CRISPR-system in Mycoplasma. Thus, the two main goals of this project are to investigate (i) the drivers of CRISPR evolution (i.e. phages) and (ii) the consequences of CRISPR change for functional properties of the Mycobacterium genome that are important for virulence evolution.Currently, the biggest obstacle to addressing these goals is the lack of knowledge concerning the phages involved in the Mycobacterium-finch system. In a first step, I will map the geographic and temporal diversity of phages and bacteria throughout the epizootic in house finches. Then, cross-infection experiments with historical and newly sampled bacterial and phage isolates will provide functional tests of CRISPR variants and reveal co-evolutionary patterns between the phages and the bacteria. In a second step, I will explore the consequences of CRISPR degradation for the Mycoplasma genome by checking for genomic signals of increased virulence known to be associated with “pathogenicity islands”. By connecting the effects of phage diversity on CRISPR evolution in the bacterium with the effects of CRISPR variation to genomic virulence signatures, I will be able to link a specific molecular mechanism to the co-evolutionary dynamics within a natural system. Such a mechanistic understanding of virulence evolution will fill an important knowledge gap in our understanding of host-parasite co-evolution in nature and in particular for emerging infectious diseases, where ongoing evolution may complicate prevention or control measures.

This dramatic neuronal increase is accommodated in a small volume due to the evolution of gyrencephaly (cortical folding). Gyrencephaly is presumably driven by the selective enlargement of a secondary, basally located progenitor region, the outer subventricular zone (OSVZ). In this project I will test if TRNP1 and ß-catenin, regulating progenitor abundance in mouse neocortex, affect progenitor growth in human OSVZ and respectively, cortical folding. I will also investigate how genes identified in gyrencephalic disorders contribute to cortical malformation. For this purpose, I will use novel human in vitro cerebral models, which can be derived from reprogrammed somatic cells. The expression of the target proteins will be modulated by combining the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing tool with established gene manipulation techniques. Apart from standard immunochemical methods, the dynamics of neuronal migration and abundance of distinct progenitors will be investigated by up-to-date in vivo imaging. Finally, the functional implication of downstream candidates identified by RNA-seq will be tested by overexpression/knockdown in the human cerebral model. Taken together, the project links innovative tools with proven methods to understand the most complex feature of the human brain, cortical folding.

Organ shape is to a large extent determined by cell behaviour and cell behaviour is to a large extent regulated by cell-cell interaction and cell-matrix interaction, as well as by cell-cell signalling.A major interest of my laboratory over the last few years has been to determine how branching morphogenesis restructures epithelial or endothelial structures such as the insect tracheal or the vertebrate vasculature. We have used high resolution live imaging with different marker proteins to analyse cell behaviour in vivo during the branching process. We are now increasing our efforts to better understand the molecular control of the relevant cell behaviours. With the help of the recently introduced genome editing tool Crispr/Cas, the task to mutate candidate genes has become straightforward, and we have already generate several mutants and characterized their role in angiogenesis. Since many genes/proteins are actively rather broadly and are required for basic cell functions such as cellular trafficking, cell division, etc., we have started to develop protein-manipulation tools which eventually should allow us to manipulate proteins in a cell- and time-induced manner. These tools are based on protein binders and we have pioneered the use of the later in multicellular systems some time ago. We are developing such protein-binder tools for proteins of interest in order to use them for protein trapping, degradation, miss-localization, ect. These studies should allow a novel view on the role of many proteins in angiogenesis, and pave the way to a molecular understanding of the fascinating process of branching morphogenesis.In the next granting period, we would like to address the following questions:1)How are cell rearrangement controlled and coordinated during the different steps of angiogenesis?2)How is the lumen formed during sprouting and anastomosis3)How are cell rearrangements and lumen formation controlled at the molecular level?In order to answer these questions, we will take the following experimental strategies:1)We will analyse the role of several proteins involved in the regulation of Ve-cadherin in cell rearrangements.2)We will analyse the role of trafficking in cell rearrangement and lumen formation.3)We will develop novel protein binder tools to manipulate proteins possibly involved in the above processes in a cell- and time-specific manner.4)We will try to establish CLEM in order to look at high resolution into endothelial cell during the branching process.

Organ shape is to a large extent determined by cell behaviour, and cell behaviour is to a large extent regulated by cell-cell signalling and cell mechanics. A major interest of my laboratory over the last few years has been to determine how branching morphogenesis restructures epithelial tissues to generate such fascinating structures as the trachea or the vasculature. While we have initially put much effort in understanding this process in vivo in an invertebrate system (tracheal development in Drosophila melanogaster) using state of the art genetics in combination with high resolution live imaging, we have recently moved much of our research efforts to vertebrates, in particular to zebrafish (Danio rerio). Using high resolution in vivo imaging, we have described the cellular activities during angiogenesis, in particular during sprouting, vessel fusion and vessel pruning. To our surprise, we find that the plasticity of developing vessels is accompanied by unexpected cell behaviour; endothelial cells can fission and self-fuse during anastomosis and pruning, respectively. With the advent of the recently introduced genome manipulation tools (TALEN, CRISPR/Cas9), a genetic dissection of the different steps in angiogenesis is now possible at unprecedented level, and proteins can be tagged at endogenous loci and used as marker for high resolution live imaging. We have recently applied intracellular nanobodies for the first time in developing drosophila embryos to directly manipulate protein function, in particular for protein degradation. We used an anti-GFP nanobody fused to an F-box in degrade GFP-fusion proteins (we called the method “deGradFP” for degrading GFP). In the meantime, we have functionalized the anti-GFP nanobody manifold, so that it can be used for in vivo protein trapping, protein localisation and for post-translation modification of proteins of interest. During the next granting period, we will introduce the use of intracellular nanobodies (and other protein binders) for studying the zebrafish vascular system, in particular to answer the following questions:Q1: How is the dynamic cell behaviour during sprouting controlled?Q2: How do endothelial cells recognize each other in order to connect?Q3: Which molecular processes are involved in luminal membrane expansion?Q4: Which molecular processes are involved in membrane fusion and membrane fission?In order to answer these questions, we propose to undertake the following experimental strategies:1) Investigate the role of VE-cad in the dynamic rearrangements of endothelial cells.2) Generate and use cutting edge in vivo live imaging tools to characterize molecular aspects of cell behaviour during angiogenesis processes.3) Generate and analyse mutations in candidate genes affecting distinct cellular activities.4) Generate and use novel tools to manipulate protein function in vivo - a step closer to a synthetic biology approach to organ formation.

330	Michael Dill	Camargo Laboratory Children's Hospital Boston	Camargo Laboratory Children's Hospital Boston	2017-05-01	2018-10-31	The role of YAP in liver cancer	Hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocellular carcinoma are the most common neoplasms of the liver and a global health concern, with very limited systemic treatment options.The Hippo/YAP-signaling pathway is an important regulator of liver organ size, as well as liver cell fate, and has been implicated in development of liver cancer. While the core Hippo pathway has been studied extensively, little is known about the actual downstream target effectors of YAP, which promote transcriptional output, especially in the context of tumorigenesis.We hypothesize that YAP is transcriptionally regulating relevant oncogenic drivers downstream to induce and maintain cancer. We further assume that dysregulated YAP is one of the important drivers of tumor maintenance. The aim of this ongoing project is to screen for and evaluate biologically relevant target effectors downstream of YAP and to better understand the role of YAP in tumor maintenance in the context of liver cancer.In the last months, we established an in vivo screen using a mouse model with hepatocyte-specific overexpression of a constitutive active YAP protein by deleting selected YAP target genes with a library of genomically integrated sgRNAs using the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system. Biologically and therapeutically attractive hits of the screen will be genetically and pharmacologically validated.Furthermore, we want to study the effect of YAP knockout in the setting of established liver tumors. To this end we are introducing CRISPR-Cas9 mediated mutations in commonly alterated tumor suppressor genes, and once liver tumors have established, analyze them for YAP activation and the effect of cancer cell-specific YAP knockout on tumor growth and biology.This study will provide a first systematic description of YAP targets in the context of carcinogenesis, and these findings have the potential to identify important downstream effectors as cancer drug targets. Further, we are going to better understand the biology of YAP in already established tumors.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Advanced Postdoc.Mobility	None	None
331	Michel Milinkovitch	University of Geneva	Département de Génétique et Evolution Faculté des Sciences Université de Genève	2016-03-01	2019-02-28	EvoDevo and Physics of Skin Colours	A few years ago, I obtained a SINERGIA grant together with Prof. Matthias Zwicker (Computer Science, Bern) and Dirk van der Marel (Condense Matter Physics, Geneva) with the ambition to initiate integration of biological, physical, and computer science approaches for a better understanding of skin colours and patterns of skin appendages and colour in amniotes. The skin appendages and pigmentation systems in vertebrates are promising model systems because species exhibit astonishing variations in skin appendage morphologies, as well as colour and colour patterns generated by pigments (black/brown, yellow and red) and structural elements (photonic crystals) incorporated into various types of chromatophores and iridophores, respectively. This variation is of great ecological importance as scales, feathers, hairs, and spines provide mechanical protection, and colours play critical roles in thermoregulation, photoprotection, camouflage, display, and reproductive isolation (hence, speciation). Our SINERGIA project was a success as we (a) Developed innovative robotics and computer graphics methods for automated phenotyping of skin surface (Martins, et al. 2015), (b) Used these developments for the analysis of scale patterns in crocodiles, a study that allowed us to uncover an entirely new developmental mechanism (Milinkovitch, et al. 2013), (c) Characterised unique multi-sensory micro-organs in the skin of crocodiles (Di-Poi and Milinkovitch 2013), (d) Characterised the development of skin appendages in the spiny mouse (Montandon, et al. 2014), (e) Characterised through histology, mass-spectrometry, photonic methods, and in-silico simulations the interactions between photonic nanostructures and pigmentary elements that generate extensive colour pattern variation in Phelsuma lizards (Saenko, et al. 2013), (f) Used mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data and Support-Vector-Machine (SVM) approaches to characterise the phylogeography of colour pattern variation in panther chameleons (Grbic, et al. 2015), (g) Combined biology and photonics to show that chameleons shift colour through active tuning of a lattice of guanine nanocrystals within a superficial thick layer of dermal iridophores (Teyssier, et al. 2015), (h) Characterised the physical parameters of surface-grating nano-structures (using electron and atomic-force microscopy) that are responsible for iridescence in snakes, and (i) used the knowledge acquired in point h to develop a new technique for computationally-effective and interactive simulation and rendering of diffraction effects produced by such biological nano-structures (Dhillon, et al. 2014). In addition, for linkage-mapping analyses, we have been continuously establishing, these last six years, families of corn snakes and lizards segregating mono-locus skin colour and colour pattern phenotypes.In the present multidisciplinary project, I propose to capitalise on our collaborations and combined expertise in computer science, physics and evolutionary developmental biology for the identification of the physical and biochemical self-organisation mechanisms underlying the formation of skin pigmentation and skin structural colours in squamate reptiles. This will require the development of biological and physical assays as well as new computer science methods, but the project will be greatly facilitated by the equipment, methodologies, and biological material, as well as the close multidisciplinary collaborations, that we have developed in the past. First, we will finalise the linkage mapping analysis of colour pattern mutations in snakes to identify the genes involved in these spectacular phenotypes. Second, we will produce ex-vivo culture of embryonic skin and tissue-disrupted in-vitro cell cultures from reptilian skin and we will treat these samples with pharmacological agents and CRISPR/Cas9 transgenesis to characterise the role of the identified (by linkage mapping) pathways in normal and mutant patterning. In parallel, we will improve and extend our 3D geometry and colour texture acquisition pipeline, perform quantitative analyses of phenotypes, characterise their variation, track changes during their development, and develop mathematical models to simulate pattern formation using Partial-Differential-Equations, Finite-Element and multi-resolution and Cell Automata Methods, all guided by our results on ex-vivo and in-vitro cultures. Third, we will perform hyperspectral imaging and advanced photonic crystallography (using scatterometry and near-field techniques) in chameleons, other lizards and snakes. These analyses will uncover the detailed physical and biological mechanisms explaining how squamate reptiles generate and manipulate structural colours, for example for changing colour during display as shown in our recent article on chameleons (Teyssier et al. 2015). The project is at the frontier between the physics of biology and evolutionary developmental biology. My multidisciplinary team of researchers (including physicists, computer scientists, developmental biologists, and evolutionary biologists), as well as the access to the laboratory equipment and competences in photonics of Prof. Dirk van der Marel’s team, will greatly facilitate our analyses of the evolution and ecological significance of signalling pathways and self-organisational phenomena involved in the determinism of adaptive skin colours and colour patterns.

Paediatric tumours have particularly benefited from advances in research in the last 30 years. However the treatment-associated long-term side effects induced by their lack of specificity to tumour cells and high dosage administration remain a challenging problem. As children are by definition long-term survivors, there is a strong need for the development of new, low-toxicity, better targeted and efficient therapeutic strategies for all types of childhood cancers. TAT-RasGAP317-326 is a cell-permeable peptide derived from the p120 RasGAP protein. This peptide does not modulate cell death by itself but, potently sensitizes adult tumour cells in vitro and in vivo to various anti-cancer treatments, including genotoxins and radiotherapy. Importantly, it displays specificity to cancer cells as it does not sensitize non-tumoral cells to genotoxin-induced apoptosis. TAT-RasGAP317-326 may therefore be of considerable benefit to children by increasing the efficacy of anti-cancer therapies, which could allow to lower their dosage and associated side-effects. Very encouraging in vitro preliminary results, obtained by screening various childhood cancer cell lines, indicate that pediatric tumours are sensitive to the sensitizing action of TAT-RasGAP317-326. As a consequence, we propose to undertake this project in collaboration with two laboratories. The first one is the Research in Pediatric Oncology Laboratory of CHUV directed by Dr Nicole Gross, who has extensive expertise in the biological and genetic mechanisms involved in the development of neuroblastoma, Ewing’s sarcoma and medulloblastoma. They have also developed in vivo orthotopic models for these types of tumours. The second one is the laboratory of Prof. Christian Widmann, who is highly experienced in the field of apoptosis and has developed the TAT-RasGAP317-326 peptide. This complementary expertise is a great advantage for both in vitro and in vivo experimentations. The aims of the present project are:•In vitro assessment of the response of childhood cancer cells to sensitization by TAT-RasGAP317-326; •Evaluation of the clinical potential of TAT-RasGAP317-326 by exploring its in vivo efficacy using well-characterized orthotopic and heterotopic nude mouse models;•Elucidation of the mode of action of TAT-RasGAP317-326 and more specifically its targets using both an unbiased immune-based pull-down approach and CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-Cas9) knockout technology.

While glucose is metabolised into lactate and thus diverted from the TCA cycle, glutamine is used to fuel the TCA cycle and to meet the high demand of nitrogen and carbon in rapidly dividing cells. As tumours grow, the continuous secretion of lactate lowers the pH in the tumour environment and the high consumption of glucose and glutamine may locally lead to nutrient deprivation. Therefore, I hypothesize that cancer cells that drive malignancy must possess an adaptable metabolic state allowing them to survive stress conditions. My studies aim to identify and characterize the reprogramming events that enable adaptation to environmental stress, such as glutamine deprivation or acidosis. There are two parts to my proposal. First, I will generate antibodies targeting human cell surface states specific to defined environmental conditions using a phage-displayed synthetic antibody library. The recognised cell surface proteins will be identified by mass spectrometry and the affinity reagents will be validated across a panel of cancer cell lines. Second, I will use the CRISPR-Cas9 system to perform genome-wide gene knockout screens for genes essential for adaptation to altered environmental conditions, as well as for genes that are required for the expression of stress-specific cell surface markers. Identified gene candidates will be further characterized using biochemical approaches and the therapeutical use of the identified sensitizers and regulators of stress will be explored.Together, these approaches will foster the development of new affinity reagents that can be used to mark cell surface features that are linked to environmental stress conditions, identify proteins that are functionally associated with specific stress conditions, and provide a detailed understanding of the genetic factors required for expression of stress-specific cell surface proteins. Furthermore, the proposed research will identify novel sensitizers and regulators of environmental stress and is expected to reveal novel drug targets and tools for cancer therapeutics.

Louis Pasteur Hôpitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg	2017-03-01	2018-08-31	Mechanisms of Staphylococcus aureus leukotoxins inducing ETosis	ETosis is a form of cell death where extracellular traps (ETs) are released by neutrophils and macrophages, contributing to the innate immune response. ETs are formed in response to bi-component leukotoxins (LukS-PV/LukF-PV for PVL and HlgC/HlgB for Hlg) of the Gram + bacterium Staphylococcus (S.) aureus, in order to trap and kill the invading pathogen. ETosis may thus, be beneficial for pathogenic infections, but may also present negative effects such as tissue damage due to inflammation or bacterial clearing of the ETs. Thus, as their precise role remains scarce, it is essential to understand the signaling mechanisms of ETosis and identify potentially different signaling pathways in response to the different leukotoxins. My objectives will be to identify differences in the intracellular signaling pathways during ETosis triggered by S. aureus leukotoxins (LukS-PV/LukF-PV and HlgC/HlgB), as well as by their cross combinations (HlgC/LukF-PV and LukS-PV/HlgB) to determine their specific roles. Transcriptomics will be applied for the analysis of these differences, followed by the Clustered Regularly-Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system for gene knockout in order to confirm the implication of specific genes in ETosis. This would shed light on whether only one or both proteins of these leukotoxins are responsible for the activation of different signaling pathways in ETosis. Finally, inhibitor identifications of this induced ETosis by targeting identified signals is essential for the prevention of severe tissue damage in response to S. aureus infections, as this bacterium is known for its DNase production, favoring replication through the released DNA from ETs. This study favors the discovery of specific signaling pathways during ETosis in response to bacterial toxins and the detection of well adapted inhibitors for ETosis. The study of host and pathogen factors involved in cell death resulting in extensive tissue damage may thus be facilitated, as well as the establishment of a therapy resulting in the bacterial clearance in some severe human infections.

The cancer stem cell hypothesis proposes that a rare subpopulation of cells within a tumor possesses the key features of stem cells, namely self-renewal and multi-potency, and that these stem-like cancer cells arise from oncogenic transformation of normal stem cells or closely related multi-potent progenitors. Patient-derived xenografts of prostate cancer represent excellent models to explore the biological and molecular implications of the cancer stem cell hypothesis in the progression to castration resistant prostate cancer, and to identify key features of putative stem/progenitor-like PCa cells that are likely to be at its origin. Based on our previous work and on ongoing studies on normal prostate epithelial stem/progenitor cells, we plan to investigate the two following aims:1. To identify/characterize pre-existing stem/progenitor-like PCa cells based on differential resistance to castration for survival and/or growth2. To investigate the molecular phenotype and/or genetic switch that confers androgen independent growth in a pre-existing stem/progenitor-like PCa cellsThe phenotype, genomic aberrations and the functional role of stem/progenitor-like prostate cancer cells as tumor-initiating/re-initiating cells in castration resistant prostate cancer will be studied in two pairs of patient-derived xenografts. Each pair of patient-derived xenografts represents models either of androgen independent prostate cancer for survival, but not growth (BM18 and PC-82 models) or of prostate cancer independent for both, survival and growth (LAPC-4/-9). According to the selection model, castration/regeneration strategy will facilitate the identification/selection of pre-existing in vivo tumor re-initiating, stem/progenitor-like prostate cancer cells under androgen deprivation. A parallel castration/regeneration strategy for in vitro organoid-initiating cell(s) from cell subpopulation(s) surviving castration in the four patient derived xenograft models will further certify their stem/progenitor-like properties (self-renewal, expansion and differentiation) and characterize their phenotype. An unique set of markers (ALDH, CD44, CRIPTO and MCAM) will be employed for their identification/selection. A comparative, genomic and transcriptomic analysis of tumor re-initiating and organoid-initiating stem/progenitor-like prostate cancer cell populations from the two sets of patient derived xenografts will be then performed. Putative, castration resistant prostate cancer-“driving” mutations found in LAPC-4/-9 will be assessed for functionality by genome editing (CRISPR-Cas9) in BM18 and PC-82.Our goal is to expand our understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling intrinsic resistance to androgen deprivation therapy. Such information will be important for understanding why prostate cancer relapse as castration resistant prostate cancer is invariably fatal and for developing better treatments for castration resistant prostate cancer. Additionally, these studies could lead to the identification of novel mechanisms of castration resistance that could be translated into biomarkers able to distinguish indolent from aggressive prostate cancer and provide surrogate end-point markers for monitoring prostate cancer treatments. The uniqueness of this proposal lies in: a) the assessment of the value of a novel stem/progenitor-like prostate cancer cell signature; b) the comparative phenotypic and genomic analysis of preclinical models, in vitro and in vivo, that differ in their capacity for growth progression under androgen deprivation; c) the reverse genetic approach on stem/progenitor-like prostate cancer cell; d) the evaluation of the prognostic value of the stem/progenitor-like prostate cancer cell signature(s) on tissue micro arrays.The proposed study may provide an invaluable translational tool for stratifying early-stage prostate cancer patients at risk of castration resistant prostate cancer progression. It may also propose novel therapeutic targets for a curative intent.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div. I-III)	429000.0	CHF

Despite the benefit of chemotherapy, patients with disseminated solid cancers are usually not cured and eventually develop resistance to all drugs available. The precise mechanisms underlying resistance are often unclear, however. A good example are platinum-based drugs, such as cisplatin and carboplatin. They are particularly effective to treat patients with BRCA1/2-mutated breast or ovarian carcinomas. Due to the BRCA1/2 deficiency the tumor cells are unable to repair chemotherapy-induced DNA damage by homology-directed DNA repair and many tumor cells undergo cell death. However, most of the patients with tumor metastasis develop secondary resistance eventually. Moreover, many patients hardly respond upfront and only suffer from the severe side effects of the chemotherapy. Since the underlying mechanisms of drug resistance are not fully understood, the therapy response of the BRCA1/2-deficient cancers is difficult to predict. Several cases of resistance may be explained by secondary mutations that restore BRCA1/2 function, but these do not explain all cases of resistance.The goal of this project is to identify novel mechanisms that explain the poor drug response of BRCA1/2-deficient tumors. For this purpose genome-wide loss-of-function screens will be applied as an unbiased and versatile tool to search for new resistance mechanisms. The use of the new generation CRISPR-Cas9 screening technology allows permanent gene knockouts in diploid cells. By testing about 130,000 single guide RNAs that result in the mutagenesis of about 20,600 genes, the functional relevance of these genes on drug resistance can be tested. In this project, the genome-wide screen will be conducted on mouse cells derived from BRCA1/2-deficient mammary tumors using platinum drug selection. The advantage of these cells is that mechanisms of resistance can also be validated in vivo. This project will hopefully unravel new mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance, providing new targets for anti-cancer therapy. The broader understanding of therapy resistance will allow more tailored therapy possibilities increasing the patient’s benefit in terms of a better prognosis and less therapy side effects.

In particular the goal of the Follow-up proposal for my AdvancedPostdoctoral Mobility (APM) fellowship is to finish and improve the work on the proposed aims,complete an exciting new collaboration that may lead to the identification of a novel diseasemechanism using the in vitro modeling technology and start the application process for runningmy own laboratory.The neurodegenerative/neurodevelopmental disease Familial Dysautonomia (FD) is being used to establish the principle of disease modeling in a dish as valid alternative/addition to animal models. The use of patient specific stem cells enables the study of human disease pathogenesis, primary chemical compound screens and the validation of existing drugs.In a set of elegant studies, the Studer lab has previously established FD-patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiated them into neural crest (NC) cells, precursors ofthe peripheral nervous system, specifically affected in FD. Characteristics of the disease detected in patients were reproduced in vitro establishing the first disease specific, iPSC-based in vitromodel of a genetic disease[1]. Furthermore, the partial rescue of disease phenotypes was achieved using kinetin, a plant hormone. Remarkably, kinetin has now moved forward into actual clinical trials for treating children with FD. Finally, the FD-iPSC model also enabled the first primary high-throughput drug screen in human patient-specific cells, a screen which yielded new drugcandidates with distinct therapeutic action and potentially higher potency than kinetin (Lee andZeltner et al, Nature Biotechnology 2012)[2].For my APM fellowship I proposed 4 aims and have completed 3 of them. Namely: Idemonstrated that the stem cell-based disease modeling system in FD is capable of modeling the differences in symptom presentation (severe, mild or absent) among FD patients. Fibroblasts ofthese FD patient groups were reprogrammed to iPSCs (Aim 1), differentiated in vitro and used to investigate three next steps to establish the hESC/iPSC-based disease modeling technologyfurther: 1. The sensitivity of the system to detect differences in patient's phenotypes in vitro.After establishing a more defined and faster differentiation protocol for the derivation of NC cells(Zeltner et al., JoVE in press), I show that the FD in vitro model can recapitulate varying disease severity reported in the different patient groups (Aim 2). 2. The potential of the technology forthe study of disease mechanisms and drug discovery. I show that patients with mild FDpresentation are able to generate the critical cell types, i.e. NC, peripheral sensory neurons(pSNs) and autonomic neurons (ANs) similar to those in healthy controls. However, I also foundthat the reason those patients suffer from FD is due to a neurodegenerative phenotype in thosecells based on cell survival studies in pSNs (Aim 3). For the extension of my APM fellowship, Ipropose to optimize the established differentiation protocol for generating ANs (Follow-up Aim 1) and to assess survival similarly for FD-derived ANs (Follow-up Aim 2). 3. The specificity ofhES/iPSC-based disease modeling in FD (Aim 4). Originally, I proposed to use the AAV-mediated gene targeting technology to genetically modify FD-iPSCs. After failed attempts to modify the cells, I generated one potentially targeted clone. However, this clone showed abnormal growthbehavior likely unrelated to any gene correction event. Accordingly, I refrained from using it anyfurther. Thus, for the APM follow-up, I propose to generate gene-edited, isogenic FD-iPSCs pairsvia an alternative and highly efficient technology based on the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. I have already built the necessary tools for use in FD-iPSCs. The resulting isogenic gene-corrected clones should provide the final proof that the FD in vitro model is faithfully and specificallyrepresenting FD (Follow-up Aim 3). Furthermore, establishing this state-of-the-art gene targeting technique will also be a valuable tool for my future independent career. In Follow-up Aim 4, Ipropose to finish a recently established, multi-institutional collaboration on the molecularmechanisms of why severe and mild FD patients present with distinct disease severity despite their identical genotype. This work goes beyond the goals initially proposed in my APM fellowshipand has the potential to offer unprecedented insights into the molecular mechanisms of FD, andtherefore should result in an additional key independent publication.*references can be found in the main proposal	Swiss National Science Foundation	Advanced Postdoc.Mobility	None	None

Recently, the CRISPR/Cas9 bacterial immune defense system has been employed for genome editing, and has since largely revolutionized the field. The tremendous success of this system lies not only in its high efficiency, but also in in the simplicity of design. It uses short guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to specifically target the Cas9 nuclease to the desired DNA locus, where it generates double-strand breaks (DSBs). DBSs trigger repair by either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which is an error-prone process, or homology-directed repair (HDR), which enables the introduction of any desired base-pair changes.Numerous studies have already successfully used CRISPR/Cas9-meadiated gene editing to repair disease-causing genes in cell lines and model organisms, thereby raising hope for bringing therapeutic genome editing into the clinics. Unfortunately, however, these studies also revealed the limitation of this technology for in vivo gene editing approaches: in the majority of cases, CRISPR/Cas9-induced DSBs generate indels by NHEJ rather than precisely edited alleles by HDR. Because NHEJ is in particular prominent in quiescent cells, which do not express all the enzymes needed for HDR, novel systems that reduce NHEJ and induce HDR need to be developed to also apply CRISPR/Cas9 to in vivo gene editing in organs with slow cellular turnover rates.In the proposed project, we aim to develop a novel approach that enhances HDR repair of CRISPR/Cas9 induced DSBs in order to correct disease-causing mutations in the adult mouse liver, a tissue that is mainly quiescent. Considering that HDR is only active during the S/G2 phase of the cell cycle, we have recently engineered a Cas9:Geminin system which limits the generation of DSBs to phases when HDR takes place. We have already tested this approach in immortalized cell lines carrying a fluorescent reporter for NHEJ and HDR, and found that the ratio between HDR and NHEJ is indeed shifted towards HDR. In a next step, we would like to test this improved CRISPR/Cas9 system in vivo in the liver of mice that carry a similar fluorescent reporter for HDR and NHEJ. In addition to the blocking of DSB formation in quiescent hepatocytes, we will try to additionally boost HDR rates by treating mice with partial hepatectomy (PHx) after CRISPR/Cas9 component delivery, which ectopically induces hepatocyte proliferation. Finally, as a proof-of-concept study for therapeutic CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing, we will perforem long-term efficacy studies with these newly developed approaches to correct mouse models of the monogenic liver diseases phenylketonuria and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency.

Two important components of the HR pathway, BRCA1 and BRCA2, are frequently impaired in breast cancers. To specifically target the HR pathway, a novel therapeutic approach has been investigated: inhibition of the PARP 1/ 2 DNA repair enzymes induces lethality in BRCA1- and BRCA2-deficient cells but widely spares wild type cells. Despite the benefit of this and other DNA damage-inducing treatments, drug resistance remains a major obstacle in clinical oncology. In particular, mechanisms of therapy escape of HR-deficient tumors are poorly understood.In this project I aim to tackle the problem of drug resistance using a novel tool: at the Netherlands Cancer Institute I shall carry out loss-of-function genomic screens using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. For this purpose, I will use cell lines with large intragenic deletions of BRCA1/2 that cannot be restored. My hypothesis is that restoration of BRCA1/2-independent DNA repair is underlying drug resistance. I will therefore focus on a CRISPR/Cas9 library that targets about 500 genes that encode proteins involved in the DNA damage response.The Netherlands Cancer Institute is one of the world-leading institutes for cancer research. The group of Prof. Jos Jonkers has special expertise in large genome screening approaches using HR-deficient cells. I expect that the experience gained in Amsterdam will substantially broaden my knowledge. Moreover, I want to help establishing this revolutionizing technique when I am back in Bern. I hope that with this screening approach, I will identify new hits that explain why HR-deficient tumors acquire drug resistance.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Doc.Mobility	None	None

These RNAs include the 5S RNA component of ribosomes and all tRNAs, which are essential for translation, as well as several other RNA molecules involved in a wide variety of processes including processing of other RNA molecules and the control of pol II transcription elongation. Pol III recognizes three main classes of promoters, referred to as the class 1, 2, and 3 promoters. Whereas class 1 and 2 promoters are gene-internal, class 3 promoters are located in the 5’ flanking sequences of the genes; they are highly similar to the promoters of small nuclear RNA genes transcribed by pol II, and they recruit several of the same transcription factors. The class 3 pol III promoters and the pol II snRNA promoters, which differ only by the presence or absence of a TATA box, thus constitute a nice system to dissect mechanisms leading to selective polymerase recruitment. In the first aim of this project, we propose to continue our studies to decipher the protein-protein interactions that lead to recruitment of the pol III-specific transcription factor BRF2 on class 3 pol III promoters, and the pol II-specific transcription factor TFIIB on pol II snRNA promoters.Pol III transcription is tightly regulated with cell growth and proliferation, and several factors involved in such regulation have been identified. One of these is a repressor called MAF1. MAF1 is inactivated by TORC1-dependent phosphorylation. Upon cellular stress leading to inactivation of the TORC1 pathway, it becomes dephosphorylated and can then inhibit pol III transcription by associating with the enzyme and/or some of its transcription factors. However, our recent results indicate that not all pol III genes are similarly down-regulated by MAF1. In the second aim of this proposal, we will determine whether pol III genes are brought together through three-dimensional chromosomal domains, and whether such domains contain similarly regulated genes. Down-regulation of the Maf1 gene in several systems leads to perturbations of lipid metabolism through mechanisms that are so far not understood. Our recent results have shown that MAF1 is a chronic down-regulator of pol III transcription rather than an acute repressor active only in response to stress, and that in a Maf1-/- mouse synthesis of tRNA molecules is greatly increased. Paradoxically, this leads to generally decreased rather than increased translation. We propose to examine whether much increased synthesis of tRNA molecules might lead to defects in tRNA modifications, themselves leading to defects in translation, and to characterize by ribosome profiling whether the translation defect is general or whether translation of some mRNAs is particularly affected. Several years ago, we noticed a mammalian interspersed repeat (MIR) present in an antisense orientation within the first intron of the Polr3e gene, which codes for one of the pol III subunits. This MIR was highly occupied by pol III and we noticed an accumulation of pol II at the end of the antisense MIR, suggesting that it might constitute a roadblock for pol II elongation through the Polr3e intron. We have used the CRISPR/Cas9 technology to engineer cell lines with a deleted MIR, and we observe increased expression of the POLR3E subunit. We will determine whether this leads to increased pol III activity in the cell, and we will compare the effect to that of deleting the Maf1 repressor gene. We will determine whether deletion of the MIR, or both the MIR and Maf1, has different effects on translation.This research will reveal mechanisms involved in the assembly of pol II and pol III transcription complexes and in the regulation of pol III transcription. It will further uncover an exciting new link between efficiency of pol III transcription, mature tRNA production, and translation, which opens up a new layer of gene expression regulation.

Although the number of HIV-related deaths has decreased continuously since its peak in 2005, curative treatments for retroviral infections are nonexistent, and it is estimated that up to 1.7 million people died from AIDS-related causes worldwide in 2013. Understanding the underlying biology of retroviral infections is fundamental toward developing successful antiviral strategies, such as preventive and therapeutic measures. The persistence of retroviral reservoirs in the cellular genome is challenging and has not been directly targeted by commonly used antiretroviral therapies against HIV. Animal models are needed to investigate host-virus interactions and to evaluate new therapies. As in humans, retroviral infections are prevalent in diverse animal species, including the domestic cat. The prevalence of feline leukemia virus (FeLV; a gammaretrovirus) infection in the cat varies greatly, depending on host age, health, environment and lifestyle. FeLV in cats is a well-established animal model for tumor and retroviral research that has been used for nearly 50 years1. After FeLV exposure, most cats develop a regressive FeLV infection, characterized by an early and efficient immune response mediated by neutralizing antibodies and FeLV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. This remarkable feature of FeLV infection in cats yields a great opportunity to study effective antiretroviral immune responses. However, approximately one-third of cats exposed to FeLV develop progressive FeLV infections with persistent viremia; these animals lack effective FeLV-specific humoral and cellular immunity. These persistently infected cats develop fatal FeLV-associated diseases, including lymphoma, leukemia, immune suppression and anemia, and they die within a few years of infection. It is very rare but possible for cats to raise a protective immune response and overcome persistent viremia on their own, even months after infection: we have observed full recovery from viremia in one cat more than one year after the onset of infection2. This proves that under the right circumstances recovery from an established progressive retroviral infection is possible. To date, no treatment regimen is known to cure persistent viremia in cats. In the present proposal, we aim to develop a method to aid cats in overcoming progressive infection-associated viremia by lowering proviral and viral loads. We will accomplish this by specifically destroying FeLV provirus in host cells using recently developed gene-editing technology in combination with oligonucleotide (ODN)-mediated immune system stimulation. We hypothesize that these measures will tip the virus-host balance in favor of cats, which in turn will be able to mount effective immune responses to overcome persistent viremia and subsequent infection-related fatality. We have shown that the use of CpG ODNs in cats is safe and results in decreased retroviral DNA and RNA loads in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)3. For gene editing, we will employ the RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease from the type II prokaryotic clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) adaptive immune system4. The efficiency, accuracy and simplicity of CRISPR/Cas9 makes it an extremely powerful tool that, when applied to the FeLV model, should yield an exceptional opportunity to investigate new anti-retroviral strategies in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Using CRISPR/Cas9 to delete or deactivate proviruses in the cellular genome offers the possibility of eliminating retroviral reservoirs from the genome, facilitating the treatment of retroviral diseases. The current application will address the above aim via two subprojects. In Subproject A, we will optimize a CRISPR/Cas9 system to introduce double-strand breaks into the FeLV provirus in vitro using FeLV-infected cell lines and PBMCs from experimentally FeLV-infected cats. We will assess the efficiencies of different CRISPR/Cas9 systems (targeting different sequences within FeLV) in introducing double-strand breaks that lead to nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ; SURVEYOR assay) and in reducing viral replication. In a preliminary experiment, we identified a target sequence within the capsid gene of FeLV that was most promising in reducing viral load. Additionally, in Subproject A, we will assess the safety of these systems in vitro. In Subproject B, we aim to construct a suitable gene therapy vector containing the CRISPR/Cas9 system for subsequent in vivo delivery (future project). The vector will be based on adeno-associated virus (AAV)5, and its safety and efficiency will be evaluated and tested in various cell lines and in PBMCs from experimentally FeLV-infected cats. Because the presence of pre-existing antibodies to AAV in a host6 may impact the effectiveness of gene therapy, we will also assess the presence of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies in pet cats in this subproject.A curative treatment for progressively infected cats is urgently needed in veterinary practice. To date, no effective treatment option has been offered to owners of FeLV-infected cats with progressive disease, leading to harm and suffering in both cats and their owners. Cats with progressive infections must be separated from other cats to prevent viral spread, and infected cats die from FeLV-associated diseases within a short period. As a non-ideal alternative, such cats can be euthanized upon discovery of infection, also causing distress and sorrow to pet owners.In addition to benefitting veterinary medicine, the results of the suggested project will also be of great interest to retrovirological researchers in general. In the current proposal, we suggest investigating the use of a gene-editing technology to destroy retroviral proviral DNA in an outbred animal. In contrast to mice and rats, cats have an average lifespan that enables the assessment of long-term efficacy. Furthermore, due to the different outcomes produced by FeLV infection and the possibility of mounting an effective immune response against the virus, the short-term efficacy of our approach will be immediately evident. While we recognize the differences between FeLV gammaretrovirus infection in cats and HIV lentivirus infection in humans, this natural animal model may yield proof-of-concept results regarding the efficiency of using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to target retroviral proviral sequences and reduce proviral loads in an outbred species. In contrast to HIV, the genomic sequence of FeLV is quite conserved throughout infection. Because the efficacy of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is largely dependent on matching gRNA to target DNA, applying it to treat FeLV is a promising strategy, and our goal should be attainable.Additionally, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has great therapeutic potential for treating latently infected cats, which parallel HIV-infected humans in several aspects. In cats with latent infections, the provirus reservoir maintains its full replicative potential even while suppressed by the immune system. Thus, if the immune system fails, reactivation of FeLV infection may occur7, similarly to what would be expected if antiretroviral therapy is halted in HIV-infected humans. Thus, the destruction of latent virus reservoirs in such cats is an ultimate focus of this proposal. This goal could be further addressed in future studies in cats with regressive FeLV infections. Finally, by surveying pet cats for pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to AAV, we lay a foundation for gene therapy in domestic cats.1 Willett & Hosie, Vet J 2013 195:16-23.2 Hofmann-Lehmann et al, Vet Immunol Immunopathol 1995 46:127-73 Robert-Tissot et, Vet Immunol Immunopathol 2012 150:1-94 Horvath and Barrangou: Science 2010 327:167-705 Kotterman & Schaffer.

It is activated by energy stress and phosphorylates several cellular targets involved in metabolism to shift the balance toward more energy production and decreases anabolic pathways. Several of these AMPK downstream effectors have been identified by the host laboratory in the last decade. In addition, AMPK also affects gene expression by direct phosphorylation of transcription factor and modulators. This has been well studied in yeast and plants, while transcriptional effectors of AMPK in mammals are less studied.In the present proposal, I intend to characterize new downstream effectors of AMPK in two important compartments for metabolism regulation: the mitochondria and the nucleus. To this end, I plan to use stable isotope labeling in mammals (SILAM) combined with phospho protein enrichment using 14-3-3 affinity purification to identify proteins that change in sub-cellular localization, abundance or phosphorylation status upon energy stress in wild-type livers but not AMPK KO livers in response to the AMPK-activating drug metformin. The candidates identified will be further analyzed by in vitro phosphorylation assays. Candidates that show direct phosphorylation by AMPK will be mutated in their phosphorylation site using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in mammalian cells to study their relevance to the adaptation to cellular stress in response to AMPK activation. Altogether, these experiments will allow me to identify new targets of AMPK involved in transcription regulation as well as mitochondrial function and will broaden our understanding of the way AMPK mediates adaptation to metabolic stress.

The cells are circulating at high numbers in the bloodstream, where they constantly control our body for infections. If neutrophils are activated by encountering a site of infection, they are able to respond to infecting microorganisms by a variety of defense mechanisms. One of these mechanisms is the release of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs), a structure of chromatin and attached proteins, which is expelled from activated neutrophils. The generation of NETs was discovered as a unique cell death pathway called NETosis and the released NETs are considered to trap and kill invading microorganisms. The mechanism underlying the process of NET formation is only poorly understood. This is in part due to the fact that neutrophils are terminally differentiated cells with a short lifespan. Therefore, genetic manipulations of isolated neutrophils are technically not feasible. This project aims to investigate the mechanism of NETosis by a genome-wide gene disruption screen. I previously established a cell culture system using a myeloid cell line, which can be differentiated into neutrophilic cells. These differentiated cells are able to form NETs and will be used to knock down or knock out genes by either RNAi or the newly developed CRISPR/Cas9 system, respectively. Genes, which are identified by this screen to influence NETosis, will be verified using different cell culture systems, such as hematopoietic stem cells with subsequent in vitro differentiation into neutrophils or human primary neutrophils. Target genes identified by the screen will also be verified in vivo in mice. This project will establish a method to analyze neutrophil-specific functions by genetic manipulations. Furthermore, the screen will help to understand the poorly characterized mechanism of NET formation as well as the in vivo impact of NETs during infection, which is of relevance for both basic and translational research.

Disease course is usually aggressive and still only a minority of patients can be cured despite improvements in long-term survival rates over the past decades. With the advent of massively parallel (next-generation) sequencing the mutational landscape of adult de novo AML has been elucidated and this has led to a paradigm shift in the understanding of leukemia development. In contrast to the previous model of leukemogenesis that was based on the concept that mutations in signaling pathways (class 1 mutations) leading to uncontrolled proliferation must co-occur with mutations in transcription factors (class 2 mutations) leading to blocked normal myeloid differentiation, current data suggest a more complex molecular pathogenesis. Although the number of recurrently mutated genes in AML is relatively small and adult de novo AML genomes contain only 3-4 driver mutations on average, recurrent mutations affect genes with multiple cellular functions including transcription factors, epigenetic modification and RNA splicing. Mutations in TP53 which encodes the fundamental tumor suppressor p53 can be found in approximately 5% of de novo and up to 30% of therapy-related AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients and are associated with a particularly dismal prognosis with very poor long-term survival even in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.Thus, better pre-clinical in vitro and animal models are urgently needed to both study the molecular mechanisms of TP53-mutant leukemia as well as to identify synthetic lethal interactions that may represent potential therapeutic targets.To achieve this goal, I will combine several experimental strategies. In a first step, I will generate an isogenic cell culture-based model of TP53-mutant AML. In a second step, I will use various complementary experimental approaches including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, IP-MS and a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 in vitro loss-of-function genetic screen to identify potentially 'druggable' synthetic lethal interactions using the TP53-mutant isogenic AML cell lines. Last, I will use mouse models of TP53-mutant AML to validate putative therapeutic targets in vivo. The findings will not only be informative on basic principles of the pathogenesis of TP53-mutant AML, but importantly, may hold the promise to improve therapies for patients suffering from TP53-mutant leukemia.

The previous investigation, entitled “Comparative Transcriptomics of Leprosy”, generated the preliminary data and main hypotheses that we now wish to test in a more ambitious, integrated manner. Leprosy is an infectious granulomatous disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae, which can result in severe disabilities in humans if diagnosed too late, this neglected tropical disease remains a global health problem and is of special significance in Brazil. Diagnosis is confounded by the many forms in which the disease can manifest and by the lack of universally effective, evidence-based diagnostic tools. At over 31,000 new cases, the incidence of leprosy in Brazil is the second highest worldwide, after India, and the number of relapse cases after multidrug therapy (MDT) is the highest in the world. In addition, the World Health Organization is concerned about multidrug-resistant leprosy in Brazil as MDT is the sole means of controlling the disease.In the present project, we will use hypothesis-driven research to underpin new interventions in support of public health measures to combat leprosy in Brazil and elsewhere. Our proposal, 'From genome-derived knowledge to diagnostics for leprosy' is built around three specific aims that are interlinked and explore the same cohorts of patients and controls. In specific aim 1, for which substantial progress has already been made, we will compare the host transcriptome in whole blood using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) between leprosy patients and healthy controls in order to identify genes that are differentially expressed; the products of such genes could later serve as specific biomarkers for active and latent leprosy. We hypothesize that patients with active disease will display a different gene expression signature to that of healthy subjects as has been reported for tuberculosis. The protocols have been successfully established during the pilot study and the first datasets generated. However, these were too small to allow statistical significance to be reached so we will now investigate larger groups of patients and controls. Validation of the best candidate genes will involve a two-pronged approach. First, gene expression will be monitored by RNA-Seq before, during and after treatment in a small group of patients. Second, candidate gene expression will be quantified in different groups of patients and healthy individuals using RTqPCR. Expression levels of the newly validated candidate genes will also be measured in a population of household contacts and the robustness of the approach challenged by measuring expression of the candidate genes in a blind test. The expected outcome is knowledge about genes/proteins that differentiate between disease, exposure and cure. This knowledge could later be translated into a diagnostic application such as an ELISA test that measures the levels of a specific protein in human blood or a point-of-care diagnostic test.Specific aim 2 is linked to specific aim 1 and involves genotyping the patients and their contacts by means of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in order to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the host genome or signatures in expression of genes and pathways. SNPs will also be surveyed in two household contact populations, one who developed the disease and one who did not. From the literature and our own results, we expect to uncover SNPs in genes for innate immunity such as PARK2, encoding the ubiquitin ligase Parkin, or the NOD2 pathway (NOD2, RIPK2, TNFSF15, and LRRK2). In parallel, based on the results of the integrative approach, we will analyze the function of these genes using an ex vivo system. Genome editing will be undertaken using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to introduce these mutations into human THP-1 cells. The THP-1 parent and the resultant mutant cell lines will then be infected with live M. leprae and the host response compared either by RNA-Seq or by using highly sensitive ELISA to measure the levels of cytokines/chemokines associated with innate immunity, such as the type I interferons. In this manner we will confirm causality between the SNPs discovered and susceptibility/resistance to leprosy. Furthermore, this approach will allow us to rank the candidate genes in terms of their power and functional importance. Once again, this information could underpin a diagnostic test for leprosy or exposure to M. leprae.Finally, to complete this investigation in Specific aim 3, we will attempt to correlate the genome sequence of the M. leprae strain from each patient with his/her disease state, haplotype and immunogenetics. We have recently optimized a DNA extraction method, which includes a step for host DNA depletion, that allows us to obtain near complete genome sequences from human skin biopsies in a cost-effective manner. From the genome sequences, we will then deduce the strain genotype, establish phylogenies and predict the drug susceptibility or resistance profiles. All the genome-derived information will be centralized in a web-based relational database that also contains details of the patient's case history and demographics.Based on the successful outcome of our earlier collaboration, we are fully confident that we can complete all three specific aims in the allotted timeframe as the foundations for the investigation have been laid and the cohorts of patients and controls established or identified. We anticipate that our integrated approach will lead to deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of leprosy and to bilateral transfer of technology. Furthermore, the subsequent translation of the results of our investigation into diagnostic tools can be envisioned and this may provide a response to an unmet medical need both in Brazil and in other countries where leprosy remains endemic.

The latter has a major impact on human health as it leads to about 250 million clinical cases of malaria and nearly one million deaths each year in endemic countries. To date, no malaria vaccine is available and increasing drug resistance is observed globally. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of these parasites, which would lead to the generation of new drugs or a vaccine, is urgently needed. Most Apicomplexa are obligate intracellular parasites that have developed unique modes of invasion and development within the host. Key biological processes and events in the biology of these parasites are enabled by a number of specific ultrastructural features. Invasive forms (zoites) are highly polarised cells, sharing an apical complex of specialised secretory organelles that facilitate successful invasion of the parasite into its host cell. Once inside their host cell, the mechanisms used by Apicomplexan parasites to replicate differ dramatically from those used by their hosts. Closed mitosis is combined with a budding process to produce variable numbers of daughter cells that do not derive from fission but instead are assembled within the mother cell. These fundamental differences between host and parasite suggest that cell division could be a potential target for therapeutic drug development.The present study will mainly focus on a putative serine/threonine kinase, named Tg269730 in Toxoplasma and PF3D7_1145200 in Plasmodium, that appears to be essential for parasite survival and whose localisation and expression profile implies a role in the biogenesis of the parasite invasion machinery during the budding phase of intracellular replication. To elucidate the function of Tg269730 and PF3D7_1145200, a series of genetic and biochemical experiments are planned to address the following questions:1) What is the subcellular localisation of Tg269730? Super-resolution imaging will be performed on a Toxoplasma strain that contains an epitope tagged form of Tg269730. Colocalisation using several established markers of parasite division and organelles will be used. In addition, immunoelectron microscopy will be performed on a similarly tagged synchronisable Toxoplasma strain. Live microscopic imaging will also be performed if a fluorescent protein tag is tolerated and does not alter the localisation of the protein.2) Does Tg269730 play a role in the lytic cycle? What is the functional role of Tg269730? To answer these questions, a conditional gene disruption (Tet-off system) as well as expression of a conditional dominant negative (destabilisation domain, DD system) will be used to examine the phenotypic consequences of loss of Tg269730 function.3) Is Tg269730 a bona fide kinase? A wild type or mutant (dead) kinase domain of Tg269730 will be expressed in recombinant form and its phosphorylation activity will be studied in vitro using biochemical approaches.4) What is the subcellular localisation and functional role of the Plasmodium orthologue, PF3D7_1145200? For this purpose an epitope tagged version of the kinase will be generated to P. falciparum using recently developed genetic tools (CRISPR-Cas9 system) and a conditional knock-out will be performed using the recombinase-mediated DiCre system. The phenotype resulting from the disruption of PF3D7_1145200 will be analysed by microscopic and videomicroscopic examination of the various developmental stages in the blood stage lifecycle. All the work will be performed at University of Montpellier where expertise in a wide range of techniques and analysis applied to the study of Toxoplasma has been demonstrated (Lebrun laboratory) and where novel tools to generate rapid genetic modifications in P. falciparum (CRISPR-Cas9 system) have been developed (Lopez-Rubio laboratory).

There is increasing evidence that the underlying cause of disease is a perturbation of earlier developmental processes, but the mechanisms of normal adolescent brain development are poorly understood. Here, I propose a project to decipher the genetic programs involved in the neural changes occurring during adolescence. I will focus my analysis on parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons in the mouse cortex, as this cell type is a likely important contributor in shaping the adolescent maturation phase. I will implement a recently developed method to generate quantitative RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from PV-interneuron populations from pre- and post-adolescent stages. Analysis of these data will reveal differentially expressed genes that might be responsible for adolescent changes in PV cells. Furthermore, to perturb the expression of the identified genes and their related genetic pathways, I aim to develop a platform for efficient, cell type-specific gene editing, using a virus-based Cre-recombinase (Cre)-dependent CRISPR/Cas9 system. The findings from the RNA-seq screen and the efficiency of gene editing will be validated experimentally by advanced in situ hybridization for RNA analysis. This project has the potential to uncover the genetic programs underlying the adolescent brain maturation process and to reveal novel targets for further functional analyses of neurodevelopment.

The two most important species, Theileria annulata and Theileria parva cause tropical theileriosis and East Coast fever (ECF) in cattle, respectively. T. parva alone is estimated to account for the death of >1 Mio cattle each year in sub-Saharan Africa with a substantial socio-economic impact and loss of US$ >300 Mio. One of the hallmarks of disease is the proliferation and dissemination of infected host cells into various organs. After tick transmission of sporozoites, leukocytes get invaded, followed by the development of schizont-forming parasites, and host cells acquire properties otherwise only known from cancer cells such as resistance to apoptosis, uncontrolled proliferation and metastatic potential. Despite considerable research efforts to link phenotypic changes and perturbed host cell signaling pathways, TaPIN1 is the only characterized Theileria effector protein to date that has been shown to contribute to host cell transformation. This absence of knowledge can mainly be attributed to a lack of genetic tools and a Theileria genome of ~4000 genes, half of which have no predicted function. In contrast, an arsenal of effector proteins has been discovered over the past decade in the highly tractable Toxoplasma system that hijacks host signaling pathways and takes control over gene expression. We aim to identify and characterize the function of novel Theileria effector proteins and explore how they interfere with cell signaling pathways and gene regulation that promote host cell transformation. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of genomic-scale analysis, the power of CRISPR/Cas9-based reverse genetics, a high throughput pathway analysis panel, life cell imaging and mass spectrometry. The specific aims of this proposal are (1) Identification of Theileria effector proteins and associated host cell manipulation; (2) CRISPR-based knockout of identified effector proteins; (3) Characterization of the host-pathogen protein interaction network. The characterization of novel Theileria effectors will be a fundamental step forward for the understanding on how Theileria transforms cells and causes disease. This knowledge may lead to improved interventions designed to reverse host cell transformation, thereby improving immune control of Theileria infection. It may also add new insights into cell physiology and pathway alterations in cancerous cells.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Ambizione	895928.0	CHF

This proposal aims to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying the substantial phenotypic variability observed in Joubert syndrome (JBTS), a neurodevelopmental Mendelian disorder part of the ciliopathy spectrum. To achieve this goal, the first step of the proposed research plan combines two experimental models with complementary strengths, namely zebrafish mutants and CRISPR/Cas9 genome-edited human induced-pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons, to compare the molecular consequences of loss-of-function in 4 different JBTS genes. This will untangle the shared effects of their loss-of-function from their diverging gene-specific effects. Second, I will take advantage of the variety of cilia-types present in zebrafish, mirroring the situation in humans, to investigate tissue-specific functions for each of the 4 genes. Finally, by generating zebrafish mutants carrying mutations in more than one gene, I will determine the combined effect of these mutations on the phenotypic outcome to investigate genetic modifiers. The enhanced understanding of the molecular consequences of JBTS gene mutations resulting from this work will increase our predictive ability for individual patients and set the stage for development of specific therapies.

I have recently shown a disproportionate large contribution from low-frequency genetic variants in ALS. ALS is not simply a collection of unique rare diseases with a monogenetic cause nor is it a diagnostic continuum with a complex contribution of thousands of small effect factors. ALS is in-between, which I call “simplex”, where in each patient a few, considerably strong genetic factors with or without environmental factors are at play. ALS mutations are characterized by reduced penetrance, variable clinical expressivity, have specific pleiotropic clinical features and interact with environmental factors. These phenomena are unexplained, but provide me with important and new opportunities in order to unravel the clinical, genetic and biological heterogeneity in ALS. I have created new research fields to go an important step beyond the state of the art: Splitting by lumping uses novel machine learning algorithms to reclassify patients using clinical pleiotropic features, environmental factors and blood epigenetic profiles to identify novel ALS mutations. Imaging genomics overlays patterns in ALS-associated brain morphology on MRI with brain gene-expression patterns to find ALS mutations. ALS risk in 3D integrates data on three-dimensional folding of DNA with genetic data to identify causal mutations and mutation-to-mutation interaction. ALS genomic modifiers in 3D identifies modifiers of C9orf72 mutations through the development of cellular reporter assays and CRISPR-Cas9 based screens. Genomic findings are translated using cellular models which can be used for targeted and unbiased drug screens. If successful, my approaches can be applied beyond the scope of this ERC and will have a clear impact on clinical trial design and genetic counselling in ALS in particular.

Recent literature suggests that microglia, which mediate synaptic pruning during brain development, can be responsible for synapse loss in neurodegeneration. Although the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, growing evidence indicates that dysfunctional microglia affect synapses number and function in pathology. Genome-wide association studies reveal that the majority of risk genes associated with neurodegenerative disorders are highly expressed in microglia. While such studies clearly implicate these cells in the pathogenesis of the disease, little is known about the causal mechanisms that link microglial risk variants to loss of synapses. We will identify the molecular mechanisms involved in microglia-mediated synapse loss. We will also generate novel in vitro and ex vivo models of ‘risk microglia’, by introducing genetic variants associated with cognitive impairment –alone or in combination- specifically in microglia, taking advantage of CRISPR/ Cas9 genome editing techniques. These goals will be achieved by combining cutting-edge transcriptomics and proteomics with mouse models of intense synaptic remodelling, to reveal the unique molecular signature of ‘shaper microglia’. A multidisciplinary approach will allow the extensive characterisation of risk models, by combining metabolic analysis, synaptic phagocytosis and degradation assays, with super-resolution microscopy, and novel genetically encoded labelling methods. With the knowledge generated here, we aim at developing and validating in vivo novel drugs- and nanobodies-based approaches for effective targeting of pathological pruning. In summary, REMIND will focus on: 1) Identifying molecular players in microglial-mediated synapse loss 2) Generating ‘risk microglia’ models, to asses the role of genetic variants associated with neurodegeneration 3) Developing novel strategies for targeting prunining	European Research Council	Starting Grant	1499991.0	EUR
352	Dr David Hughes	University of St Andrews	None	2018-05-01	2021-04-30	Posttranslational control of our innate immune response: exploring a novel role for ISGylation.	Our preliminary data shows that ISGylation is critical for regulating our innate immune response to infection and that distinct (E3 ligase-specific) modification pathways are necessary. Our objectives are to i) identify what E3 ligase and which ISGylated protein(s) are required for a regulated antiviral response using a combination of CRISPR/Cas-edited cell lines and proteomics and ii) characterise the antiviral response when ISGylation is compromised (quantitative proteomics). Viral infections trigger a profound cellular response that comprises the induction of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) aimed at limiting the infection. Many ISGs target the infection, while others coordinate the cellular response and a dysregulated response is pathogenic, thus its tight control is critical. Inherited ISG15-deficiency was recently identified in patients with autoinflammatory interferonopathies and typically these patients exhibited elevated ISG expression in the absence of infection. Hence, the interferon-inducible, ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 was identified as a new regulator of the antiviral response. ISG15 can functions as a 'free' molecule or as a posttranslational modification (ISGylation). We have generated ISG15-deficient cells and confirmed the dysregulated expression of ISGs, recapitulating what is observed in patient cells. Importantly, only when we reconstitute the ability of these cells to posttranslationally ISGylate proteins is this response controlled. Additionally, this control was independent of the HERC5-ligase, suggesting that alternative E3 ligases, and specific ISGylated protein(s), are necessary for a regulated antiviral response. Together, our research programme brings a new dimension to our understanding of innate immune regulation and to ubiquitin-like protein biology as a whole.

Although there is steady progress in resolving the functions of unknown genes, the identities of most secondary metabolites in poplar remain unknown. The lack of metabolite identities in experimental systems is a true gap in information content, and impedes obtaining deep insight into the complex biology of living systems. The main reason is that metabolites are difficult to purify because of their low abundance, hindering their structural characterization and the discovery of their biosynthetic pathways. In this project, we will use CSPP, an innovative method recently developed in my lab, to systematically predict the structures of metabolites along with their biosynthetic pathways in poplar wood, bark and leaves. This CSPP method is based on a combination of metabolomics and informatics. In a next step, the CSPP tool will be combined with two complementary genetic approaches based on re-sequence data from 750 poplar trees to identify the genes encoding the enzymes in the predicted pathways. Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) will be made to identify SNPs in the genes involved in the metabolic conversions. Subsequently, rare defective alleles will be identified for these genes in the sequenced population. Genes identified by both approaches will then be further studied either by crossing natural poplars that are heterozygous for the defective alleles, or by CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing in poplar. The functional studies will be further underpinned by enzyme assays. Given our scarce knowledge on the structure of most secondary metabolites and their metabolic pathways in poplar, this large-scale identification effort will lay the foundation for systems biology research in this species, and will shape opportunities to further develop poplar as an industrial wood-producing crop.

354	Dr. Cornelia VESELY	Medical University of Vienna	None	2019-08-05	2022-08-04	Adjusting the base: (Epi)transcriptomic RNA modification in inflammation & host-microbiome crosstalk	The recognition of widespread and diverse RNA modifications and their influence on genetic information has sparked epitranscriptomic research with impact on biology and medicine. The most abundant modification known is RNA-editing by adenine to inosine deamination, found in all classes of RNAs but rRNAs. Editing is essential, as deletions of the responsible deaminases ADAR1 or ADAR2 are lethal in mice. Mutations in ADAR1 cause aberrant sensing of self-RNAs leading to the autoinflammatory Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. Inosines are interpreted as guanosines. Thus, editing can recode mRNAs or retarget microRNAs. For instance, the mRNAs encoding Filamin-a (FLNA) and Filamin-b (FLNB) undergo a glutamine to arginine recoding in their C-termini. FLNA editing levels vary across tissues, reaching almost 90% in the gut. Besides a link to smooth muscle cell contraction consequences of FLNA editing are largely unknown. Our preliminary data show that RNA-editing ameliorates inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colon cancer. In the gut host and microbiota constantly communicate, partially by secreted microRNAs but also by RNA modifications. Thus, RNA-modifications will regulate and affect the host-fecal microbiota crosstalk also impacting IBD. We could already demonstrate an altered microbiome in FLNA editing deficient mice. Organism-wide RNA-editing can suppress inflammation by inhibiting the RNA sensor MDA5. Potentially, also other MDA5 related helicases are involved in modification-dependent protection from hyperinflammation. Here, we aim to study the role of FLNA mRNA editing in IBD and cancer and the impact of microRNA editing and modifications on the host-microbiota crosstalk. Lastly, the role of helicases in discriminating self vs. non-self RNA will be investigated. Results will advance the field of epitranscriptomic research and potentially serve as a basis to diagnose or treat IBD and colon cancer. The questions will be addressed using a wide spectrum of methods. State-of-the-art mouse models of IBD and cancer will be combined with microbiota analysis in rescued ADAR knockout mice and mice expressing constitutively edited/unedited FLNA. Transcriptomics will identify key edited or overexpressed microRNAs, which will be further explored by generating mice with inducible, tissue-specific editing by CRISPR/Cas9, a completely novel approach. Finally, the involvement of RNA helicases in the ADAR1-MDA5 axis will be explored by an innovative CRISPR screen. The involved researchers have highly complementary expertise. CV will focus on transcriptomics and RNA-editing molecular biology, FP is a microbiologist specialized in microbiota research, FE is an experienced immunologist and KC, a co-inventor of CRISPR/Cas9, will focus on genome engineering of cutting edge mouse models. Each aspect of the project stands on its own and will enable researchers to significantly consolidate their career and independence.

Up to 10% of severe early onset obesity has an identified monogenic cause. We showed that studying the disease in consanguineous Pakistani pedigrees enriches for homozygous variations, increasing the likelihood of finding causative mutations. Using this approach, we have identified that homozygous and compound heterozygous loss of function mutations in ADCY3, which encodes for adenylate cyclase 3, and homozygous mutations in the gene ROCK1, which encodes for Rho-kinase 1, are linked to severe obesity. In this proposal, we will study both these genes in detail, as well continue our search for other new obesity candidates. Given the role of the brain in the regulation of body-weight and food intake, we will molecularly characterize these genes in human neurons. Using single nucleus RNAseq, we will identify human neurons expressing ADCY3 and ROCK1. We will characterize the heterogeneity of the neurons and define markers for different populations. We will use RNAscope single molecule FISH to map where both of these genes are expressed within the human hypothalamus. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, we will 'knock-in' the ADCY3 and ROCK1 mutations that are associated with obesity into human pluripotent stem cells and then differentiate them into hypothalamic neurons. In the cells with ADCY3 mutations, we will study the effect on the primary cilia and leptin responsiveness. In the cells with ROCK1 mutations, we will measure leptin and insulin responsiveness. Using single cell RNAseq, we will examine the transcriptomic consequences of the mutations on the neurons. Using CoDE-seq, an augmented whole-exome sequencing approach that additionally enables the accurate detection of CNVs, we will continue to further identify candidate genes associated with severe obesity. Where the weight of evidence dictates, these will be molecularly characterized as above. Our aim is to uncover novel appetitive control pathways and reveal new potential therapeutic targets to tackle obesity.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	1014003.0	GBP
357	Professor Robin Ketteler	University College London	None	2019-09-01	2022-09-01	Targeting autophagy dependence in pancreatic cancer	The main aim of this proposal is to identify novel small molecule compounds for treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This will be acheived through a combination of compound screening and hit validation in three-dimensional cell models for pancreatic cancer. The two main aims are: 1. To validate ATG4B as a drug target in PDAC using genetic loss of function studies in 2D and 3D cell models. 2. To identify chemical compounds that reduce ATG4B activity in 2D and 3D cell models. Aim 1: We will assess a panel of pancreatic cancer cell lines for their suitability to model autophagy in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. To do this, we will develop tools for generating a loss of function phenotype, using CRISPR/Cas9 mediated editing of the ATG4B locus and introduction of a dominant negative version of ATG4B (C74A) in the endogenous locus. We will then generate 3D spheroid models of pancreatic cancer cell lines and test their response to the induction of stress. We will investigate the effect of ATG4B inhibition in the genome edited cell line in 2D tissue culture and in the 3D spheroid model and determine whether loss of ATG4B will result in enhanced cell death under stress conditions. Aim 2: Using computational docking studies, several hundreds of thousands of compounds will be assessed for their potential to bind to the active site of ATG4B. This will lead to the identification of 500-1000 hit candidates that require testing in experimental assays. Using our automated robotic Labcyte Echo550 Access platform, we will screen the hit compounds for their inhibitory activity using a biochemical ATG4B protease assay. We will use a cell-based luciferase release assay that we previously developed (Ketteler et al. 2008) to assess inhibition of cellular ATG4B activity. This will narrow down the number of hit compounds from 500-1000 to <100. These will then be assessed for their potential to inhibit growth and autophagy in the 3D pancreatic cancer model developed in aim 1. Overall, a successful outcome will be the demonstration that ATG4B inhibition provides a benefit in pancreatic cancer models, and the identification of ATG4B inhibitors for further progression in a hit to lead drug discovery programme.

Samples will be processed immediately for epithelial cell purification using magnetic bead sorting and generation of intestinal organoids according to established protocols. DNA and RNA will be extracted simultaneously. NLRC5 promoter DNA methylation analyses will be performed using bisulfite pyrosequencing and expression of NLRC5 as well as MHC-I related genes tested using RT-PCR and western blotting. Exposure of organoids to IFN-gamma will determine the impact of DNA methylation on the inducibility of MHC-I signaling. Locus specific, targeted de-methylation will be performed using a CRISPR/Cas9 based method and correlation between DNA methylation and clinical phenotype investigated using various computational approaches. Objective 2: We will generate NLRC5 knock-out and over-expressing human gut organoids using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and piggyBac transposon-based vector system respectively. Organoids from healthy individuals obtained from 2 gut segments will be modified and co-cultured with IFN-gamma. Following, we will perform genome wide expression (RNAseq) and proteomic Tandem Mass Tag profiling on organoids. Generated data will be analysed using novel computational methods such as diffusion-based approaches, which will allow identification of NLRC5 and/or IFN-gamma dependant signalling pathways operative in the human intestinal epithelium. Objective 3: In order to assess the functional impact of NLRC5 expression and MHC-I signaling on the intestinal epithelium in health and CD we will test intestinal epithelial barrier by measuring Transepithelial Electrical Resistance and efflux of FITC-dextran across organoids grown as monolayers. Additionally, we will test innate host response to viral infections and co-culture blood derived CD8+ T-cells with gut organoids and study their interaction using two-photon microscopy.

In particular CRISPR/Cas9 provides a tool-set thousands of researchers worldwide now utilize with unprecedented ease to edit genes, catalysing a broad range of biomedical and industrial applications. Gene synthesis technologies producing thousands of base pairs of synthetic DNA have become affordable. Current gene editing technology is highly effective for local, small genomic DNA edits and insertions. To unlock the full potential of this revolution, however, our capacities to disrupt or rewrite small local elements of code must be complemented by equal capacities to efficiently insert very large synthetic DNA cargos with a wide range of functions into genomic sites. Large designer cargos would carry multicomponent DNA circuitry including programmable and fine-tuneable functionalities, representing the vital interface between gene editing which is the state-of-the-art at present, and genome engineering, which is the future. This challenge remained largely unaddressed to date. We aspire to resolve this bottleneck by creating ground-breaking, generally applicable, easy-to-use technology to enable docking of large DNA cargos with base pair precision and unparalleled efficiency into mammalian genomes. To achieve our ambitious goals, we will apply a whole array of sophisticated tools. We will unlock a small non-human virus to rational design, creating safe, flexible and easy-to-produce, large capacity DNA delivery nanodevices with unmatched transduction capability. We will exploit a range of techniques including Darwinian in vitro selection/evolution to accomplish unprecedented precision DNA integration efficiency into genomic sites. We will use parallelized DNA assembly methods to generate multifunctional circuits, to accelerate T cell engineering, resolving unmet needs. Once we accomplish our tasks, our technology has the potential to be exceptionally rewarding to the scientific, industrial and medical communities.

However, our knowledge on developmentally controlled PCD in plants remains fragmentary, despite its undoubted significance for plant growth and reproduction. My team has established the Arabidopsis root cap as a novel model system for developmental PCD in plants. This model has enabled us to identify a gene regulatory network controlling the preparation of PCD. However, the molecular processes that terminate the vital functions of a plant cell during the final steps of PCD execution remain unknown. Exploiting the accessibility of the root cap for live-cell analysis of PCD execution, we obtained preliminary data revealing an unexpected succession of distinct membrane permeabilization events in which the endoplasmic reticulum breaks up before the central vacuole. I hypothesize that this sequential de-compartmentalization is the mechanism underlying the irreversible and orderly execution of PCD. Recent advances in several key technologies provide unprecedented opportunities to test this hypothesis and make a quantum leap in our understanding of the mechanisms carrying out PCD execution. I will employ correlative super-resolution light and electron microscopy to analyse PCD execution in unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution. RNA sequencing of single cells at the onset of PCD execution will provide information on the genes that are required for this rapid process. Advanced proteomics techniques will provide a direct route to identify proteins acting on membrane permeabilization during PCD execution. Lastly, multiplex and tissue-specific mutagenesis via innovative CRISPR screens will enable me to overcome genetic redundancy and lethality in the PCD context. The detailed understanding of plant PCD execution generated by this research program will shed light on a fundamental principle of plant development and open new avenues for crop improvement and protection.

Other typical OI features such as blue sclerae, dentinogenesis imperfecta and hearing loss are not consistently present. Homozygous mutations in TMEM38B gene encoding for a potassium channel (TRIC-B) are responsible for the disease. TRIC-B is present in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane of non excitable cells and allows the potassium ions to move from the cytosol to the ensoplasmic reticulum (ER), thus acting as positive charge exchanger required for the exit of positive calcium ions from the ER without altering the potential membrane. Calcium homeostasis is very important for cellular function. The exact molecular mechanism linking the loss of TRIC-B function to the skeletal phenotype in OI type XIV is still unknown. The aim of our research will be to develop and use in vitro and in vivo models to test the hypothesis that altered proliferation and differentiation caused by altered intracellular calcium concentration could be causing OI type XIV bone fragility. The TMEM38B gene will be knocked out by CRISPR/Cas9 genomic engineering tool in an immortalized human osteoblast line widely used as model for osteoblastogenesis investigation. Proliferation and differentiation will be evaluated in control and mutated cells. To confirm our in vitro data we plan to generate a zebrafish model for OI type XIV using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology to knock out tmem38b gene. The success of the targeting will be demonstrated at the gene and protein level and mutant zebrafish bone phenotype will be investigated to validate it as model for OI type XIV. If successful the project will allow the identification of some of the molecular mechanism responsible for OI type XIV and will provide useful in vitro and in vivo tools for future investigation of the disease mechanism	Telethon Italy	Telethon Exploratory Project	47350.0	EUR
362	Dr Danielle Paul	University of Bristol	None	2018-04-01	2020-06-03	Cryo-Electron microscopy of cardiac thin filaments: Heart disease on a molecular level	The main components of cardiac thin filaments are actin and the regulatory proteins troponin and tropomyosin which confer Ca2+ sensitivity. All of these proteins can carry mutations related to heart disease. Aims My aim is to understand the process of muscle regulation and the effects of mutations at a molecular level. This requires high resolution structures of the macromolecular complex. Cryo-Electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) provides a means of achieving sub-nanometer 3D structures of these filaments that cannot be crystallised. 3D maps of the thin filament in different functional states will provide insight into the mechanism of regulation. In addition, I intend to look at the difference in the secondary structure of the proteins caused by mutations that are known to cause Cardio myopathies. Objectives • Isolate native thin filaments from zebrafish cardiac muscle. The wild type filaments will be prepared in a relaxed (Calcium free) and active (Calcium treated) state. • Use CRISPR technology to engineer in cardio myopathy causing mutations in zebrafish. Isolate native thin filaments from mutants • Freeze these samples in amorphous ice preserving their native state. • Image the frozen samples using the new 200kVTalos Artica Cryo-TEM and Gatan K2 detector at Bristol. • Carry out a non-helical single particle analysis of the data enabling all of the information regarding the regulatory proteins to be recovered. • Dock known crystal structures into the 3D density maps resulting in atomic models of the thin filament.

363	Dr. Maria KALYNA	University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna	None	2017-05-20	2020-05-19	Global Profiling of cancer-associated exitron splicing	Alternative splicing is a key mechanism to increase the diversity of expressed information in eukaryotic genomes generating multiple transcript and protein variants with different fates and functions from a single gene. Tight control of alternative splicing is very important as evidenced by linkage of abnormal alternative splicing with numerous human diseases including cancer. Exon skipping/inclusion is the major alternative splicing event in human, therefore genome-wide studies of cancer-associated alternative splicing have been well focused on detection and characterization of this type of event. Recently, we have discovered unusual alternative splicing that we termed exitron (exonic intron) splicing. Exitrons are internal regions of protein-coding exons and have features of both exons and introns. Exitron splicing results in protein isoforms with altered sequences and often affects protein domains and various post-translational modification sites. Strikingly, at least 3.7% of human protein-coding genes contain exitrons as evidenced by analyses of seven tissue and one breast cancer transcriptomes. Here we propose a project based on our findings that 1) exitron splicing involves genes with reported functions in cancer; 2) exitron splicing broadly affects features of proteins encoded by cancer-related genes; 3) mutations affect exitron splicing in cancer-associated genes; and 4) ~9% of exitron splicing events are misregulated in breast cancer involving genes with implicated functions in cancer. We aim to elucidate a link between exitron splicing and cancer so far never explored in different cancer types. To this end, we will identify misregulated exitron splicing events in various solid tumours by using publicly available RNA-seq datasets. We will use RT-PCR and Lariat-seq, extensive sequencing of splicing-derived lariat RNAs, to validate exitron splicing. We will examine functional relevance of misregulated exitrons regarding their effects on protein isoform features. We will test impact of misregulated exitron-retained/spliced isoforms using siRNA/CRISPR-mediated knockdown/outs together with various functional assays. We are interested to elucidate basis of exitron splicing regulation. The unique feature of exitrons as intra-exonic sequences implies specific recognition mechanism and requirements for regulating their splicing. Hence, we will investigate splicing regulatory elements and splicing factors implicated in exitron splicing. We assume that exitron splicing takes place on mature spliced mRNA via mRNA re-splicing, and we will examine this hypothesis. Taken together, this project will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of alternative splicing. Identified set of exitron splicing events will complement the repertoire of the known alternative splicing events misregulated in cancer and may lead to the development of novel cancer markers and/or therapeutic targets. The main researchers responsible for this project are Maria Kalyna (Department of Applied Genetics and Cell Biology at BOKU, Vienna, Austria) and Akila Mayeda (Institute for Comprehensive Medical Science at Fujita Health University, Aichi, Japan).

364	Dr Thomas Vaccari	Universita degli Studi di Milano	None	2018-04-01	2021-09-30	Identification of novel drug targets in the Notch pathway that are relevant to tumor formation	Recent work in Drosophila melanogaster has revealed a central role of the endo-lysosomal compartment in Notch signaling activation. However, endo-lysosomal Notch signaling is ill-understood in mammals and strategies to counteract it have not emerged yet, limiting our ability to act on tumors arising from Notch signaling alterations. We postulate that endo-lysosomal Notch signaling might play a yet unrecognized important role in Notch-dependent tumorigenesis that awaits experimental exploration. In Task 1, we aim to study 30+ new drug targets that we have identified in a recent screen for trafficking regulators of Notch in human cells. For this, we have established a pipeline for quantitative assessment Notch trafficking and activation. New genes that are found to act in the endo-lysosomal activation process will be modulated in specific Notch-dependent cancer cell lines, upon depletion or by pharmacologic treatment. In Task 2, the Drosophila homologs of the most promising ones will be analyzed to determine their effect on Notch-dependent tumorigenesis using genetic assays in vivo. For such effort, we will generate mutants by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and will study them using Notch and endocytic assays that recapitulate features of tumorigenesis in vivo. In task 3, based on the indications of task 2, we will use Drosophila as a host for tumor transplantation and drug testing. In summary, we will identify new regulators of endo-lysosomal Notch signaling, understand their role in tumorigenesis, and characterize their potential pharmacologic modulators. At a time in which clinical therapies based on targeting Notch signaling are still an unfulfilled promise, detailed understanding of Notch events associated to the endo-lysosomal system will be key to devise more effective and less toxic pharmacologic options.

We will combine our expertise in iPSC technology and optic cup differentiation with our understanding of AIPL1 function to model human AIPL1 LCA, to develop and test novel pharmacological and RNA-directed therapeutic strategies targeting the most common classes of AIPL1 mutations. iPSC will be derived from LCA patients homozygous for the c.834G>A(p.W278X) mutation by episomal reprogramming of renal epithelial cells. The c.834G>A mutation will be corrected by genome editing in the patient-derived iPSC using the CRISPR/Cas9 system followed by targeted homologous repair (HDR) with an AIPL1-specific piggyBac transposon. Patient-derived iPSC and control isogenic iPSC will be differentiated to retinal photoreceptor cells via the formation of 3D optic cups. Translational read-through inducing drugs (TRIDs) will be tested for their efficacy for recoding premature termination codons and rescuing the expression and function of full-length AIPL1 in vitro (p.R32X, p.W72X, p.W88X, p.Q163X and p.W278X) and in c.834G>A(p.W278X) patient-derived ocular cups. AIPL1 mutations disrupting a canonical splice donor dinucleotide (c.276+1G>A, c.276+2T>C) or consensus splice donor sequence (c.465G>T, c.642G>C, c.784G>A) will be targeted with modified complementary and exon-specific U1 snRNA. The rescue of transcription of the full-length gene, and expression and function of the AIPL1 protein, will be assessed in vitro and in optic cups derived from an LCA patient compound heterozygous for c.276+1G>A and a patient homozygous for c.624G>C(p.K214N). In situ splice site editing in optic cups will be achieved via direct delivery or viral transduction. Validation of these therapies in vitro and in patient-derived ocular cups will be critical for translation into the clinic, with broader application of our proof-of-concept findings to other inherited retinal dystrophies.

In particular, mirroring their unparalleled morphological and cellular complexity, vertebrate brains show the highest levels of regulated AS known in nature. However, the functions of most of these alternative transcripts, and the evolutionary impact that the increased transcriptional complexity has had on the evolution of the vertebrate brain are still widely unexplored. In this project, we will investigate the functions and evolutionary impact of neural AS in vertebrates. We will focus on neural-specific alternative exons that are highly conserved across vertebrate groups (suggesting functional importance), but that are not conserved in invertebrates, and are thus vertebrate-specific genomic novelties. We will term these exons Vertebrate- and Neural-specific Alternatively Spliced (VN-AS) exons. Through a combination of bioinformatics, experimental manipulation in models species, and systems-level network analysis, we aim to: (i) Comprehensively identify VN-AS exons, and study their regulation during vertebrate neurogenesis and nervous system development, using RNA-seq and comparative genomics; (ii) Probe the phenotypic impact of VN-AS exons on vertebrate nervous systems, using the CRISPR-Cas technology for genome editing; and (iii) Investigate how VN-AS exons rewire protein-protein interaction networks in vertebrate neurons - an emergent molecular function for AS -, and whether this rewiring underlies novel functions of VN-AS exons in the vertebrate brains. This project will thus deliver fundamental insight into two major unanswered questions: (i) what are the functions of transcriptomic diversification, and (ii) how does transcriptomic diversification impact organismal evolution. Our results will fill a large gap of knowledge in our current understanding of brain evolution and development, providing a complementary angle to traditional gene expression studies.

This project will use the genetically amenable Toxoplasma gondii as a model to study the architecture and function of the apical complex. T. gondii can be readily genetically modified by targeted recombination, allowing gene-tagging with reporters, inducible protein knockdowns by promoter swaps, and gene knockouts. Detailed phenotypic investigations of cell morphology, ultrastructure, growth, invasion and replication will be undertaken to characterise the behaviour and functions of individual apical complex structures. These procedures are all established in the Waller laboratory. Identification of novel apical complex proteins will use three independent approaches. 1) Comparative bioinformatics using known peripheral cytoskeletal proteins from related ciliates. 2) Proximity-dependant biotinylation, using either promiscuous biotin ligase (BirA*) or modified peroxidases (APEX) fused to known apical complex proteins, to tag and identify further new components of this structure. 3) Immuno pulldowns of interaction partners of known apical complex proteins. Protein locations will be validated, and a detailed structural and behavioural model of the apical complex will be made using reporter-tagged proteins and live cell imaging, immuno-fluorescence (including with 3D-SIM super-resolution microscopy) and electron microscopy. Functional dissection of apical complex proteins will be undertaken by inducible knockdown (tetracycline-responsive promoter replacement and controllable degradation domains), and gene knockouts using modified versions of the Cre/Lox recombinase system, and CRISPR gene excision. The effects of selective protein depletion will be measured and characterised by high-resolution microscopy and sensitive assays for parasite growth, replication and invasion processes (e.g. invasion efficiency, cell motility, regulated microneme and rhoptry protein secretion). These approaches will allow thorough interrogation of apical complex assembly and function.	Medical Research Council	Research Grant	450791.0	GBP

Aim 1: to characterize activin receptor expression in vivo by immunofluorescence during developmental myelination and remyelination (both toxin- and immune-based lesion models). Aim 2: to determine the activin receptor subtype driving OPC responses relevant for myelination and remyelination, by CRISPR-mediated genomic deletion of specific receptor subtypes and analysis of OPC responses in vitro and following transplant into myelinating and remyelinating ex vivo brain explants, and receptor-specific pathway activation assessed by phospho-antibody microarrays. Aim3: to test effects of additional ligands either known to, or predicted to, bind activin receptors on OPCs, first by assessing expression during myelination/remyelination in vivo and then screening detected ligands for their potential to stimulate OPC responses using high throughput image acquisition and signalling pathway activation as above. Aim 4: to elucidate contribution of activin receptor signalling in OPCs to myelination and remyelination, by generating a constitutive and inducible OPC-specific conditional knockout for the activin receptor required for all activin receptor signalling, respectively, and crossing to reporter mice for analysis of knockout OPCs. OPC responses and myelination will be analyzed by immunofluorescence and ultrastructural analysis. Sufficiency of activin receptor stimulation in driving remyelination will also be tested by activin receptor ligand supplementation to demyelinated brain explants (to delineate effective concentrations) and in vivo to focal lesions of the central nervous system. I envisage that this research will impact therapeutic strategies to promote myelin repair in human myelin disorders such as multiple sclerosis to decrease clinical impairments, by targeting activin receptors on OPCs.

General aim To interrogate the role of V(D)J recombination defects in Common Variable Immunodeficiency Disorders Background The Common Variable Immunodeficiency disorders (CVIDs) comprise a group of heterogeneous primary antibody deficiencies and form the most clinically significant antibody failure in adults and children. For the majority of CVID patients the condition is sporadic, heterogeneous and polygenic. We have applied whole genome sequencing techniques to a small cohort of spor adic CVID patients in order to develop analysis pipelines for studying this cohort. Our preliminary findings reveal multiple variants in the DNA repair pathway, in particular the V(D)J recombination associated genes. Specific aims 1 To use next generation sequencing techniques to identify V(D)J recombination defects on CVID patients. 2 To establish a causative link by mimicking identified defects in fibroblast cell lines using the CRISPR-Cas9 system and studying the functional effect, by analysing expression and radiosensitivity using the gH2AX assay. 3 To link the genetic and functional defects back to the clinical phenotype. Significance The expected outcome is the identification of a subgroup of CVID patients with defects in V(D)J recombination explaining their complex phenotype. This will lead to better stratification, earlier diagnosis and potential new treatments targeting the DNA repair pathway.	Wellcome Trust	Seed Award in Science	97324.0	GBP
371	Dr Pleasantine Mill	University of Edinburgh	None	2018-04-01	2023-03-31	Genetic and cellular basis of functional cilia assembly	Ciliopathies are a diverse class of human genetic diseases, with over 20 recognized syndromes caused by mutations at ~100 different loci. While mammalian cilia are ubiquitous and highly conserved structures, the clinical features associated with their dysfunction are highly pleiotropic with varying degrees of severity and penetrance among tissues. While the causative genes are now being rapidly identified, the cellular and developmental basis for this phenotypic complexity remains poorly understood and controversial. In this programme we aim to: 1. Investigate the cellular pleiotropy of ciliopathies by determining why different cell types vary in their vulnerability to mutations affecting cilia, despite their ubiquity. To better understand cilial diversity and how this results in variable phenotypic consequences upon ciliary dysfunction, we are building tools to interrogate clinically relevant cilial types at a molecular, structural and physiological level. We are engineering a series of precisely-targeted in vivo proximity labelling tracers to common cilial transport machineries and novel cilial biosensors to track cilial dynamics in vivo, in healthy and diseased states. 2. Develop therapeutic strategies for somatic gene editing in ciliopathies, focusing on improving delivery to the correct cell type, and biasing editing of intragenic mutations to therapeutically beneficial events. The recent therapeutic game-changer for rare human genetic disease is the possibility of gene correction using targeted CRISPR technology for precise and efficient corrective genome-editing. If targeted to the most relevant cell type(s), this offers the possibility of a somatic cure for some genetic diseases in which affected cell types are accessible, such as the postnatal airways (affected in primary ciliary dyskinesia: PCD) and the eye (affected in retinitis pigmentosa: RP). Importantly both PCD and RP are characterized by their staggering polygenic natures: over 40 and 100 genes are implicated in PCD and RP respectively, which complicates a conventional “one-size-fits-all” gene therapy for all patients. In contrast, therapeutic gene editing could be personalized based on an individual’s genetic mutation(s). However, there remain at least two sizeable obstacles to making gene editing a therapeutic reality, namely (a) targeted delivery of the editing machinery and (b) improving repair efficiency. To address these problems, we have developed fluorescent reporter mouse models that allow a sensitive read-out of gene-editing events in time and space, which we will use to investigate how best to target cells of interest safely and in a therapeutically effective manner. Our aims fully align with the Unit’s mission to understand genetic disease and disease mechanisms, as well as its emphasis on the genome and brain biology: our whole organism approach is essential for understanding why different tissues or organs are particularly susceptible to perturbation across the wide phenotypic spectrum of human ciliopathies.

372	Dr. Isabella RAUCH	University of California	None	2016-01-01	2017-05-31	Intestinal epithelial NAIP/NLRC4 function in infection	Understanding how the immune system detects gastrointestinal pathogens - NAIP/NLRC4 function in the intestinal epithelium during infection Understanding how the immune system detects gastrointestinal pathogens such as enterohaemorrhagic E. coli and Salmonella is crucial for our deeper insight into immune processes at barrier sites as well as to develop therapies for these pathogens. Inflammasomes are a family of multiprotein cytosolic complexes that activate host defense upon pathogen detection. The NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasomes detect specific bacterial proteins in the host cell cytosol. In the mouse, NAIP1 detects the needle protein of bacterial type 3 secretion systems (T3SS), NAIP2 detects T3SS inner rod proteins, and NAIP5 and NAIP6 detect bacterial flagellin. Human NAIP detects T3SS needle proteins. Upon detection of their cognate ligands, NAIPs co-assemble with a downstream protein called NLRC4 that recruits and activates the Caspase-1 protease. Caspase-1 initiates inflammation by cleaving and activating pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1? and -18) and by inducing a lytic form of cell death called pyroptosis. Most of our current knowledge on NAIP/NLRC4 function stems from in-vitro experiments using cell lines and macrophages. We hypothesize (1) that inflammasomes function in diverse cells types, including epithelial cells, and have specialized functions in each cell type; and we hypothesize (2) that NAIPs are essential for NLRC4 function and that distinct Naip paralogs have unique functions in vivo. To address these hypothesis, we propose to use several innovative and unique mouse models for in vivo experiments: (1) mice sufficient for NLRC4 only in certain tissues, created using traditional knock-in technology combined with cell specific Cre-expression. This allows addressing the function of NLRC4 in intestinal epithelial cells compared to myeloid cells in a model superior to conditional deficiencies. (2) Mice with specific NAIP deficiency created using the recently developed CRISPR/Cas9 method of genome modification. These specific deficiencies will enable us to compare evolutionary differences in pathogen detection between mouse and human and to learn about the consequences of detection of different bacterial structures. Using these models, we plan to elucidate the role of NAIP/NLRC4 in infections with Citrobacter rodentium, which is an established mouse model of attaching and effacing bacterial infections in humans (as caused by enteropathogenic/ enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EPEC/EHEC)) and Salmonella. The project, performed by me at the University of Berkeley, California will add essential knowledge to the field of gastrointestinal immunology and enable me to acquire cutting edge skills in the field of genome modification as well as expand my training in immunology, with a focus on inflammasome biology. These skills, and the establishment of collaborations with leading North American scientists, will lead to significant career development and transfer of valuable knowledge to the Austrian research community.

HYPOTHESIS: 1)The androgen receptor (AR) and androgen receptor splice variants (ARsv) bind druggable co-regulatory proteins through their N-terminal domain (NTD). 2)Co-regulatory proteins that bind the NTD of AR/ARsv are critical for transactivation of AR/ARsv, prostate cancer (PC) cell growth and resistance to current therapeutic strategies in CRPC. 3)Targeting AR/ARsv co-regulatory proteins is a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of CRPC. AIMS: 1)To identify druggable co-regulatory proteins that bind to AR and ARsv through their NTD in CRPC cell lines. 2)To determine which co-regulatory proteins are critical for AR/ARsv transactivation and CRPC cell growth utilising high-throughput siRNA and drug screens. 3)To validate these co-regulatory proteins of AR/ARsv using CRISPR and canSAR to support the pursuit of drug discovery efforts and develop novel therapeutic strategies for treating CRPC. RELEVANCE: PC is the commonest male cancer (41,000 diagnosed in 2010) and the second commonest cause of male cancer death (10,700 died in 2010) in the UK [1]. Surgery and/or radiotherapy can cure early PC. However, 30% of patients recur and >20% of patients present with advanced disease. The current standard of treatment is androgen ablation therapy [2]. Despite initial robust responses, nearly all patients progress to fatal CRPC with AR transcriptional reactivation. This occurs, in part, through constitutively active ARsv lacking a ligand-binding domain (LBD) [3, 4]. The most important of which is androgen receptor variant-7 (ARv7) against which all currently available endocrine agents have minimal activity [5]. There is now an urgent clinical need for therapeutic strategies that regulate AR and ARsv by targeting the AR NTD.	Prostate Cancer UK	Fellowship	30000.0	GBP

Poor understanding of its pathophysiology has led to few effective treatment options. MD is one of few genetically determined dystonias caused by fully penetrant, autosomal dominant mutations (epsilon-sarcoglycan gene, SGCE), providing a unique opportunity for investigation. Previous studies suggest that disruption of the nigro-striatal junction, specifically dopamine-2-receptor (D2R) function, is central to pathogenesis. My previous work involved detailed phenotyping of a large MD cohort (n=30). Two mutation types will be used to develop induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines: nonsense (c.289C>T,p.Arg97X) and missense (c.622G>A,p.Gly441Asp) mutations. Methodology IPSC lines will be generated using Sendai virus vector techniques and differentiated using dual SMAD inhibition and Activin A into midbrain dopaminergic and striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) respectively. Characterisation of the neuronal models will include measurement of dopamine synthetic enzymes, transport proteins and the density and distribution of dopamine receptors. A co-culture platform of the two neuronal cell types will undergo phenotyping using electrophysiological techniques, calcium imaging and detailing of dendritic spine morphology. Control neuronal models will include those from healthy, unrelated individuals and isogenic 'rescue' cell lines of the MD patient samples by use of CRISPR technology. Scientific and Medical opportunities This project provides an excellent model system with which to investigate the cellular mechanisms that underlie dystonia pathogenesis. Findings from this work will inform future studies, particularly the identification of novel therapeutic targets.	Medical Research Council	Fellowship	717566.0	GBP

However, the directly converted cells are not stable, and the vast majority of iPSCs exhibit poor developmental potential as measured by stringent pluripotency tests. This suggests that the prevailing method of reprogramming is not ideal and leads to aberrant/incomplete conversion. To improve the quality of the converted cells, efforts should be focused on uncovering the molecular mechanisms that characterize the nuclear reprogramming process. There are two critical hurdles that hinder the progress of deciphering the elements that dictate successful reprogramming: (1) The ability to detect and capture solely the rare cells that eventually will be converted and (2) to monitor the transcriptional profile of cells at the single-cell level. Single-cell technology is in its infancy and many of the methods used today are characterized by high noise to signal ratio. In this grant proposal we intend to overcome these limitations by (1) establishing a complex fluorescent knock-in reporter system using the CRISPR/Cas9 method to capture the early rare reprogrammable cells and by (2) employing several cutting-edge single-cell technologies, RNA-Seq, Fluidigm BioMark and single-molecule mRNA-FISH, to segregate the real signal from the noise. To identify common and more global elements that facilitate nuclear reprogramming at large, we will trace in parallel, reprogrammable cells from two different somatic cell conversion models that reach high degree of nuclear reprogramming, and analyse their transcriptome using sophisticated bioinformatic tools. This study will provide a general overview of the changes that occur during the conversion of various cell types and will uncover the basic features that are essential to reach safe and complete conversion.

In order to develop future therapies that target this pathway to treat diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration, further research is required to understand the mechanism of cargo selection, its mode of regulation, and its role in facilitating phenotypic alterations. Autophagy requires the integration of multiple signals, proteins, and lipids in order to identify the appropriate substrate, form the autophagosome, and fuse with the lysosome to degrade its cargo. This proposal will aim to elucidate the role of one such protein adaptor implicated in the autophagy pathway, Toll-interacting partner (TOLLIP), which has a crucial role in regulating both endocytic and autophagic cargo and their trafficking to the appropriate subcellular compartment. This project will utilise CRISPR-Cas9 gene knockout approaches and reconstitution experiments in an established human cell line to evaluate TOLLIP’s mechanistic role during autophagy.

Interestingly, I have recently shown that fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 signalling can also be triggered under non-stimulated conditions. This occurs when proteins with Src homology 3 (SH3) domain bind its C-terminal proline-rich-motif (PXXP) and modulate its activity to induce a homeostatic or oncogenic response. Whether this occurs in other receptors remains unclear. .Notably, the genome encodes for >50 PXXP-containing receptors and >300 SH3 domain-containing proteins. Thus, I will test the hypothesis that SH3-PXXP interactions are abundant and critical for functional regulation of receptors which dictates cellular response. I will use 2 model receptors to: 1. Generate short biotinylated PXXP-peptides immobilized on streptavidin-coated-beads to “fish-out” bound proteins from cell lysates. I will then employ mass-spectrometry to determine the identity of the SH3 domain-containing hits (to be validated by CRISPR/Cas9 pull-downs and fluorescent-lifetime-imaging). 2. Run pilot biophysical experiments like microscale thermophoresis to reduce confounding elements such us complex formation rather than direct SH3-PXXP binding events. 3. Evaluate functional modulation of receptors by running Reverse-Phase-Protein-Array and functional assays. This project will set the foundation for characterizing novel interactions to enhance our understanding of signalling mechanisms; with impact on structural modelling of receptors and cancer therapeutics.

There are currently no treatments to cure or even to slow the course of these diseases. In this proposal, we aim to determine the molecular mechanisms by which disease-causing variants give rise to neurodegeneration in HSP. We will generate the world’s first in vivo models of HSP which endogenously express patient-specific gene variants via CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in Drosophila. By integrating disparate genetic, proteomic and imaging analyses of these novel models, we will identify how HSP-causing variants alter protein expression, localisation and interaction. Furthermore, we will establish the clinical relevance of identified mechanisms by studying disease-causing variants in human cellular models of HSP. The synergistic findings from fly and human models of HSP will greatly enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning these neurodegenerative disorders. In the future, the models generated through this proposal will provide: 1) valuable investigative resources for studying the cellular events underlying neurodegenerative disease and 2) a unique method in which to screen for innovative therapeutic approaches for these devastating disorders.

We are interested in spacer acquisition in the CRISPR-Cas system and have shown how Cas1-Cas2 captures foreign DNA. We plan to solve the structure of the complete integrase complex to understand how it binds target DNA and inserts protospacers into the CRISPR locus. Cas4 is also involved in spacer acquisition in some CRISPR types. We will identify the structural basis of acquisition in Cas4-containing systems and elucidate the roles of Cas4. In addition, we plan to identify the unknown RNase that trims crRNA from its 3’-end, and address the molecular mechanism of RNA-induced silencing in type III systems. Our previous study suggested that bacteria have a DNA interference system. We demonstrated the molecular mechanism of DNA-guided DNA interference using structural and functional studies. We will now focus on the guide DNA biogenesis pathway. Ago also has potential to be a genome editing tool due to its sequence-specific DNA cleavage activity. We will optimize the TtAgo sequence to screen for mutants which have high cleavage activity at 37°C.	Wellcome Trust	International Research Scholar Award	500404.17	USD

Understanding the genetics of cholangiocarcinoma has been hampered by relatively small sample sizes, where whole exome sequencing (WES) has yielded a broad mutational profile that does not provide a standout mutational signature that can be targeted therapeutically. In this study, we aim to use computational tools to conduct a combined analysis of 413 cholangiocarcinoma WES datasets. We will then define driver mutations from this dataset using algorithms that predict the likelihood of a mutation being oncogenic. These computationally derived mutations will be used to conduct a forward genetic screen in bile duct organoids using Cas9/CRISPR, the expectation is that neutral mutations will be filtered out and we will to derive a list of impacting, functional oncogenic mutations. This combination of in silico and in vitro methodology will determine bona fide oncogenes from a highly-triaged list of candidate mutations. Whilst we are focused on cholangiocarcinoma, this methodology will be important in identifying oncogenes in other rare cancers or cancers which have diverse mutational spectra.

Platelets, through the interaction with lymphatic endothelial cells, lead to the separation of the blood and lymphatic vasculatures throughout embryonic development and into adulthood. However it is not understood how this interaction maintains the separation of the two vasculatures and how platelets guide lymphatic endothelial cell behaviour. Previous research has focused on the generation of mouse models which lack the versatility available from other model organisms such as Zebrafish. We have identified Zebrafish orthologues of the key molecules involved in the separation of the lymphatic and blood vasculatures and have demonstrated that they form complexes with other membrane associated proteins.We will develop a Zebrafish model to determine the mechanistic basis underlying the separation of the blood and lymphatic vasculatures. We hypothesize that membrane complexes regulate the cellular behaviour of lymphatic endothelial cells. Complex members will be identified using biological mass spectrometry and their spatial distribution quantified using two-colour dSTORM super resolution microscopy. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology will introduce gene disruptions and mutations into the Zebrafish genome allowing the mechanistic basis underlying the separation of the blood and lymphatic vasculatures in vivo to be determined.This proposal will lead to mechanistic insight underlying the separation of the lymphatic and blood vasculatures by platelets and will develop a model with the translational potential to assess the impact of therapeutic compounds on the separation of these two vasculatures in vivo.

We contribute to a new strategy by genetically modifying insect vectors, sandflies (Lutzomyia longipalpis) and triatomine bugs (Rhodnius prolixus), leading eventually to transgenic insects resistant to disease agents. We will use two different transgenic approaches, piggyBac and CRISPR-Cas9. PiggyBac is a method for semi random insertion of exogenous DNA into the genome. CRISPR-Cas9 is a new and highly targeted method to manipulate genes in a manner not previously possible. • Microinjection of insect embryos with piggyBac plasmids to obtain insects expressing fluorescent markers for subsequent CRISPR-Cas9 knockout experiments facilitating easy monitoring of outcomes. • Knockout of fluorescent markers (above), using CRISPR-Cas9 constructs, demonstrating that system components are functional and that we can precisely target genes of interest. • Knockout of endogenous genes by CRISPR-Cas 9 that are non-essential or important in sustaining infection in insect vectors. • Insertion and expression of exogenous DNA (fluoresence markers) using CRISPR-Cas9 harnessing homology directed repair facilitating inheritance to offspring at levels above mendelian inheritance (gene drive). Pilot outputs offer real prospects for developing powerful approaches of interrupting disease transmission.	Wellcome Trust	Seed Award in Science	75106.0	GBP

Established very early in human development, body weight regulation is brain-governed by the hypothalamus. Consequently, genetic variants acting by disrupting hypothalamic function lead to severe obesity. However, the manner in which these variants contribute to obesity via exerting neurodevelopmental and molecular changes has been difficult to study since human brain tissue is inaccessible. Historically, rodent models have extensively contributed to our understanding of energy homeostasis, but they carry inherent limitations due to inter-species differences in brain structure and physiology, as well as gene sequences. Therefore, development of human study systems for disease modelling is an important complementary approach to animal and patient studies aimed at investigating human obesity. We propose to use several novel methodologies: precise genome engineering with CRISPR/Cas9 in stem cells, 2D hypothalamic cultures, as well as 3D brain organoids, to: (1) generate physiologically relevant cellular and tissue models of human genetic obesity; (2) investigate neurodevelopmental aspects of the disease; (3) utilise the models to study molecular mechanisms leading to obesity.

The NEAT1 isoforms, NEAT1_1 and NEAT1_2, are expressed from the same promoter but undergo differential processing and play non-overlapping and sometimes even opposite roles in cellular (patho)physiology. NEAT1 isoforms are promising therapeutic targets, however, their contribution to the human pathology remains poorly understood. This is largely due to the lack of adequate tools, both biological and pharmacological, for their differential analysis. The aim of this project is twofold: to generate reporter cell lines allowing quantitative analysis of NEAT1 isoforms; and to develop and validate a cellular assay for identification of NEAT1 modulators. Two strategies, both using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, will be applied to create stable reporter cell lines for monitoring NEAT1 isoforms in living cells. In the first setting, endogenous NEAT1 transcripts will be fluorescently labelled using either the MS2 system or the RNA aptamer Spinach2. The second strategy will involve a protein labelling approach, where endogenous proteins SFPQ and NONO, which form a heterodimer upon NEAT1_2 interaction, will be tagged with fragments of a self-complementing fluorescent reporter. One reporter line will be selected as a platform to develop an assay for medium-throughput identification of molecules targeting NEAT1 isoforms. Finally, a proof-of-principle screen using a commercial library of physiologically active compounds will be performed to validate this cell-based assay. Thus, this project will yield scalable tools for NEAT1-focused research and drug discovery.	The Academy of Medical Sciences	Springboard Round 4	99293.0	GBP

However, we still do not fully understand how they keep the immune system in check, or why they fail to function in autoimmune diseases, such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Although modern therapies have improved outcomes in autoimmunity, they are not always effective and often come with severe side effects. A better understanding of how Tregs are altered in autoimmunity will lead to better therapies. T cell activity is dependent on co-receptors, and targeting specific co-receptors is a successful approach for immunotherapy. In preliminary studies I found that Tregs in JIA synovial fluid (SF) express high levels of co-receptors, and that the microenvironment is rich in their ligands. Thus, I hypothesize that altered co-receptor signalling in Tregs could contribute to their dysfunction in autoimmunity. My research will focus on the co-receptor pair CD226 and TIGIT: two co-receptors highly expressed on Tregs but with poorly characterized function in these cells. I will establish signalling, receptor-receptor and receptor-ligand interaction models and study their effects on Treg function. I will generate T cell and Treg lines with specific knockout (CRISPR-Cas) and overexpression (lentiviral) of CD226 and/or TIGIT to delineate receptor-specific roles. I will assess whether Treg signalling via CD226 and TIGIT is altered in autoimmunity by utilizing SF samples from inflamed JIA joints. Additionally, I will assess the impact of mutations in the CD226/TIGIT pathway, or accessory molecules, found in primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) presenting with autoimmune features. Lastly, I will test whether modulating the CD226/TIGIT pathway in patient-derived Tregs is a suitable therapeutic approach to restore immune-balance in autoimmunity. Determining how Treg function is controlled by co-receptors will increase our understanding of immune tolerance and may lead to new drug targets for JIA and other autoimmune conditions.

LATOS	Medical University of Vienna	None	2019-05-01	2022-04-30	Role of ARID1A in endometrial cancer organoid model	Endometrial cancer is the most prevalent gynaecological malignancy in developed countries and the incidence rates are steadily increasing. Endometrial cancer is associated with a number of mutations including those in components of the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway, in KRAS and in ARID1A. ARID1A is a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex and although ARID1A is the most frequent target of mutations in endometrial tumours, the mechanism by which its inactivation promotes tumorigenesis is unclear, not least due to the lack of a suitable experimental model. Recently, we and others have established 3D endometrial organoid cultures that faithfully recapitulate the architecture, expression patterns, hormonal responsiveness and secretory abilities of the in vivo endometrial epithelium. We propose to employ this system to elucidate the function of ARID1A in human endometrium and its role in initiation and progression of endometrial cancer. Using loss of function experiments, expression analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we aim to identify the set of genes directly regulated by ARID1A in human endometrial epithelium. To gain novel insights into the ARID1A mode of action we seek to determine ARID1A protein interactors using immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. We expect to identify transcription factors that recruit ARID1A (as part of the SWI/SNF complex) to specific genomic loci as well as endometrium-specific subunits of the SWI/SNF complex. In addition, we will test the hypothesis that oestrogen signalling contributes to progression of the ARID1A-deficient endometrial tumours. Moreover, we aim to generate an organoid model of endometrial cancer by introduction of mutation in ARID1A, KRAS and/or PIKCA3 genes using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. We will follow effects of these mutations on niche factor dependency, organoid growth and tumorigenicity upon transplantation into mice and in the context of high estrogen signalling. Overall, here we propose to use a unique, comprehensive approach by combing mechanistic advances with functional assays in a novel cancer model system to understand the role of ARID1A in endometrial biology and malignancy.

PD pathogenesis is driven, at least in part, by defects in proteostasis and mitochondrial function, leading to degeneration of dopaminergic axons and neuronal death. Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) such as GDNF can protect and restore dopaminergic axons. However, attempts to deploy NTFs ectopically in therapy models, or to increase proteostasis and mitochondrial function, have met with only limited success. I hypothesize that instead of ectopic application, over-expression of relevant pathways restricted to physiologically appropriate cells provides a potent therapeutic approach to treat PD. I have made significant progress toward this goal by targeting the 3’UTR in the mouse Gdnf gene, thereby increasing expression levels without affecting the gene’s spatiotemporal expression pattern. Using this approach I have shown that elevation of endogenous GDNF levels protects mice from experimentally induced PD. Unlike ectopic GDNF application, it causes no side effects. Importantly, I have established that GDNF levels can be elevated by 3’UTR targeting in adulthood, suggesting that this strategy could be applied in humans late in life. I will use 3’UTR targeting to study the therapeutic potential of overexpressing endogenous genes, using transgenics and CRISPR-Cas9‒mediated 3’UTR editing in adult mice. First, I will increase the expression of NTFs in adult mice with experimentally induced PD. Next, I will upregulate genes important in mitochondrial function and proteostasis and test whether concurrently upregulating endogenous NTFs is a viable approach for treating PD. Third, I will use 3’UTR targeting to create a mouse model of PD in which alpha-synuclein is overexpressed, for better validation of my therapeutic strategy. Collectively, these experiments should establish proof of concept for a revolutionary, safe and effective treatment for PD.	European Research Council	Consolidator Grant	1999987.0	EUR

Before implantation, the hatched ungulate blastocyst must undergo dramatic morphological changes characterized by cell differentiation, proliferation and migration processes leading to the development of extra-embryonic membranes, the appearance of a flat embryonic disc and gastrulation. This prolonged preimplantation development is termed conceptus elongation and deficiencies on this process constitute the most frequent cause of reproductive failures in ungulates, including the 4 most relevant mammalian livestock species in Europe. The purpose of this project is to elucidate the factors involved in conceptus elongation by gene editing and in vitro culture approaches. A first objective will be to identify key genes involved in differentiation processes by RNA-seq analysis of different embryo derivatives from bovine conceptuses at different developmental stages. Subsequently, the function of some of the genes identified as well as others known to play a crucial role in mouse development or putatively involved in embryo-maternal interactions will be assessed. For this aim, bovine embryos in which a candidate gene has been ablated (KO) will be generated by CRISPR and transferred to recipient females to assess in vivo the function of such particular gene on conceptus development. A second set of experiments pursue the development of an in vitro system for conceptus elongation that would bypass the requirement for in vivo experiments. For this aim we will perform metabolomics and proteomics analyses of bovine uterine fluid at different stages and will use these data to rationally develop a culture system able to sustain conceptus development. The knowledge generated by this project will serve to develop strategies to enhance farming profitability by reducing embryonic loss and to understand Developmental Biology questions unanswered by the mouse model.

Mouse TSCs are a well-established model system that can be manipulated in vitro to interrogate molecular mechanisms controlling trophoblast differentiation. Pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia and HELLP (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count) Syndrome are particularly linked to defective formation and behaviour of invasive endovascular trophoblasts that enhance maternal blood supply to the foetus. Our preliminary analyses (see Case for Support) suggest formation of this essential trophoblast subtype is heavily influenced by BAF complex chromatin remodelling factors. I recently showed the chromatin landscape undergoes widespread changes during TSC differentiation. We will continue to exploit mouse TSCs to understand how BAF chromatin remodelling complex bromodomain(BRD)-containing proteins BRG1, BRM and BAF180 influence the chromatin landscape and thus trophoblast cell fate and behaviour by: 1) Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene knockout and a highly potent and specific small molecule inhibitor specifically targeting BRG1, BRM and BAF180 BRDs, coupled with RNA-seq and qRT-PCR profiling of well characterized markers of individual trophoblast subtypes; 2) Profiling BRG1, BRM and BAF180 chromatin binding locations using ChIP-seq in control and BRD-attenuated trophoblasts; 3) Profiling BAF complex-dependent chromatin accessibility using ATAC-seq on control, BRG1, BRM, BAF180 and BRG1;BRM CRISPR knockout and BRD-inhibited trophoblasts; 4) Determining the composition of BRG1-, BRM- and BAF180-containing protein complexes in wild type trophoblasts using co-IP with mass spectrometry. This will provide valuable insights into trophoblast subtypes controlled by BAF complexes, how they control use of cis-regulatory sequences and their molecular mechanism of action.

391	Amandine Grimm	Queensland Brain Institute The University of Queensland	Queensland Brain Institute The University of Queensland	2017-04-01	2018-09-30	Dissecting the dendritic function of Tau protein and the Src kinase FYN, two proteins implicated in Alzheimer’s disease	BACKGROUND: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder worldwide, affecting 2% of the population in industrialized countries. The disease is marked by the presence of extracellular plaques - composed of aggregated amyloid-ß peptide (Aß) - and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) - consisting of aggregates of abnormally hyperphosphorylated Tau protein. Recent studies showed that Aß and abnormal Tau protein may interact and have synergistic toxic effects, leading to neuronal death in AD, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Although Tau was primarily described as an axonal protein stabilizing microtubule function and assembly, new findings obtained in the laboratory of Professor Jürgen Götz at the University of Queensland (Australia) identified a dendritic function of this protein that seems to be crucial in mediating Aß toxicity at the postsynaptic compartment. Indeed, Tau is required for the targeting of FYN, a Src kinase widely expressed in the hippocampus, to dendritic spines. FYN phosphorylates the GluN2B subunit of the NMDA receptor, which is essential for recruiting the postsynaptic density (95kD) protein (PSD95). This enhances the stability of the receptor complex at the synaptic membrane, which boosts the excitotoxic signaling induced by the presence of Aß. Interestingly, in absence of Tau, the targeting/clustering of FYN is massively reduced in the dendritic spines and, vice versa, when tau is pseudo-phosphorylated at distinct phosphorylation sites (AT180 - 12E8 - PHF1 - S396/S404), targeting of Tau and FYN to spines is markedly increased. Together, this identifies a cross-talk between the two molecules which we intend to further dissect in the present proposal.HYPOTHESIS: Thus, based on the previous and preliminary data obtained in the laboratory of Prof. Götz, the overarching hypothesis of the project is that the subcellular localization, trafficking and clustering of FYN and Tau are tightly regulated in a physiological and pathological context (AD).AIMS: The specific aims of the present study are to prove our hypothesis and to enhance our understanding of the endogenous regulation of Tau and FYN trafficking to the dendritic spine. For this approach, a combination of technics (biochemical, pharmacological as well as super-resolution microscopy) established in the Götz laboratory, will be used to identify the mechanisms underlying the targeting of Tau and FYN at the spine, under physiological and pathological (AD) conditions. Especially, we will use novel gene-edited mouse strains created in the Götz laboratory with the TALEN / CRISPR technology, introducing a photo-convertible mEOS2 tag in-frame into the carboxy-terminus of either the Tau-encoding gene or the FYN-encoding gene. The fluorescence emitted by Tau-mEOS2 and FYN-mEOS2 will be analyzed using super resolution microscopy technics, including the single particle tracking photo-activated localization microscopy (sptPALM).Using these tools, we would like to pursue two main objectives as part of this program:Specific Aim 1: To determine the mobility of FYN and Tau in the somato-dendritic domain and spines: i) under physiological conditions; ii) after neuronal activation and; iii) in the presence of Aß.Specific Aim 2: To determine whether Tau controls FYN clustering (i.e. the formation of nanoclusters).IMPACT: The current approach opens the opportunity to dissect a novel fundamental mechanism and identifies how the two key molecules in AD, Aß and Tau, interact via FYN to exert their toxic effects. It uses state-of-the-art technology and has ramifications for additional neurodegenerative diseases with protein aggregation, as well as for the role Tau and FYN have in a physiological context and the identification of new therapeutic targets for the treatment of AD.

By contrast, some lower vertebrates, such as zebrafish, can perfectly reconstruct their damaged organs, such as appendages, heart, retina and spinal cord. Little is known about biological factors that permit or suppress the natural ability of organ regeneration. Our goal is to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms that generate new cells for fin and heart regeneration in zebrafish. We will focus on dedifferentiation processes that transform mature cells at the site of injury into a progenitor cell pool, called the blastema. An understanding of blastema formation and regulation both in the fin and heart will elucidate common principles of the regenerative machinery. On the other hand, we will investigate the factors stimulating cardiac cell proliferation and transient scar deposition after heart infarction. This undertaking will demand the use of existing methods, as well as developing novel research tools in adult zebrafish, such as the inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system technology.

The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene is a major oncogene in NB, and ALK activating mutations or wild-type (wt) expression are associated with poor clinical outcome. The implication of ALK-wt, and the ALK activating mutations, ALK-F1174L, and ALK-R1275Q, in NC progenitor fate and neuroblastomagenesis was previously investigated using immortalized murine neural crest progenitor cells (NCPC), MONC-1 and JoMa-1. In vivo studies by orthotopic (adrenal gland) implantations reveled that MONC-1 cells could generate various tumor types, such as NB, osteo/chondrosarcoma, and undifferentiated tumors. In contrast, MONC-1 cells expressing ALK-F1174L only produced highly aggressive undifferentiated NC cell-derived tumors, similarly to JoMa1 cells overexpressing ALK-wt, or activating ALK mutants. JoMa1-ALK-derived tumors expressed high levels of various stem cells (SC) and NC stem cell (NCSC) associated markers, confirming their stem-like and phenotypes, and suggesting an ALK-mediated impairment of NCPC differentiation potential in vivo.The specific objectives of the present project are to investigate the functional role of ALK and its downstream pathways in the control of NCPC differentiation potential and fate, as well as to elucidate the involvement of activated ALK in the maturation of the sympathoadrenal lineage and in NB differentiation. Using ALK-transduced NCPC cell lines described above in combination with specific ALK and ALK signaling pathways inhibitors, we will investigate the influence of activated ALK signaling on NCPC differentiation capacity and fate in vitro. To increase our knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms and transcriptional controllers involved in ALK-mediated blockage of NCPC differentiation in vivo, we plan to investigate the global epigenetic patterns and the expression profiles associated to NB orthotopic tumors-derived from MONC1 cells as compared to undifferentiated tumors-derived from MONC-1-ALK-F cells. The role of putative ALK target genes, Myc and Twist1/2, or of newly identified key transcriptional regulators in the control of NCPC differentiation will be explored by means of specific inhibitors and/or silencing strategies through CRISPR/Cas9. In addition, a special focus will be dedicated to the involvement of ALK deregulated activation in the differentiation and maturation of normal sympathetic neurons and adrenal chromaffin cells, using ALK-mutants knock-in mice, as well as in NB cell differentiation potential using ALK overexpressing NB cell lines. Moreover, clinical NB samples will be examined to identify a possible correlation between ALK expression level and/or localization, and neublastic cell differentiation status within individual tumors.This project will be performed within an established collaborative international team of experts in NC development (Prof. L. Sommer and Dr O. Shakhova), in the molecular genetics of NB (Drs I. Janoueix-Lerosey and G. Schleiermacher), in NB orthotopic modeling (Dr J.-M. Joseph), in NB histopathology (Dr M. Peuchmaur), and in epigenetic regulation of solid tumors (Dr N. Riggi). This study should provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms responsible for dysfunctional NC cell maturation responsible for NB development, and may contribute to the identification of new therapeutic options.

394	Arnold von Eckardstein	University of Zurich	Institut für Klinische Chemie Universitätsspital Zürich	2015-06-01	2018-05-31	Role of Scavenger Receptor BI and Endothelial Lipase in the Transendothelial Transport of High Density Lipoproteins	Background: High density lipoproteins (HDL) and their main protein constituent and precursor, apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), exert several atheroprotective actions within the vascular wall, notably the removal of cholesterol from macrophage foam cells for reverse transport to the liver. However, it is little understood how HDL and apoA-I pass the endothelial barriers to reach and leave the arterial intima with the lipid laden macrophages. We have previously found that aortic endothelial cells bind, internalize and resecrete apoA-I and HDL by processes that are modulated by the ATP binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1, respectively, as well as the scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI), endothelial lipase (EL), and the ectopic F0F1-ATPase/P2Y12 axis. We have not yet unravelled the mechanisms by which these proteins contribute to endothelial transcytosis of HDL. For this proposal we will focus on the role of SR-BI and EL.Working hypothesis: SR-BI and EL are HDL binding proteins that mediate the internalization of HDL either directly as an endocytic receptor (notably the SR-BII splice variant of SCARB1) or indirectly by transducing signals to an endocytic machinery (SR-BI via its PDZ or cholesterol sensing domains) or generating signaling molecules (EL by generating lysophosphatidylcholines or exposing S1P). Specific aims: In two subprojects we want to answer the following two questions: 1. How do SR-BI and EL regulate the internalization and trafficking of HDL through endothelial cells? 2. Do EL and SR-BI modulate transendothelial transport of HDL in vivo? Experimental design: For amswering the first question we will generate human aortic and lymphatic endothelial cell lines (HAEC and HLEC) with knock-outs of the SCARB1 and LIPG genes using the CRISPR/Cas system. The SCARB1 ko cell line will be knocked-in with either of the two isoforms SR-BI or SR-BII or with two SR-BI mutants which lack the signaling PDZ domain or the cholesterol sensing activity. The LIPG1 ko cells will be knocked-in with either wild type EL or an enzymatically inactive EL mutant. After confirming the endothelial phenotype the individual cell lines as well as the effective knock-outs and knock-ins, the cells will be analyzed for their function to bind, internalize and transport HDL per se and after complementation with signaling molecules (EL knock-out and knock-in cell lines). These biochemical experiments will be complemented by fluorescence microscopy studies to unravel any erroneous trafficking of HDL. The cells will also be characterized for other responses to HDL, notably in nitric oxide production, VCAM-1 expression, apoptosis, endothelial repair, and phosphorylation of signaling molecules. The second question will be approached by comparing the kinetics of radiocatively labeled HDL and control proteins in SCARB1 ko mice, LIPG ko mice and wild type mice. We will inject radioiodinated HDL, albumin or LDL into the tail vein to monitor its appearance in the arterial wall and peritoneal cave as well as into the peritoneal cave or foot pads to monitor its appearance in plasma. We will also use two photon live microscopy to study the kinetics by which fluorescence labeled HDL and control proteins injected intravenously and subcutaneously appear in the interstial space and microvessels of the skin, respectively. Expected value: Our project will answer a key question on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, namely how HDL particles enter and leave the vascular wall. This process is a pre-requisite for the mediation of anti-atherogenic functions of HDL and therefore a potential target for anti-atherosclerotic drug therapy.

One type of chronic pain, neuropathic pain, is expected to affect more than 75 million of people worldwide. Neuropathic pain (NP) as defined by the IASP is a “Pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system”. This clinical syndrome may appear in the context of many different alterations of the peripheral and central nervous system; from radiculopathy induced by disk hernia, traumatic or compressive (tumors) nerve injuries, toxic, metabolic or infectious conditions (chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, AIDS-related pain, and so on) to multiple sclerosis, stroke or Parkinson disease. Neuropathic pain is associated with hyperexcitability of the central and the peripheral nervous systems, resulting in ongoing pain, allodynia (innocuous stimuli that become painful), hyperalgesia (exaggerated and prolonged pain response in response to noxious stimuli) and negative symptoms such as hypoalgesia. Increased neuronal activity can explain both spontaneous and exaggerated stimulus-evoked pain. In the nervous system, the excitability is mainly carried by voltage-gated sodium channels (Navs) that are responsible for the upstroke of action potentials. Navs are heteromeric glycosylated protein composed of a large pore-forming a-subunit and small ß-auxiliary subunits. Nine genes encode for distinct channel isoforms (Nav1.1 to Nav1.9) and all, except Nav1.4 and Nav1.5, are expressed in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) nociceptive neurons. In these neurons, Nav1.7 has been found to be the most expressed TTX-sensitive isoform compared to Nav1.1, Nav1.2, Nav1.3 and Nav1.6, and is coexpressed with the two TTX resistant isoforms, Nav1.8 and Nav1.9.In neuropathic pain, accumulation of Nav1.7, Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 was reported in the primary afference. In addition to this acquired pain syndrome, the contribution of Nav1.7 in inherited pain disorders has been recurrently reported. Congenital insensitivity to pain due to loss-of-function of the channel were first described in 2006 and since then other mutations have been reported. On the other side of the spectrum, multiple gain-of-functions mutations were shown to be associated with two exaggerated pain sensitivity pathologies, namely inherited erythromyelagia (IEM) and paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (PEPD). More recently, studies also highlighted a role for Nav1.7 in idiopathic small-fiber neuropathy (I-SFN); nearly 30% of patients suffering from this pathology presented a gain-of function mutation in Nav1.7. Small fiber peripheral neuropathy is a type of peripheral neuropathy that occurs from damage to C-fibers and A-d fibers that are the small unmyelinated and thinly myelinated peripheral nerve fibers belonging to nociceptive neurons. Since then, similar gain-of-function mutations in Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 have also been reported. I-SFN is not only accompanied with neuronal hyperexcitability but is also associated with axonal degeneration and neuronal death. Now what is hypothesized, but remains to be demonstrated is whether the hyperexcitability is responsible for the axonal degeneration. In vitro experiments confirmed that 1) these mutations induced modification of the biophysical properties of the different Navs in cell expression system and 2) led to DRG neurons hyperexcitability. These two combined approaches however present limitations. HEK cells do not express endogenous Navs proteins and are thus widely used to characterize the effect of a mutation on a particular canal biophysical properties. However the modulation of activity of the channel might significantly vary between different cell types and HEK cells do not necessarily reflect DRG neurons. Another limitation of cell expression system is that HEK cells no not express potassium channel, consequently the effect of these mutations on the overall cellular excitability cannot be investigated under current clamp mode (recording of action potentials is not possible). To study the effect of mutation on cellular excitability, another approach using primary culture of mice nociceptive neurons transfected with human Nav1.7 containing the specific mutation is commonly used. The main limitation of this approach is that the mutated human cDNA is expressed together with the two wild-type mice alleles; thus there is an interspecies gene coexpression and a contamination of the mutated cDNA with the endogenous allele. Another approach to investigate these single mutations of Nav1.7/1.8/1.9 would be to generate knock-in mice harbouring these mutations. But generating such knock-in mice line with the traditional approach is laborious and time consuming and has consequently never been performed in the pain field. It is well-known that upon repetitive stimulation of the primary afference, the input into the central nervous system will be potentiated. The synaptic strength between primary and secondary order neuron is increased, ultimately leading to the hyperexcitability of the dorsal horn nociceptive neurons. This process is referred to as central sensitization, a mechanism first described by Clifford Woolf, and that has been extensively studied since then. Nothing is known on the effect of the gain-of-function mutations of Nav1.7 on mechanisms of central sensitization. It is likely that the increased excitability observed in the periphery will also lead to a strengthening of the spinal cord input.AIMBecause the use of human cell lines and primary nociceptive neuron cultures both show limitations (discussed above) in AIM 1 we plan to investigate the effect of Nav1.7/1.8/1.9 I-SNF mutations on human nociceptor-like neurons excitability. We will also test the hypothesis of whether the hyperexcitability is responsible for the axonal degeneration observed in I-SFN.We will use a two-step experimental approach: 1) we will transdifferentiate human fibroblasts into nociceptor-like neurons and 2) we will use the clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system to generate these mutations in the aforementioned human nociceptive neurons. We will determine whether these mutated human nociceptive neurons also present a hyperexcitable phenotype using electrophysiology (using both voltage- and current-clamp and calcium imaging) similarly to what is observed with HEK293 cells and sensory neurons primary culture. We will then compare the observed electrical pattern with the one obtained from nociceptors derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with these mutations (from Ingemar Merkies, a collaborator of Prof. Woolf). The impact of these mutations on the cellular excitability using this approach will give results that are physiologically closer to what happens in humans and also provide a proof-of-concept that this new experimental approach is relevant. To have better insight on the in vivo effect of Nav1.7/1.8/1.9 I-SNF mutations, in AIM 2 we will also take advantage of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate knock-in mice harboring these mutations and test whether these mice develop I-SNF. We will use optogenetics, a tool that allows a very precise spatiotemporal control of neuronal excitability, to investigate how these mutations modify the cellular excitability of sensory neurons upon exogenous stimulation. In AIM3 we will again take advantage of optogenetics to investigate whether stimulation of nociceptors harbouring Nav1.7/1.8/1.9 I-SNF mutations with blue light strengthen the input into the spinal cord.Finally, as I extensively investigated Nedd4-2 effect on Navs turnover, in AIM 4 I will also use the CRISPR/Cas9 system to mutate this ubiquitin ligase in nociceptors-like human neurons and in mice and test the hypothesis that this leads to an increased neuronal excitability and pain hypersensitivity.

Tropen und Public Health-Institut	2016-10-01	2019-09-30	Characterization of the interaction network of exported proteins in Plasmodium falciparum	The rational to study the interaction network of exported proteins in Plasmodium falciparum lies in the crucial importance of the export of virulence factors to the surface of infected host cells and other modifications allowing the parasite’s survival in its host cell which are the sole cause of morbidity and mortality.P. falciparum, the deadliest form of malaria, exports during its blood cycle over 10% of its proteome into the host cell leading to major host cell modifications such as presentation of adhesins on the surface or change of membrane rigidity and permeability. Why the parasites need to export such large number of proteins is unknown and their interaction is not understood. Only for a small number of proteins a tentative function was determined and hardly any information on exported proteins in the transmission forms, the gametocytes exist.With this project, we aim to elucidate the dynamic interaction network of exported proteins in P. falciparum and their contribution to morbidity during the entire erythrocytic life cycle including gametocytes. Recent technical advances to genetically manipulate P. falciparum make this project more feasible. Using the CRISPR/CAS9 system we will generate knock out parasites of a number of selected exported proteins including a number of PHIST proteins, which were frequently found in the host cell and for which we have shown that they play an important role in anchoring the virulence factor PfEMP1 to the cytoskeleton. With this system but also the alternative selection linked transfection we will generate inducible knock down clones or introduce endogenous tags. All clones will be used for phenotypical analyses using an array of established and innovative methods (e.g. microsphiltration membrane rigidity measures, electron-microscopy for ultrastructural analyses). Protein-protein interaction will be identified using conventional immuno-precipitations but also the BioID system which introduces a promiscuous biotin ligase, which subsequently allows the identification of biotinylated proteins that were in close proximity of the protein of interest. Potential interactions will be confirmed and validated by various techniques such as NMR, fluorescent polarization experiments, fluorescence cross correlation spectroscopy, or split GFP system.We finally expect to obtain through this project an interaction network that is important for Maurer’s cleft function and transport and fixation of PfMP1 on the erythrocyte surface. In particular, we expect clarification of the function of PHIST proteins and their interaction with host cytoskeleton proteins.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Project funding (Div.

Uncontrolled proliferation and maturation arrest are hallmarks of leukemic blasts, the disease-defining cells. Current therapies mainly focus on the deregulated proliferation of blasts; an alternative therapeutic approach is to correct the differentiation defect of leukemia cells and drive the malignant cells into terminal maturation, as successfully exemplified in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a distinct subtype of AML. The overreaching objective of this proposal is to identify and elucidate new targets for differentiation in AML, with the ultimate goal of clinical translation.Specific aims include identification of new differentiation targets using state-of-the-art CRISPR-Cas screening in AML; validation of novel candidate proteins controlling myeloid maturation in multiple models of AML; and understanding the mechanistic role of new AML differentiation targets. This study will uncover a new group of potential therapeutic targets as prime candidates for drug development that will set the stage for future trials assessing differentiation therapies in AML.

In this proposal we strive to unravel how aberrant assembly of protein-RNA complexes may contribute to ALS neuropathology. For this purpose we will analyse the ability of TDP-43, an RNA-binding protein (RBP) commonly associated with ALS, to assemble on RNA transcripts in complex with additional RBPs. We hypothesise that the low complexity region (LCR) of TDP-43 coordinates binding to other RBPs and thereby promotes cooperative RNA interactions. The aim of our study is to elucidate how the composition of TDP-43/RBP complexes influences its affinity and specificity for different RNA binding sites, and thereby affects processing of neurologically relevant transcripts. The successful completion will address basic questions regarding the formation of RNA-protein complexes, and may also uncover new therapeutic avenues for ALS treatment. Our study will involve generation of isogenic cell lines (HEK Flp-In™ and CRISPR/Cas9-edited iPS cells) that will be used for state-of-the-art interaction studies (BioID, APEX, BLI) and development of a variant iCLIP method to elucidate how and where TDP-43 binds transcripts in disease-relevant models. The results of our studies are likely to strongly impact the fields of ALS and hnRNP biology.	Swiss National Science Foundation	Early Postdoc.Mobility	None	None

Heterogeneity within hematopoietic progenitor populations has considerably limited characterization and molecular understanding of lineage commitment in both health and disease. Advances in single-cell genomic technologies provide an extraordinary opportunity for unbiased and high resolution mapping of biological function and regulation. Recently we have developed an experimental and analytical method, termed massively parallel single-cell RNA-Seq (MARS-Seq), for unbiased classification of individual cells from their native context and successfully applied it for characterization of immune and hematopoietic progenitors. Here, we propose to uncover the hierarchy and regulatory mechanisms controlling hematopoiesis by combining comprehensive single-cell RNA-Seq analyses, modelling approaches, advanced functional assays, single-cell CRISPR screens, knockout models and epigenetic profiling. Exciting preliminary result show that indeed our approach is starting to uncover the complexity of hematopoietic progenitors and the regulatory circuits driving hematopoietic decisions. We will pursue the following aims: (i) Generate a refined model of hematopoiesis by comprehensive single-cell RNA-Seq profiling of hematopoietic progenitors, (ii) validate the predicted model by in vivo functional developmental assays and then (iii) test candidate transcription and chromatin factors uncovered by our model for their role in controlling progression towards various lineages using single-cell measurements combined with CRISPR screens. Together, our study is expected to generate a revised and high-resolution hematopoietic model and decipher the regulatory networks that control hematopoiesis. Our methods and models may provide a platform for future medical advancements including a large-scale European collaborative project to discover a comprehensive human hematopoietic tree.

Laboratory tests, often based on quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), require equipment, time, expertise and infrastructure, resulting in severe logistical challenges and ultimately resulting in inadequate testing. There is a critical need for diagnostics that can be rapidly deployed at the point-of-need (PON) to enable global surveillance of infectious diseases. Towards addressing this need, this project incorporates a new CRISPR-based approach called CRISPR Isothermal Amplification (CIA) that enables one-pot diagnostic amplification and detection of the SARC-CoV-2 virus at ambient temperatures. This scheme builds off innovations in cell-free synthetic biology and biosensing that enable rapid, low-cost, and PON detection of chemical contaminants and viral pathogens. The platform technology under development could serve several purposes from a quick-screen technology to inform triage and isolation strategies, to a clinical test used on the front lines. There is also the potential for the technology to eventually serve as an at-home test to help inform which subpopulations and sectors of the economy could safely return to productivity towards the end of the pandemic. In addition, the test has the flexibility to be rapidly reprogrammed to detect new emerging pathogens. This work is pursued in close collaboration with a commercial partner, Stemloop, Inc., in order to quickly transition the technology for manufacturing, deployment, and distribution.<br/><br/>This project employs a new CRISPR Isothermal Amplification (CIA) approach to enable a one-pot amplification and detection of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in an assay for the virus. CIA uses programmed Cas 13 systems to recognize SARS-CoV-2 RNA, trigger nucleic acid amplification and create a detectable output simultaneously in the same reaction where amplification occurs. Computational models of each process are developed alongside the experimental systems and used to guide optimizations to achieve attomolar sensitivity. The method is unique in that no DNA primers are required. The amplification and detection processes are designed to take less than one hour and cost less than one dollar per test to manufacture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

The equipment must be housed in a facility with electricity and freezers for storage of temperature sensitive materials and equipment operation. Lateral flow based assays are an alternative diagnostic tool that is inexpensive, temperature stable, user-friendly and has a faster turn-around-time (TAT). However, this platform takes longer to develop, with reduced specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy compared to molecular-based assays. An ideal diagnostic tool combines the adaptability and reliability of molecular assays with the TAT, cost-effectiveness, and stability of lateral flow. Clustered Regularly Interspersed Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) based diagnostics can provide these capabilities and revolutionize the field of point-of-need molecular-based diagnostics. Our goal is to develop CRISPR-based diagnostics to detect SARS-CoV-2 at the point-of-need, such as at the bedside, passenger screening, or returning travellers who may have been exposed. We recently demonstrated that CRISPR-based diagnostics is reliable, sensitive and can be used to detect Ebola virus and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and caused more than 69,000 infections and contributed to over 1600 deaths. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to quickly diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection to administer appropriate patient care and isolation. CRISPR-based diagnostics is a next-generation diagnostic tool that can provide results in a timely manner and fill this gap. Implementation of CRISPR-based diagnostics will complement our armamentarium against high-consequence pathogens and will address the need for faster, cheaper, and more robust diagnostics for emerging infectious diseases of public health concern.

Novel approaches are needed to tackle the increased morbidity caused by this disease and provide alternative options to the mechanical solutions currently available for terminal disease; such as joint replacement surgery. Tissue engineering approaches are needed to provide biological solutions for the treatment of OA without the drawbacks observed using inorganic materials. There have been significant advances in the ability to generate cartilage tissue in the laboratory from mesenchymal derived stem cells (MSCs) by controlling their differentiation into hyaline cartilage tissue. MSCs are readily isolated from various tissues, including adipose and peripheral blood, but most work has utilised bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs). BM-MSCs have been used with moderate success for the treatment of cartilage defects in animal models in their multipotent state or after differentiation into chondrocytes. As a cellular therapy MSC-derived chondrocytes are believed to offer the most potential. However, during current approaches to MSC-chondrogenesis the cells essentially undergo an endochondral ossification programme, in that cells can enter hypertrophy (characterised by their expression of type X collagen) and then further differentiate to osteoblasts or undergo apoptosis.(Zhong et al., 2015; Mwale et al., 2006) Mechanisms to adapt the progression of MSC-chondrogenesis, as occurs for articular chondrocytes, are likely to be of benefit for tissue engineering approaches to cartilage repair. The recent advance of CRISPR-Cas9 technology allows the manipulation of the human genome not just through genome editing - addition or deletion, but also through the activation or repression of the expression of specific genes; in this case those involved in chondrocyte differentiation. (Chavez et al., 2015; Gilbert et al., 2013) Gene expression during embryological chondrogenesis is well understood, and the limitations of MSC-chondrogenesis in vitro are also well documented. Our strategy is to apply this understanding to modulate gene expression in MSC-chondrogenesis. Our aim is to genetically engineer MSC-chondrogenesis to advance articular chondrocyte phenotype and enhance cartilage extracellular matrix expression and analyse the physiological, structural and mechanical properties of the cartilage produced. Finally our optimised engineered cells will be tested within a ceramic-polymer composite to mimic the endogenous tissue and enhance survival and phenotype. (Vukajlovic et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2017) The purpose of this research is to aid and enhance the biological treatment options of patients with cartilage defects and osteoarthritis. This may lead to translational research testing the optimum engineered MSC-chondrocytes in an in vivo rat cartilage-defect model.	The Dunhill Medical Trust	Research Training Fellowships	194520.4	GBP

ALDH7A1 deficiency is a paradigm of how our limited understanding of underlying pathomechanisms leaves many patients with suboptimal clinical outcome. Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE) has been known since 1954 but only within the last decade its molecular background has been elucidated. The majority of PDE cases is caused by a block in lysine degradation due to ALDH7A1 deficiency with the accumulation of metabolic intermediates that inactivate the essential cofactor vitamin B6 (pyridoxine; pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP)). It has become obvious, that irrespective of early treatment, about 75% of ALDH7A1 deficient patients suffer from intellectual disability (IQ < 70). This statistic suggests permanent neuronal damage is caused by the accumulation of metabolic intermediates associated with impaired activity of ALDH7A1. Interestingly no firm correlation has been found between genotype, accumulation of known metabolites and intellectual outcome. We hypothesize that the variation in cognitive outcome of ALDH7A1 deficiency could be caused by crucial pathomechanisms outside of the lysine catabolic pathway, which have not been identified to date.Here we propose the use of mass spectrometry-based metabolomics to investigate the comprehensive biochemical perturbations due to ALDH7A1 deficiency.Aim 1 Generation of in vitro models of ALDH7A1 deficiency enable the comparative metabolomics of ALDH7A1 deficiency under precisely controlled experimental conditions. We will develop tissue culture models in patient derived fibroblasts, in addition to using CRISPR/Cas genome editing to generate ALDH7A1 deficient astrocyte-neuronal co-cultures.Aim 2 High-resolution mass spectrometric metabolomic analysis of in vitro models and patient biofluids will be performed by a targeted metabolomic analysis of known pathways affected in ALDH7A1 deficiency; isotopic tracers in model systems will reveal the fate of essential metabolites e.g. PLP and its products. Untargeted metabolomic analysis will reveal hitherto unrecognized pathomechanisms that may be crucial to our understanding of the variability in outcome.

Certain non-coding regulatory sequences, called enhancers, bind to gene promoters and act as molecular switches to regulate gene expression during development. The recent explosion in genomics data has revealed epigenetic features that correlate with the active state of enhancers; however, little is known about the molecular events that are required to establish enhancer activity, as it has proven difficult to manipulate the ‘on’ and ‘off’ states of these sequences in vivo. To address this issue, we propose to develop a novel technology that allows for rapid and reversible silencing of transcriptional enhancers in living cells. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and small molecule chemical inducers of proximity, we will be able to modify the epigenetic state of a given enhancer, enabling us to switch target gene expression on and off. Further, because this system allows precise temporal control we will be able to define and model the biochemical sequence of events that lead to both the establishment and dissolution of enhancer-promoter choices. With the insights gained from these mechanistic studies, we can apply these observations to many pressing biological questions. We aim to repress neuronal enhancers during neural stem cell differentiation to determine their functional contribution to neural cell identity, as well as test the therapeutic potential of this approach by silencing oncogenic enhancers to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells.

The reason why some patients have a more severe manifestation of the disease in early adulthood, is unknown. While emphasis to date has been on improving diagnostic sensitivity , disease variants suggest disease association with disruption of a common molecular pathway by mutations in genes encoding desmosome proteins. Recognition and control of this genetic pathway would facilitate examination of the mechanism behind ARVC disease progression. This project therefore proposes a model to understand and modulate the genetic basis of ARVC severity using mature human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes with an ARVC gene mutation in PKP2 desmosome gene. This combines recent developments in light-responsive CRISPR dCas9 gene-modifying technologies (genome engineering) and the recent applications of light-sensitive biocompatible nanofibers (tissue engineering) in a unique approach for modulating gene responses to exaggerate severity in an ARVC mutant model that mimic patient genotype.

407	Dr Clapcote	University of Leeds	None	2019-10-01	2022-09-30	Development of an invertebrate model of alternating hemiplegia of childhood	Rationale and Timeliness: Further molecular insight of the pathways involved in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is warranted for deeper understanding of the disease and drug development efforts. My 2018 publications in European Heart Journal and Circulation Research showed HCM could be phenocopied by a set of 11 isogenic CRISPR/Cas9 variants of the MYH7 gene (beta myosin heavy chain) of human pluripotent stem cell-cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs). Twelve different phenotyping methods were used to interrogate the generated human cell lines, often showing contradictory results relative to animal models. Importantly, a cohort of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) potentially linked to HCM was identified by RNA sequencing. This collection of cell resources, underpinning technologies and putative lncRNA pathway controllers form the basis of this proposal. Hypothesis and plans: I hypothesise that unveiling the function of these novel lncRNAs will provide new mechanisms and drug targets for HCM. To test this hypothesis, I propose to modulate the expression of these lncRNAs in hPSC-CMs by harnessing the dead Cas9 technology. I will then assess the phenotype of up/down-regulating these lncRNAs in the context of HCM, by employing the methodologies previously developed (molecular and functional assays). This will enable determining the role of lncRNAs in HCM - either as disease-causing or cardioprotective per se, or as gene modifiers regulating the primary disease effects caused by the structural defect. Finally, prediction and validation of lncRNA-interacting proteins by coupling in silico tools with molecular biology methods will result in the identification of new pathways involved in HCM, shedding light into the development of future drug treatments. If replacement of 50% of animals for HCM research could be achieved by further validating the human model, this will equate to sparing of 2100-5000 animals (of all species) in severe procedures in the next 10 years.

Summary: The cardiac sarcomere is a multi-protein complex essential to cardiac contractile function. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) are caused by pathogenic variants (PV) in sarcomere protein genes. Variants in genes directly involved in cellular contractility MYH7 (&beta;-myosin heavy chain), MYH6 (&alpha;-myosin heavy chain), and MYBPC3 (Myosin binding protein C) are either known or hypothesised to cause disease. Previous analyses of the mechanisms by which variants cause disease have relied on rodent models and extrapolation from clinical data. The introduction of clinically defined mutations into human iPSC-CMs using CRISPR/Cas-9 would allow the interrogation of these cellular phenotypes in a human background using molecular and mechanical strategies, adding clarity to the uncertainties of variant-phenotype relationships in these genes. Key goals: i) Interrogation of the molecular and biophysical (contraction and relaxation) mechanisms by which PVs in MYH7, MYH6, and MYBPC3 cause either HCM or DCM. ii) Define the contractile mechanism of MYH6 and MYH7 PVs to establish if they mirror one another. iii) Investigate if high throughput functional analyses of iPSC-CMs can be used to test individual variants of unknown clinical significance (VUS) to discriminate between those that are disease causing versus ‘benign’.

This project will determine the structural properties and drug-binding potential of two regions of the viral RNA essential for invasion and propagation of the COVID-19 genome in host cells: genes responsible for making spike and fusion proteins. Specifically, the project will develop new and efficient graph-theory based computational algorithms for identifying subregions in the COVID-19 viral genome that alter the RNA substructure when they are mutated. Identification of these subregions will aid in the discovery of anti-viral inhibitor compounds. Graph theory tools already developed in the PI?s lab offer coarse-grained approaches for RNA structural analysis and design. The PI will combine these tools with biomolecular modeling to examine the therapeutic potential of anti-viral inhibitors known from SARS, MERS, and other viruses. This project will produce structural insights into the RNA viral regions and identify critical nucleotides and candidate inhibitors that will help make progress against COVID-19. The research has profound impact to COVID-19 as well as other coronaviruses that could emerge in the future. The project offers unique interdisciplinary training in mathematics, biology, chemistry, and scientific computing for young scientists, including women and minorities. The research results will be shared rapidly with the COVID-19 research community at large.<br/><br/>RNA-targeting approaches have therapeutic potential due to the high sequence and structure conservation of the viral genomes and the rapid emergence of CRISPR technology. They also present alternatives when protein-inhibiting compounds lead to invasion of the RNA viral genome itself. Such compounds that alter the RNA structure significantly are expected to inhibit viral invasion and replication. Because the fusion-protein coding region contains a pseudoknot (intertwined base-pair) substructure involved in a frame-shifting mechanism, the determination of critical mutation regions and associated compounds that destroy this pseudoknot will be invaluable. The project team has rich experience in biomolecular modeling and simulation of nucleic acid complexes and has developed a graph-theory framework for analyzing RNA motifs, predicting structures, and designing novel RNA folds. The graph-theory framework will be extended and applied in this project to address the COVID-19 pandemic by determining key regions in the RNA COVID-19 viral genome and associated chemical inhibitors that would interfere with viral fusion into and replication within host cells. With this award, the Mathematical Biology Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry are funding Dr. Schlick from New York University to determine the structural properties and drug-binding potential of the COVID-19 viral RNA.<br/><br/>This grant is being awarded using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Parasitic nematode-NTDs inflict devastating disease on >1 billion of the world’s poorest people, promoting destitution, and diminishing the health and socio-economic status of ODA countries. Increasing risk of drug resistance, and shortfalls in available chemotherapies/treatment options for some parasites, magnify the urgent need for new drugs. New, robust chemotherapy pipelines are required for the sustainability of nematode-NTD control. Novel drug target discovery in parasitic nematodes (PNs) relies on the development of advanced functional genomics tools, however this has been hindered by PN genetic intractability. At present the human pathogen Stronglyloides stercoralis is the only PN amenable to genome-editing techniques. This study will exploit S. stercoralis CRISPR/Cas9, the most advanced PN functional genomics platform, as a translational model for parasite biology and novel drug target candidacy. GPCRs control many important aspects of PN biology but remain chemotherapeutically unexploited. Their pharmacological appeal is underscored by mammalian GPCR-druggability and the unlikely potential for inherent cross-resistance. This work will employ in silico tools and localisation techniques to identify novel GPCR-targets for functional validation. Endocannabinoid-GPCRs modulate core biological processes and are appealing PN drug targets. Nematode-EC signaling knowledge is limited to Caenorhabditis elegans, however preliminary data reveal EC-GPCR conservation and functional importance in key PN-NTD pathogens. Initially, in a proof-of-concept approach, endocannabinoid (EC) GPCR-targets will be identified, prioritised and validated using the S. stercoralis genome-editing platform.

411	Dr Michael Flower	University College London	None	2020-03-01	2022-02-28	The DNA damage response in Huntington’s disease	This grant aims to elucidate how DNA maintenance pathways influence the stability of DNA repeat tracts, and harness this knowledge to therapeutically modulate the DNA damage response (DDR) in HD and other repeat expansion diseases. In HD, somatic expansion of the CAG repeat is a key driver of disease course. Recent genetic studies have identified DNA maintenance genes, particularly those involved in mismatch repair (MMR), as modifiers of onset and progression in repeat expansion diseases. DNA repeat tracts form abnormal secondary structures, which are substrates for MMR, and the resulting strand slippage likely introduces expansions. We have shown FAN1 protects against, and MSH3 is required for, repeat instability. We developed cell models, including iPSC-derived MSNs, that recapitulate the expansion rate and repeat length dependence observed in human striatum. We will knockout MSH3, and introduce modifier variants, investigating for effects on DNA repair activity, protein interactions and repeat instability. Using patient-derived lymphoblasts from the TRACK-HD study, we will determine whether the MSH3 modifier variant influences the repair activity and repeat instability. We will investigate the therapeutic potential of ASO-mediated MSH3 knockdown. The role of DNA damage, abnormal secondary structures and DNA replication in somatic instability will be studied in HD and other repeat disease IPSC cell lines. We will identify novel modifiers of repeat instability through a CRISPR screen, and compliment this with an shRNA screen of DDR network components in our cell models. Modulation of DNA maintenance has great therapeutic potential in HD and other repeat expansion disorders.	The Academy of Medical Sciences	None	30000.0	GBP
412	Professor Vincent Dion	CARDIFF UNIVERSITY	None	2020-01-01	2023-01-01	AMS Professorship Award for Professor Vincent Dion, Cardiff University	There is currently no disease modifying treatment for any of the expanded CAG/CTG repeat disorders. Our goal is to remedy this. We identified two attractive single use therapeutic options to treat these disorders. One is to contract the repeat tract, the other is to silence the expression of the expanded allele. Current approaches using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are working their way to the clinic; CRISPR-based ones are not far behind. Unfortunately, such treatments target both the mutant and normal alleles. Indeed, in 13 of the 14 expanded CAG/CTG repeat disorders, patients are heterozygotes. The normal allele often performs important functions and it should remain untouched. Moreover, the ASO-based approaches must be administered continually throughout the individual’s lifetime, creating a significant burden on their quality of life. We have recently shown that gene editing can be allele-length specific by using the CRISPR-Cas9 nickase. Such a treatment would correct the cause of these diseases permanently. Here, we aim to identify novel factors that can be harnessed to silence expanded CAG/CTG repeats specifically, independently of disease locus. We will thereby open the way for new therapeutic options for all expanded CAG/CTG diseases. We will use a variety of novel high throughput screening approaches in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from patients. We will collaborate with the Medicine Discovery Institute at Cardiff University, which develops drugs against cancer and neurological diseases. Our CRISPR-based approach is highly promising, and the next step is to establish that the frequency of off target mutations is low enough to move into the clinic. This is a challenging issue since the current methods for measuring CRISPR-mediated off-targets are suitable neither for detecting nicks nor for monitoring changes in repeat size. Here we aim to use Huntington disease as a model system to develop a new method of identifying off target mutations using single-cell sequencing. For all projects running in my lab, a major challenge is to obtain bespoke bioinformatics support. Arguably, the best way of doing so is to embed a computational biologist into my research group. This will allow lab members to exchange ideas, leading to better experimental design and more efficient analysis methods. The AMS professorship supporting such a post would provide a major boost to every project in my lab. Furthermore, I could support a postdoc for two years with the aim to obtain a postdoctoral fellowship and become successful in his/her own rights. This is a critical time for me as I establish my lab in a new country. My approach to this is two fold. First, I plan to acquire competitive funding. Second, I aim to grow a national network. The AMS professorship would be especially helpful for both of these goals. The funding it provides would give me time to gather preliminary data and successfully obtain funding from major funders, including the MRC and the Wellcome Trust. In addition, the AMS career development events would help me tremendously towards building a new network of collaborators.

413	Professor Ulrich Rass	University of Sussex	None	2020-01-01	2023-07-31	AMS Professorship Award for Professor Ulrich Rass, University of Sussex	After a PhD at the University of Cologne and postdoctoral work at Clare Hall with Steve West (CRUK) on mechanisms of DNA break repair and links to premature ageing, neurodegeneration, and cancer, I have set up my own research programme as Junior Group Leader at the Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research (FMI) in Basel. Following my recent move to the Genome Damage and Stability Centre, I am looking to establish research lines in chromosome maintenance and replication in the UK. This is supported by University of Sussex start-up funding, ensuring continuity of ongoing basic research projects. Funding from the AMS Professorship Scheme would provide the opportunity to bridge the gap between basic and translational research, allowing me to pursue a two-pronged approach to understand the cellular responses to replication stress on a molecular level, and test whether the enzymes involved can be suitable anti-cancer targets. Inherent replication stress sensitizes cancer cells to interference with DNA repair and replication fork maintenance, providing a potential point of therapeutic intervention. Our discovery of the Dna2-Yen1 axis has provided a handle on the ill-defined processes occurring at perturbed replication forks. We will explore the molecular space surrounding Dna2-Yen1/GEN1 using molecular genetics, analyses of DNA structures and replication intermediates, and by investigating downstream events re-establishing chromosome integrity following nucleolytic sister-chromatid separation in mitosis. We have already identified additional activities of the Dna2-Yen1 pathway, suggesting active processing of the leading and lagging strands, consistent with extensive replication fork remodelling. These insights have inspired my aspiration to move into translational studies using a pathophysiologically-relevant MCF10A-based HER2-DELTA-dirven breast cancer model. HER2-DELTA cells grow in 2D, as 3D organoids, and give rise to tumours in mice. Our unpublished results show significant attenuation of cancer-cell growth upon CRISPR-Cas9-mediated DNA2 point mutations (abrogating its nuclease or helicase activities) or knock-out of the MUS81 nuclease (which shares functions with GEN1). Excitingly, MUS81 and DNA2 mutations abolished tumour-uptake in mice (with Prof. Bentires-Alj, University-Hospital Basel), which is consistent with the hypothesis that cancer cells develop a non-oncogenic addiction to key effectors of the replication stress response and promising for therapeutic exploitation. We want to build on these results, harnessing mechanistic insight into DNA metabolism in the search for effective cancer treatments, which remains a major health issue. Mechanistically, we will establish the mechanisms of cell death upon DNA2-GEN1 and MUS81 abrogation in cancer cells. Translationally, our primary goal is to provide proof-of-principle that effector-level inhibition of the replication stress response will be a feasible anti-cancer strategy in future. Support by the Academy of Medical Sciences Professorship Scheme will be critical to implement this translational arm of our research in the UK and to pursue our ambitious strategy of marrying research into fundamental chromosome maintenance processes with direct assessment of novel insight for impact in disease settings. Since replication stress is widespread in cancers, exploiting replication stress for targeted therapy is not tied to a particular cancer type, giving our findings far-reaching relevance.

As investigations of how DNA variation and mutation contributes to disease advance, demand for GA mouse models increases. Recently, this demand has been aided by the new CRISPR/Cas9 technology, an RNA guided nuclease system, which permits the production of models at unprecedented efficiencies. Already the biomedical community is applying this new technology widely for mouse model production. Meanwhile, the 3Rs impact of the technology remains unexplored. This proposal seeks to address aspects of the technology that, our experience shows, can lead to substantial increases in mouse usage and wasted production of undesirable genotypes. Following CRISPR/Cas9 microinjection into mouse zygotes, the founders generated are invariably mosaic, due to the persistence of the nuclease after the first cleavage event. Founders must be bred extensively to ensure transmission of the desired allele, increasing mouse usage. The mosaicism also precludes the phenotyping of the founder generation, which, given the high efficiencies of CRISPR/Cas9 might be feasible for certain phenotypic screens. We plan to explore whether the use of Cas9 fusions with destabilizing or cell-cycle regulatory domains can be used to confine nuclease activity to the 1-cell stage and thus eliminate mosaicism. Furthermore, the mode of Cas9 supply, protein or maternally contributed via transgenic Cas9 overexpression will be investigated for its impact on mosaicism. As a potential refinement, methods to address and limit deleterious indel mutagenesis during knock-in mice production, a class of model particularly sought after for interrogating disease-related mutation, will be investigated. Whether the mode of nuclease delivery, the use of cell cycle-regulated Cas9 and co-injection of wild-type repair templates can impact the rate of indel mutation at the non-targeted allele will be assessed.

Currently, treatment options are very limited, and early educational intervention is the cornerstone for the management of cognitive impairment in most ND, indicating the positive effect of early actions during brain development. Among ND, Down syndrome (DS) is caused by the presence of an extra chromosome 21, and it represents the leading cause of genetically-defined intellectual disability. Different pharmacological treatments targeting one of the many pathways downstream of the triplicated genes have been shown to rescue cognitive impairment in DS animal models. Nevertheless, most of these preclinical studies have been performed postnatally and often in adults, possibly because of concerns of unwanted drug side effects that may have long-lasting noxious sequelae on a developing brain at embryonic stages. On the other hand, viral (but also non-viral) gene therapy approaches in animal models of ND have been mostly neglected because of technical and ethical issues, when considered in the light of future translational applications. Yet, DS is mostly diagnosed prenatally, when many of its brain developmental abnormalities originate. Here, we will investigate whether in utero manipulation of specific and possibly converging gene networks in neuronal progenitors of DS mice by CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology, may recover brain development and cognitive deficits later in life. Specifically targeting neuronal progenitors will allow us to act at early stages of brain development, while avoiding the involvement of genetic editing of germline cells and all related ethical issues. In parallel, we will also develop safer (viral-free) technological approaches for genetic manipulations in utero to minimize technical issues in the view of potential future translational applications.

416	Felix K. Niggli	University of Zurich	Abteilung für Onkologie Kinderspital Zürich Universitäts-Kinderklinik	2017-01-01	2019-12-31	Pathogenesis of Ewing Sarcoma	Although optimization of classical treatment regimens led to advances in survival of cancer patients, this approach now reached a plateau and there is no significant progress for patients presenting with metastasis since years. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify and develop further alternative targeted treatment strategies to improve therapy as well as minimize treatment related side effects. As about one third of the known cellular oncogenes are transcription factors (TFs), these represent highly interesting targets for potential therapeutic interventions, however remain challenging to directly inhibit by small molecules. In our experiments, we use the pediatric tumor Ewing sarcoma (ES) as a model system. This sarcoma is characterized by expression of the tumor-specific chimaeric TF EWS/FLI1 in the majority of cases. Survival of ES cells is dependent on continuous expression of the fusion protein in vitro as well as in vivo. Therefore, this TF represents an ideal and attractive therapeutic target and consequently we hypothesize here that targeting of EWS/FLI1 needs a deeper understanding of the biology of this fusion protein and its downstream targets. We propose on the one hand to identify and rank the physiological importance of activated downstream targets directly in vivo and on the other to characterize the fusion protein on the biochemical level to identify additional mechanisms for therapeutic intervention and tackle some of the urgent open questions in the field. Specifically, we will address the following research aims:1. To characterize the biochemistry of the fusion protein. Much attention has been devoted to study transcriptional mechanisms and target genes. In contrast, not much is known about specific post-translational mechanisms regulating the activity of the fusion protein. After having identified the majority of post-translational modifications of EWS/FLI1, we will study the physiological role of these modifications and identify upstream enzymes. Based on our previous studies, we will further characterize the regulatory mechanisms responsible for fusion protein turnover.2. To identify oncogenic key factors (drivers) from EWS/FLI1 activated target genes. Most of the studies available today characterize the function of individual target genes. However, it is not likely that all EWS/FLI1 activated genes act as oncogenic drivers in vivo. Hence, we propose to screen for crucial oncogenic drivers directly in vivo using an inducible shRNA library to identify and rank the most important therapeutic targets, also in the context of synthetic lethality with standard treatment. 3. To characterize early tumorigenic events by developing a novel ES tumor model based on reprogramming of engineered fibroblast. Because of lack of a suitable tumor model, early events leading to ES cannot be studied. We hypothesize that reprogramming of human fibroblasts to iPS cells and subsequent teratoma formation offers such a model system. We will model the EWS/FLI1 translocation in human fibroblasts using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique and subsequently reprogram these cells with the known Yamanaka factors. Pediatric sarcomas represent rare tumor types with still unacceptable low cure rates. Novel data characterizing the genomic landscape of ES tumors revealed that they show few recurrent additional genetic alterations apart from the fusion protein. Therefore, we focus our efforts on the biology of the fusion protein itself or important downstream target genes that represent actionable targets. The proposed experiments are expected to shed novel light on the biology of Ewing sarcoma, the regulation of EWS/FLI1 activity and thereby facilitate the development of urgently needed novel therapeutic strategies.

Disruption of this equilibrium leading to abnormal mitochondrial turnover has been associated with diverse pathologies, including cancer, Parkinson’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Using a cell-based assay with controlled Parkin expression, I plan to identify novel essential players involved in Parkin-mediated clearance of mitochondria and/or in mitochondrial biogenesis. For this I will use the CRISPR/Cas-9 technology to screen the entire human genome for such proteins. Subsequent identification of target genes will be followed by functional characterisation of selected hits. The proposed project will lead to the discovery of new mechanisms governing mitochondrial homeostasis in mammalian cells, and may provide novel targets for biomedical intervention in diseases associated with impaired mitochondrial function.

The structure of this map affects evolutionary dynamics and has important consequences for the predictability of evolution, speciation, and the evolution of mutational robustness, genetic recombination, and evolvability. Establishing the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes or fitness is not just a basic pursuit, but also one that has highly important practical implications in medicine and biotechnology, where we need to accurately predict the fitness effects (positive and negative) of human mutations or engineered genome modifications. However, at present, our knowledge of this relationship in practically all living systems is very poor. Having worked during my PhD on a genotype-phenotype map using computational approaches, in this project I intend to leverage recent advances in DNA synthesis, high-throughput sequencing, and DNA barcoding to go a step further and approach this question experimentally in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. My goal is to study how the fitness effects of mutations in important biological modules of a cell change with the environment and the genetic background. Specifically, I will study the signal transduction Ras/PKA and TOR/Sch9 pathways, which are commonly mutated during laboratory evolution experiments, and control cell growth in response to many different nutrients. Mammalian homologs to many genes in these pathways are oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, and are very commonly mutated in human malignancies. I plan to address my goal by undertaking two specific aims:1. Mutational scanning of two major signaling pathways in adaptive evolution. I will map the fitness effects of >50,000 mutations in the coding regions of the Ras/PKA and TOR/Shc9 pathways. To do this, I will employ a cutting-edge CRISPR-based method that permits combined editing of multiple loci at single-nucleotide resolution on a genomic scale and high-resolution barcode-tracking of these edits in a cell population. I will analyze the distribution of fitness effects across different selective environments. As a point of comparison, I will also assay a large number of variants segregating in natural populations of S. cerevisiae and different Saccharomyces species. Many components of these pathways are targets of Hsp90, a molecular chaperone that has been proposed to modulate the genotype-fitness map. Therefore in these experiments I will also investigate the impact of Hsp90 activity (using multiple structurally distinct inhibitors such as geldanamycin and radicicol) on the fitness of the variants.2. Investigate the impact of epistasis in the evolution of these pathways. Epistasis means that the effect of a mutation depends on the genetic background in which it occurs. The extent to which epistasis shapes adaptive evolutionary trajectories has been vigorously debated. My objective here is to experimentally test epistatic interactions between pairs of adaptive mutations in the Ras/PKA and TOR/Shc9 pathways using the same CRISPR-based method. Mapping epistatic interactions between pairs of mutations in different selective environments will allow me to answer fundamental questions regarding epistasis, such as how the intensity of epistasis change as a function of the environment, or the prevalence of different types of epistasis.As this project requires an integrative approach incorporating the mechanistic perspective of systems biology into an evolutionary framework, I propose to carry it out jointly in the laboratories of Prof. Daniel F. Jarosz (systems biology) and Prof. Dmitri A. Petrov (evolution), both at Stanford University. The proposed project constitutes a major step forward toward the acquisition of the technical competencies to become an independent researcher in the field of evolutionary systems biology. At the same time this research plan represents an innovative approach to studying a problem that goes beyond this basic field and has broad implications for human disease and genome engineering alike.

There is accumulating evidence that genomic non-coding, distant-acting regulatory modules contribute significantly to human disease. However, links to mechanistic processes are very difficult to establish, since a significant proportion of the gene regulatory sequences located in the 98% non-coding portion of the human genome remains unannotated. Enhancers are the major cis-regulatory modules directing tissue- and cell type-specific gene expression and therefore essential for organ formation and morphogenesis. Although next-generation sequencing approaches have uncovered genome-wide enhancer signatures in human and mouse developing hearts, the enhancer and transcript profiles underlying distinct cardiac cell types have remained elusive. Therefore, I am harnessing a new method termed INTACT in combination with next-generation sequencing based technologies to identify the genome-wide epigenomic and transcriptome signatures present in cardiac cell types and subregional cell populations. Correlation of these profiles will allow the discovery of shared and unique regulatory programs and has the potential to identify novel cardiac subtypes. I will use large-scale transgenesis as a gold-standard method to expand the catalogue of subregional heart enhancers and leverage a high-throughput CRISPR/Cas9 injection pipeline to study the function of cell type-specific cardiac enhancers in vivo.

A detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing load-regulated bone remodeling could therefore lead to the identification of molecular targets for the development of novel therapies. Bone remodeling is a multiscale process mediated through complex interactions between multiple cell types and their local 3D environments. However, the underlying mechanisms of how cells respond to mechanical signals are still unclear. By combining single-cell “omics” technologies with well-established tissue-scale models of bone mechanobiology, MechAGE proposes to develop the technology required to allow spatially resolved in vivo single-cell mechanomics of bone adaptation and regeneration. CRISPR/Cas technology will be exploited to generate fluorescent reporter mice to identify the different cell types involved in the bone remodeling process. By combining RNA-sequencing of single cells isolated by laser-capture microdissection with micro-finite element analysis and time-lapsed in vivo micro-CT, MechAGE will link the transcriptome of hundreds of single cells to their local mechanical in vivo environment (LivE). This will allow investigation of molecular responses of the cells to LivE changes with aging in established mouse models of bone adaptation and regeneration. In addition to in vivo mechanomics, MechAGE proposes to use cellular and multiscale computational modeling to run in silico simulations of real-world events for better understanding of diseases of aging in mice and to maximize the use of the high quality in vivo mechanomic data. Findings from MechAGE will lead to a systems level understanding of the spatio-temporal regulation of gene expression during the process of load-induced bone adaptation and regeneration in the aging mouse.

First, chlorophyll is converted to a primary fluorescent chlorophyll catabolite (pFCC) with PHEOPHORBIDE A OXYGENASE (PAO) as the key enzyme. In the second part, pFCC is modified by different enzymes to ultimately produce a species-specific variety of final chlorophyll degradation products, so-called phyllobilins, which accumulate in the vacuole of senescent cells. Phyllobilins have been identified from more than twenty angiosperm species, mostly in senescent leaves. Accordingly, it has been considered that the PAO/phyllobilin pathway is highly conserved within higher plants. Even though almost all enzymatic steps of the first part of the PAO/phyllobilin pathway have been elucidated in the past, there are open questions regarding (i) the conservation of the pathway in different tissues within a given species, (ii) the degree of pathway diversity among different angiosperm species, including the molecular identity of several phyllobilin-modifying enzymes, and (iii) the evolutionary origin and phylogenetic distribution and diversity of the enzymes of the pathway. This proposal aims to address some of these aspects by answering the following questions:- How can tissue-specific differences in phyllobilin formation be explained?- How diverse is the occurrence of phyllobilins within photosynthetic organisms?- How widely distributed and how similar are the enzymes that catalyze PAO/phyllobilin pathway reactions?- What is the molecular identity of so far unknown activities within the pathway?To answer these questions, a variety of molecular, biochemical and analytical methods will be used. These include (i) analysis of enzyme activities, (ii) classical protein purification, (iii) production of transgenic plants by classical T-DNA- and CRISPR/Cas9-based methods and their analysis, (iv) phyllobilin analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, (v) genome-wide association studies and (vi) bioinformatics- and proteomics-based identification of candidate proteins.Breakdown of chlorophyll is a physiological process that has a broad impact for daily life; among other aspects it is relevant for the food industry, for example the shelf life of leafy vegetables and fruits, and for the amenity sector, for example turf grass systems. With this in mind, it seems surprising that the mechanism of chlorophyll breakdown so far mainly focused on a few angiosperm model species. This proposal aims to get a better picture about the extent of existence and variability of the PAO/phyllobilin pathway within the lineage of oxygenic photosynthetic organisms and about its evolutionary origin.

While hypothermia slows global protein synthesis and cell metabolism, a small subset of proteins, including the RNA-binding protein RBM3, escapes translational repression. We recently discovered that RBM3 protects cells from ER stress induced apoptosis by a molecular mechanism involving nuclear factor NF90 and the PERK-eIF2a-CHOP pathway. Preliminary data point towards a role of RBM3 in neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) self-renewal, interaction with insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF2) signaling, and that hypoxia ischemia (HI) suppresses RBM3 expression in vivo. Working hypotheses: 1) RBM3 plays a role in pluripotency, cell cycle progression, and lineage-specific differentiation of NSPCs.2) Integrity of the neurogenic niche and recovery after brain injury involves RBM3. 3) Therapeutic hypothermia after HI restores RBM3 expression and thus mediates neuroprotection. Specific aims, objectives: 1) to study the potential role of RBM3 in the regulation of NSPCs self-renewal, in HI vulnerability, and in IGF2 signaling in vitro2) to characterize the neurogenic niche in healthy and HI stressed RBM3 knock-out (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice with specific markers of ER stress response and IGF2 signaling3) to investigate RBM3 and RBM3 targets in therapeutic hypothermia after HI in vivoExperimental methods: In vitro model of NSPC self-renewal, lineage-specific differentiation; in vitro NSPC model for oxygen-glucose-deprivation (OGD), ER stress, and cold rescue. In vivo rescue model with intra-arterial transplantation of NSPCs after stroke. NSPCs are prepared from rodents, including RBM3 KO and WT mice. Rodent model of HI, including RBM3 KO and WT mice, with and without hypothermia treatment. Organotypic hippocampal slice culture. Basic research methods, including immunostaining, Western blot, Co-IP, proximity ligation assay, and real-time RT-PCR of RBM3, ER stress induced signaling, IGF2 signaling, apoptotic and neuronal markers; apoptosis and proliferation assays. siRNA and CRISPR/Cas9 system for target gene specific gene silencing, knock-in mice. Expected value of project: Enhancing the understanding of RBM3 signaling and elucidating the role of RBM3 in neural cell development and repair in vitro and in vivo will provide new insights in the molecular mechanisms underlying therapeutic hypothermia.

Longer repeat tracts in the germlines cause more severe phenotypes in the offspring of patients, whereas the bias towards repeat expansion in somatic tissues is thought to accelerate the progression of these diseases. Thus, uncovering the molecular mechanisms of CAG repeat expansion will help our understanding of the cause of expanded CAG/CTG repeat diseases. Moreover, contracting the repeat tract would remove the underlying cause of the disease and potentially provide a much needed therapeutic avenue. The goal of this grant, therefore, is to better understand CAG/CTG repeat instability such that we can eventually manipulate it. We focus on the role of local chromatin structure and folding in the instability process. We will also pursue a CRISPR-Cas9-based method that we have recently developed that specifically induces repeat contraction. We will profit from our expertise in culture cell lines, molecular genetics, and genome editing to move into disease models, in particular using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Specifically we will ask:1) Does HDAC5 induce expansions in patient-derived iPSCs and worsen the cellular phenotypes?2) Does chromatin folding at expanded CAG repeats contribute to repeat instability?3) Can the Cas9 nickase reverse cellular and behavioral phenotypes in disease models?

Transcriptional control during embryogenesis is extremely dynamic and recent evidence indicates that often several enhancers participate in driving gene expression in a tissue-specific manner. An ideal experimental model to approach these questions is the mouse embryonic limb, as the genetic mechanisms controlling its morphogenesis are well known. In particular, my PhD studies are focused on the study of the transcriptional regulation of Ptch1, which encodes the main receptor of the SHH ligand during limb development. The SHH pathway is essential for morphogenesis of diverse embryonic tissues, including the limb, and its deregulation contributes to tumorigenesis and human congenital malformations. During the period funded by the Doc.Mobility fellowship, I propose to approach two different aspects concerning Ptch1 regulation: (1) I will define the regulatory robustness of the mechanisms controlling Ptch1 expression in the mouse limb bud by using a loss-of-function strategy that takes advantage of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology; (2) I will address the mechanisms by which mouse limb bud cells are able to detect graded SHH signaling and elaborate a transcriptional response accordingly. To do so, I will use a transgenic reporter setup in which the affinity of the transcription factor motifs within a SHH-responding enhancer can be altered and the functional consequences evaluated in a straightforward manner. In summary, the research proposed here will advance our understanding on how the SHH pathway, with essential functions in development and disease, is regulated and interpreted at the transcriptional level.

Mycobacterium abscessus is a multidrug-resistant organism, which has recently emerged as a major threat to patients with cystic fibrosis. In these individuals it causes accelerated inflammatory lung damage, is often impossible to treat (with 60-70% treatment failures despite years of combination chemotherapy), and precludes lung transplantation in many US and European centres. The biology of this organism is poorly understood, in particular nothing is known about the genetic determinants of virulence, immune evasion and antibiotic resistance. My plan is to identify genes that impact on intracellular survival, a process our previous work implicated as a key step in M. abscessus pathophysiology. I will employ two orthogonal approaches. The first of these will be to use bacterial GWAS to compare existing whole genome sequencing data with multidimensional in vitro phenotyping. Secondly I plan to utilise a CRISPR-dCas9 knockdown system to generate a high complexity pooled mutant library of M. abscessus, which I can then use for forward genetic functional screening. By comparing input and output pools (using Illumina sequencing), I will be able to identify critical genes potentially responsible for intracellular survival. I plan to prioritise these based on novelty, effect size and whether they are identified by both screens. I will then select several hits to validate further, initially by generating knockout bacteria, complementing with wildtype or polymorphic variant genes, and then evaluating their behaviour in macrophage infection experiments.

In humans, IAV infection can result in mild to severe to lethal disease, depending on the IAV strain. The factors which govern the varied outcome of IAV infection are poorly understood. The aim of our study is to understand the mechanisms which regulate the severity of IAV infections, by using modern genetic tools. It will eventually help us devise better strategies for prevention and control of IAV infections.	DBT/Wellcome Trust India Alliance	Intermediate Fellowship	3.52671E+7	INR

These proliferation-quiescence decisions are poorly understood in mammalian cells, yet getting these decisions right is vital for normal development and tissue homeostasis. Dysregulation of proliferation-quiescence decisions underpins uncontrolled proliferation in tumorigenesis. If we can understand how signalling networks regulating proliferation and quiescence are controlled, then we can design strategies to specifically inhibit cancer cell proliferation or to improve tissue regeneration and improve human health. We have a number of objectives to achieve our aim. First, we will define the mechanisms that maintain reversibility in quiescence. Second, we will characterise how cell intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence CDK activity in proliferation-quiescence decisions. Finally, we will determine how cancer-specific alterations perturb signalling networks controlling cell cycle entry to drive the continuous proliferation of cells. To achieve our objectives, we will use our expertise in quantitative, single-cell, time-lapse imaging of human cell lines that we have engineered to express fluorescently-labelled proteins or biosensors. This strategy allows us to simultaneously measure cell cycle entry and the regulatory signalling events in real-time in the same cell. By generating and integrating proteomic and phosphoproteomic datasets with our imaging data, we will work towards a systems-level understanding of proliferation-quiescence decisions in mammalian cells. We will also use our imaging data to parametrise new mathematical models to achieve a mechanistic understanding of the control of proliferation-quiescence decisions. These models will be tested experimentally using genetic (siRNA, CRISPR knockouts, degron tags) and chemical (small molecule inhibitors) perturbations to test the predictive value of our models.

These are mainly nonsense mutations leading to SCN1A haploinsufficiency. Dravet syndrome is resistant to anti-epileptic medication, and sodium channel targeting drugs may even worsen it, probably because inhibitory neurons do not tolerate SCN1A haploinsufficiency as well as principal neurons. At the moment gene therapy is not realistic because the gene is too big for Adeno-Associated viral vectors that have been used in clinical trials for widespread CNS transduction. We aim to find a general approach to rescue haploinsufficient mutations in SCN1A. We will increase the activity of the endogenous SCN1A promoter by inserting enhancing elements with CRISPR/Cas9. Using this strategy, our goal is to increase the transcription of both the wild type and the mutant alleles, thus restoring Nav1.1 expression to a normal level. We will test several possible enhancing modules in an animal model of Dravet Syndrome at different developmental stages, examining their efficiency in suppressing spontaneous and febrile seizures, and correcting behavioural deficits such as social interactions. This proposal will be useful not only to understand if and when we can permanently rescue Dravet syndrome, but will yield proof of principle of a generalizable method for treating other CNS diseases arising from haploinsufficiency. We think this approach will help to take gene editing closer to clinical translation for neurological diseases. Moreover, it will have an impact for basic neuroscience because, for the first time, we will be able to study the consequences of modifying endogenous promoters in vivo.

The cells of the blastocyst are capable of generating all adult cell types, a phenomenon known as pluripotency. The inner cell mass (ICM) of the blastocyst can moreover be cultured in a dish as pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs). ESCs have become invaluable tools in regenerative medicine and to study development itself. With 1 in 8 couples experiencing infertility in the UK, it is ever more important to understand the factors contributing to healthy embryo development. Transposable elements (TEs) are parts of our DNA that are currently or historically mobile, -i.e. having the capacity to 'paste' themselves into new places in the genome. Many TE sequences used to be thought of as simply 'junk DNA'; however, we are beginning to understand that TEs have evolved to play new and unexpected roles in development and disease. For example, uncontrolled TE activity has been implicated in neurodegeneration and cancer. However, the expression of many TEs is also high in normal development, suggesting that they may also have beneficial roles in cells. This proposal focuses on exploring the function and regulation of a particular TE, called mouse endogenous retrovirus type L, MERVL. MERVL is the earliest expressed TE, and is transiently upregulated in mouse embryos at the 2-cell stage. This stage, conserved in human in 4-8 cell embryos, encompasses an essential process called Zygotic Genome Activation, when the embryo begins to turn on its own genes for the first time. These embryos are also considered "totipotent", meaning that they can not only generate embryonic tissues but also extra-embryonic tissues (like placenta). Interestingly, a small proportion of ESCs transiently become "2C-like" in normal culture, also possessing enhanced developmental potency. Here, we will use mouse ESCs and mouse embryos to investigate how and why MERVL regulation is important in early development. Using these tools, we will identify and characterize key factors required to activate and repress MERVL. In turn, we will investigate how these factors regulate the 2-cell stage, and affect ZGA and totipotency. To understand how MERVL and other TEs are directly regulated, we will combine genome-editing systems, called CRISPR/Cas9, with recent biochemical tools to pull out sets of proteins that bind MERVL. Lastly, we will explore the conservation of MERVL function and regulation in human cells, where a similar TE, HERVL, is known to play a conserved role. We aim to a) understand how HERVL regulates the 4-8 cell stage and human ZGA b) investigate how new HERVL regulators might contribute to specific cases of disease. These studies will significantly increase our understanding of how TEs contribute to early development, and will shed insight on how such processes are perturbed in disease.

430	Dr Michelle Percharde	MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences	None	2018-09-01	2021-03-31	Chromatin and Development	Our long-term goal is to understand the transcriptional and epigenetic events that underlie the process of mammalian development. In particular, we focus on the parts of the genome made up of transposable elements (TEs): elements known to be historically or currently mobile within our DNA. Significantly less is known about TEs compared to single copy protein-coding genes despite their high abundance in the human genome. This includes during mammalian development, where the role of relaxed TE repression and increased TE expression is not understood. Our previous work has revealed that the TE, LINE1 plays essential functions in controlling gene regulatory networks in the earliest stages of pre-implantation development (Percharde et al., 2018). This is interestingly independent of retrotransposition activity, and distinct from somatic cells, where increased LINE1 expression has been associated with cancer, inflammation, or senescence. These findings highlight how much is still to be learned about TE function in multiple contexts. Our objectives are firstly to investigate how TE expression and regulation has been co-opted for essential processes in mouse and human developmental contexts. Second, we aim to compare and contrast TE regulation in developmental versus disease states to understand how TE mis-regulation occurs and how this contributes to disease. We use a combination of mouse and human somatic and embryonic stem cell lines together with mouse embryo models to explore mechanisms regulating TE expression. Our experimental approach combines both candidate and genome-wide techniques, bioinformatics and CRISPR technology to uncover new TE regulators as well as to directly manipulate TE expression. Overall, we aim to shed light on how TE expression contributes to normal embryo development and uncover mechanisms to explain how and why these elements may contribute to disease.

431	Dr. Eva Maria KÖNIG	St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute	None	2019-03-15	2022-03-14	Find tumor immune evasion strategies by cellular barcoding	Immunotherapy has evolved into a pillar of cancer treatment along with therapeutic concepts such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Although most cancer immunotherapies aim at re-activating T cells, targeting natural killer (NK) cells is attracting growing attention, as NK cells are at the forefront of anti-tumor responses. However, the euphoria from recent successes stemming from the infusion of pre-activated NK cells into tumor patients is tempered by the fact that some tumor cells adapt to the constant pressure imposed by the body’s immune system. This concept of ‘immunoediting’ has been convincingly shown in experimental models of chemically induced tumors but whether and how it applies in other malignancies is still a matter of debate. We hypothesize that immunoediting takes place in natural tumors. There is unequivocal evidence for the importance of NK cells in the fight against leukemia and novel therapies using the adoptive transfer of cytokine-induced NK cells are highly successful. We thus choose leukemia as a model system to address whether NK cell-mediated immunoediting takes place. Our study design will allow two potential scenarios to be distinguished: (i) NK cells are able to kill highly immunogenic cell clones but spare pre-existing resistant sub-clones (clonal selection) or (ii) NK cells shape tumor immunogenicity by classical immunoediting. Our approach will also allow us to determine the molecular mechanisms of tumor evasion from NK cell-mediated eradication. This will be achieved by means of a cellular barcoding system that allows single leukemic cells to be tracked in vivo. The combination of cellular barcoding and next generation sequencing will enable us to determine the transcriptional changes in NK cell-resistant leukemic cell clones. Finally, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene modification will be used to identify driver mutations responsible for tumor evasion and to validate our findings. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor immune evasion is the first step towards utilizing the full potential of NK cells in anti-tumor therapy. Ultimately, the study will pave the way for new therapeutic approaches to treat tumors that have successfully evaded the immune system. The study will be supervised by the applicant Eva Maria König and the laboratory work will be performed by a PhD student at the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, supported by the applicant. Stratification of NGS data will be supported by a part time bioinformatician.	Austrian Science Fund FWF	01 Stand-Alone Projects	341760.3	EUR
432	Dr. Anne Yael NOSSENT	Medical University of Vienna	None	2019-01-01	2020-12-31	14q32 Small Nucleolar RNAs in Cardiovascular Disease	Aim. In this project, we aim to elucidate the mechanisms-of-action of 14q32 small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and explore the therapeutic potential of targeting small nucleolar RNAs in models of cardiovascular disease, as well study translational aspects of snoRNA-biology between mice and humans. Background. We have previously shown that microRNAs of the 14q32 microRNA gene cluster play a crucial role in cardiovascular physiology and pathology. We obtained a clear image of the function and mechanisms-of-action of the 14q32 microRNAs. However, the 14q32 locus also encodes four long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and 41 C/D Box snoRNAs. The mechanisms-of-action of lncRNAs are rapidly being revealed, but the function of the snoRNAs is still completely unknown. We found that genetic variations in the 14q32 snoRNA region associate with human cardiovascular disease, independent of the 14q32 microRNA or lncRNAs. Furthermore, we observed that 14q32 snoRNAs are strictly regulated during vascular remodeling, both in mouse models and in human cardiovascular disease. Hypothesis. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the 14q32 snoRNAs, like 14q32 microRNAs, play a crucial role in vascular remodelling and cardiovascular disease via non-canonical mechanisms. Through posttranscriptional regulation of their target RNAs, the 14q32 noncoding RNAs act as master switches in vascular remodelling, balancing the scale between positive and negative remodelling. Objectives. To support this hypothesis and to explore the potential of 14q32 non-coding RNAs as therapeutic targets in cardiovascular disease, we have set the following three objectives: 1. To study the molecular mechanisms-of-action of the 14q32 orphan snoRNAs. We have recently shown that all 14q32 snoRNAs preferentially bind Fibrillarin, the methyltransferase that 2’O-ribose-methylates RNA targets of C/D-box snoRNAs. However, we have also found 14q32 snoRNAs bound to Ago1 and Dicer, components of the microRNA-processor. We will create knockdown- and overexpression libraries of all 14q32 snoRNAs in human and murine (primary) cell cultures, as well snoRNA-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells using CRISPR/Cas. Using snoRNA-overexpression, followed by fibrillarin pull-down and RNA-sequencing, we will identify the snoRNAs’ target RNAs. Small RNA Sequencing will be employed to identify potential snoRNA-derived microRNAs. SnoRNA-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells will be generated and used to generate snoRNA transgenic mice, to assess the effects of snoRNA-deficiency both in vitro and in vivo. 2. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of specific inhibitors of 14q32 snoRNAs. We will use two murine models to evaluate therapeutic potential in occlusive arterial disease and post-interventional vascular remodeling: - Hindlimb Ischemia model for arteriogenesis and angiogenesis - Vein-Graft model for arterio-venous bypass failure (vein-graft disease) 3. To confirm our findings in human tissue samples from patients with cardiovascular disease. In order to safeguard clinical relevance of our findings, we will confirm changes in snoRNA expression, methylation-state, RNA-modifications and target RNA expression in human tissue samples.

In the well-studied asexual blood stages, cyclic monocistronic gene activation occurs at the transcriptional level; however, relatively few transcription factors have been identified, thus other types of regulatory processes that contribute to this coordinated gene expression are believed to exist. Through the study of molecular process of monoallelic expression of immune evasion genes in P. falciparum (project funded by a previous ERC grant to A. Scherf), we discovered an entirely new mechanism of gene silencing. We demonstrated that an exoribonuclease silences genes linked to severe malaria. A non-canonical 3’-5’exoribonuclease termed PfRNase II destroys nascent RNA made from promoter regions, leading to cryptic unstable mRNA. Parasites carrying a deficient PfRNase II produce full-length mRNA and long noncoding RNA. The molecular events and the number of genes directly controlled by this novel type of posttranscriptional gene silencing remain elusive. Aim: This proposal aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms controlling PfRNase II-dependent gene silencing using innovative strategies such as the new genome editing technique (Cas9/CRISPR) developed in my laboratory for use in P. falciparum. We will study i) the recruitment of PfRNase II to promoter regions of severe malaria related genes using protein pull-down assays and ii) the genome occupancy of PfRNase II and two other 3’-5’ exoribonucleases to determine the total number of genes controlled by this mechanism. Impact: This project represents a major change in mainstream malaria parasite gene regulation paradigms with repercussions for other organisms. The proposed research will both open new avenues in molecular process that control severe malaria and appeal to young researchers to join this rather ‘untouched’ topic.

Over a century ago, it was first observed that symbiotic species living in hosts can provide a strong barrier against infection, beyond the host’s own defence responses. We now know that ‘protective’ microbial symbiont species are key components of plant, animal, and human microbiota, shaping host health in the face of parasite infection. I have shown that microbes can evolve within days to protect, providing the possibility that microbe-mediated defences can take-over from hosts in fighting with parasites over evolutionary time. This new discovery of an evolvable microbe-mediated defence challenges our fundamental understanding of the host-parasite relationship. Here, I will use a novel nematode-microbe interaction, an experimental evolution approach, and assays of phenotypic and genomic changes (the latter using state-of-the-art sequencing and CRISPR-Cas9 technologies) to generate new insights into the drivers and consequences of coevolving protective symbioses. Specifically, the objectives are to test: (i) the ability of microbe-mediated protection to evolve more rapidly than host-encoded resistance, (ii) the impacts of evolvable protective microbes on host-parasite coevolution, and the effect of community complexity, in the form of (iii) parasite and (iv) within-host microbial heterogeneity, in shaping host-protective microbe coevolution from scratch. Together, these objectives will generate a new, synthetic understanding of how protective symbioses evolve and influence host resistance and parasite infectivity, with far-reaching implications for tackling coevolution in communities.

When developing lymphocytes reach the pre B-Cell phase they express a pre B Cell receptor and after cell surface expression it dimerises sending survival signals via Btk. Mutations of this molecule lead to the cessation of B-cell development. Patients therefore have absent B Cells and no detectable Immunoglobulins. This project will assess the CRISPR-Cas system of gene editing to correct this mutation. This involves nucleofection of cells with the Cas 9 protein complexed with a guide RNA complementary to our chosen target. This leads to a double stranded DNA break (DSB) at the Btk gene locus. Subsequently a Adeno Associated Virus 6 vector will be used to introduce a normal Btk minigene gene into the locus. Following optimisation of the technique in a Btk knockout DG75 cell line, we will trial it in CD34+ cell from healthy donors and then XLA patients. CD34+ cells will be separated from blood using Magnetic-Activated Cell Sorting. Editing efficiency will be determined by Digital Droplet PCR. Subsequently, we will perform in vitro comparisons will assess the function of gene edited patient cells. To assess for off target effects we will use GUIDE-sec (Genome-wide, unbiased identification of DSBs enabled by sequencing). This method involves tagging any DSBs in the genome with a blunt double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (dsODN). Integration points are then identified using PCR amplification and sequencing of products. We finally aim to test gene edited cells in a NSG mice model. Primary and secondary transplantation will be performed and each experiment will consist of 3 groups (negative control, gene edited group and positive control).

Building on strong pilot data that shows mutant astrocyte-dependent reduction in MN neurite length, my objectives are to: 1. Elicit whether the above phenotype is contact-mediated or due to the release of astrocyte-derived soluble factors by testing the impact of conditioned media from mutant astrocytes on MNs. 2. Elucidate underlying molecular mechanisms through a combination of unbiased transcriptomic and mass spectrometric analyses. This will be followed by manipulation of the identified molecular pathways to reverse the phenotypic deficit. Methodology - The approaches I will adopt in my programme of work are all routine in my host laboratory and include; (i) Generation of enriched human astrocyte and motor neuron cultures from 3 independent ALS patient mutant C9orf72 lines. Crucially each of these has a paired isogenic gene control generated by CRISPR/Cas9. All of these lines were derived, validated and are routinely cultured in my host lab. Using these lines, I have already generated pilot data showing mutant astrocyte-mediated reduction of MN neurite length. I will extend these findings using co-cultures and quantitative immunostaining and then use mass spectrometry and / or RNA sequencing to identify the underlying mechanism of astrocyte-mediated toxicity on MNs.

Mechanical injury to articular cartilage results in chronic inflammation, pain and predisposes to tissue damage and loss of function. There is a pressing need for disease-modifying therapies for osteoarthritis. Identifying the cellular mechanisms regulating cellular responses to injury is crucial for understanding osteoarthritis and for designing specifically-tailored therapeutic regimens. Recently, I have discovered that injury to connective tissues including articular cartilage rapidly activates the formation of Lysine 63-polyubiquitin chains that induce downstream inflammatory cascades, highlighting the critical role of ubiquitination in regulating this mechanism. Ubiquitination is a multistep reaction to add ubiquitin linkages to a protein substrate. Eukaryotic cells contain a large number of ubiquitin enzymes and the key regulators driving injury responses are currently unknown. In this fellowship, my overarching aim is to identify a new way to treat osteoarthritis by targeting the injury-induced ubiquitination machinery. My objectives are therefore: 1) to define the injury ubiquitome, 2) to identify the key ubiquitin E3 ligases driving this mechanism and 3) to investigate whether targeting the injury-induced E3 ligases in vivo can protect against development/progression of osteoarthritis. Since a large number of enzymes are involved in regulating ubiquitination, it is necessary to use a model system in which high-throughput screening is possible using readily available molecular tools. Transparent transgenic zebrafish are well suited for such studies. Using cutting edge technologies including advanced transgenesis, advanced live imaging techniques and in vivo loss-of-function screens using CRISPR/Cas9 methodologies, I will identify the key pathway regulating the injury-induced cellular responses and will determine the major E3 ligase involved as a promising therapeutic target in osteoarthritis.

438	Dr Liye Chen	University of Oxford	None	2019-04-01	2024-03-31	Identification and validation of novel T cell theraputic targets in Ankylosing Spondylitis	Background: Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) is a common form of inflammatory arthritis without a cure. Genetic association studies have revealed 113 loci affecting the risk of developing AS, most of which lack functional explanations hindering their translation to patient benefits. More than half of the genes affecting the risk of developing AS are involved in T cells functions, suggesting the important role of T cells in the pathogenesis of AS. Through integration of GWAS, eQTL and transcriptome data, combined with functional validation of gene candidates regulating T cells in AS, this proposal focuses on identification of novel T cell therapeutic targets in AS. Methods: Gene candidates regulating T cell functions in AS will be identified through the integrated analysis of AS-associated genetic variations, CD4/CD8 eQTL, transcriptome of known AS-associated T cell subsets, transcriptome of CD4/CD8 from AS patients and healthy controls and single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) of T cells from blood, joint synovial fluid/tissue from AS patients. Prioritized gene candidates will be firstly validated by gene knockdown in primary T cells from AS patients and healthy controls. The validated genes will then undergo second validation through CRISPR-knockout or gene overexpression. For 1-2 validated genes, in-depth mechanistic studies in relevant T cell subtypes will be performed. Key pathways related to validated genes will be identified through RNA-seq experiments of gene-silenced or knockout primary cells and scRNA-seq data mentioned above. Key proteins in the pathways will then be determined and validated through gene knockdown or knockout and relevant cellular assays. Potential applications: Proposed study will be the first to systematically investigate disease-associated genetic variants for the genes regulating T cell functions in AS. Data generated will provide functional explanations for AS-associated genetic loci, promote the understanding the AS pathogenesis, and potentially identify novel therapeutic targets for treatment of AS and other related arthritis.

439	Dr Daniel Bose	University of Sheffield	None	2019-06-01	2024-06-01	Dissecting the molecular basis of eRNA function.	Enhancers are regulatory non-coding DNA sequences that control cell-lineage and stimulus-specific transcription. Enhancers are transcribed into enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). eRNAs are important for regulating gene expression, but the mechanistic basis for this function remains unclear. I recently demonstrated that eRNAs can stimulate the catalytic activity of the key transcription regulator CBP to promote transcription, interactions which were widespread at enhancers across the genome. In this study, I will ask what is the mechanistic basis for eRNA function? Using multidisciplinary approaches, I will address three related but independent aims: 1) I will use biochemical assays, together with complementary techniques to probe RNA structure. Together with a mutagenesis study of eRNAs using CRISPR-Cas9 in cells, this will highlight the sequence and structural determinants of eRNA function; 2) I will map how different components of CBP regulatory complexes bind to eRNAs across the genome. Combined with methods to highlight eRNA structures bound to the complexes, this will uncover how eRNAs organise CBP complexes across the genome; 3) I will use cryo-EM to study the structure of CBP complexes bound to eRNAs, including developing new methods to facilitate these studies. In combination, these techniques will provide new insights into how eRNAs regulate gene expression.	Wellcome Trust	Sir Henry Dale Fellowship	1339467.0	GBP

The monoamine noradrenalin (norepinephrine) is a major neuromodulatory transmitter that promotes wakefulness and arousal and regulates autonomic functions. Until recently, noradrenalin signalling was considered to be specific to vertebrates. Our discovery of functional noradrenalin signalling in marine invertebrates has overturned this long-held view. In this project, we propose to investigate noradrenergic signalling in the larval stages of the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii, a laboratory animal and powerful new model for connectomics and circuit function. We will take advantage of the Platynereis system to obtain novel cellular-level insights into noradrenergic signalling through a systems-neuroscience approach. To analyse the functions of noradrenalin and its regulators at single-cell resolution, we will generate transgenic constructs and CRISPR-induced knockout lines and analyse wild-type, knockout and transgenic larvae with whole-brain activity imaging and various behavioural paradigms. We will establish whole-body wiring diagrams through serial EM reconstruction and map the components of noradrenergic signalling to the connectome. The use of this simple and accessible invertebrate genetic model will thus allow us to study noradrenergic signalling in unprecedented detail in a fully-mapped nervous system.

441	Dr Bowyer	University of Manchester	None	2020-01-01	2022-12-31	Development of an in vitro model to dissect the mechanism of fungal persistence in the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung	Cystic fibrosis is the most common fatal genetically inherited disease in Caucasian populations. This disease is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator gene (CFTR) which produces defective ion fluxes and calcium homeostasis in the epithelia. Patients with cystic fibrosis are therefore susceptible to recurrent and lethal lung infections including those caused by the fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. Animal models play a central role in the study of cystic fibrosis. Researchers have used mice, ferrets, pigs and sheep to model the inflammatory response seen in human patients with this disease. Although such models generate useful knowledge on the pathophysiology of this disease, animal models are limited for a number of reasons. One is the ethical concerns about the numbers of mice that needed to generate gene or tissue specific knock-outs which likely die early after birth. Additionally, mice, the most common vertebrate animal used, do not completely recapitulate the disease phenotypes seen in the human lung during infection and larger vertebrate such as sheep, pigs and ferrets are often used instead. The use of larger animals intrinsically have a number of limitations including housing space, high cost of the experimentations and the need to use very high number of animals to get enough statistical significance. In vitro cell culture systems using immortalised cystic fibrosis epithelial cells from donors have been developed to overcome those problems. However, genetic variability between healthy immortalised and cystic fibrosis cell lines prevents precise and statically useful comparison of events in CF and control cells which has limited them to be widely adopted by the community. Here we propose to establish a new in vitro model of isogenic cystic fibrosis and healthy controls bronchial epithelial cell lines carrying different CF mutations in the CFTR gene using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis of 16HBE bronchial cells. Using an established methodological approach developed in our laboratory including in vitro infection, confocal microscopy, expression analysis, cytokine measurements and competitive fitness analysis the student will be able to define critical stages of the interaction between the cystic fibrosis epithelia and A. fumigatus compared to healthy cells and the fungal factors governing this process. The successful completion of this project will achieve a number of scientific objectives. Firstly, the development of an isogenic cell culture system of epithelial cell lines will be of great value for researchers focused on the study of epithelia-pathogen interactions in cystic fibrosis without using any mice. Secondly, screening of A. fumigatus null libraries on CF epithelia will increase our knowledge on the pathogen factors leading persistence in the context of disease. Additionally, the student will be enrolled in a 3Rs focused programme that will give him/her the opportunity to enrol with industrial partners in Manchester and our fungal community to promote the implementation on this resource in other laboratories at an international level. As a PhD studentship we will also provide extensive training opportunities for a student, and the wider research community, on the importance of alternatives to replace animal testing.

442	Dr Charlotte Alston	The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust	None	2019-09-01	2023-08-31	Can muscle biopsy be avoided for paediatric patients with suspected mitochondrial disease?	Mitochondrial disease is an inborn error of metabolism with no cure; it affects at least 1 in 4300 births. Mitochondria produce cellular energy (ATP), and their dysfunction causes marked clinical heterogeneity, affecting any organ or tissue with energy demands e.g. brain or muscle. Symptoms can arise in adulthood or childhood but age at onset often correlates with severity; children with mitochondrial disease often have a poor prognosis and few survive into adulthood. A rapid genetic diagnosis delivers significant patient impact, facilitating clinical management and counselling for families with otherwise limited options.The diagnosis of mitochondrial disease is hindered by genetic heterogeneity; more than 1100 genes encode the mitochondrial proteome, including 280 known disease genes reported to date. The clinical and genetic heterogeneity necessitates a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis and this is delivered by the NHS-funded Highly Specialised Mitochondrial Diagnostic Service in Newcastle upon Tyne. The multidisciplinary diagnostic service is complemented by the translational research of the Wellcome Centre for Mitochondrial Research; I recently completed my NIHR-funded doctoral project across both centres. I successfully implemented a rapid targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) test (n=50 genes) that increased the genetic diagnosis rate to 50% (n=35) for a cohort of mitochondrial disease patients. Prenatal testing has already been undertaken for 13 couples as a consequence of my NIHR-funded research, demonstrating the impact of a genetic diagnosis.Our nationally-comissioned Highly Specialised mitochondrial diagnostic service receives 140 paediatric muscle biopsies annually; results from the functional analysis of muscle biopsy remains paramount for selecting appropriate candidate genes for sequencing analysis for genetic diagnosis. Muscle biopsy is invasive, expensive and requires critically ill children to undergo general anaesthetic and upon completion of the candidate gene analysis, many patients still remain without a genetic diagnosis. Our current diagnostic strategy (muscle biopsy proceeded by candidate gene sequencing) fails to genetically diagnose half of our paediatric cohort, and this needs to be addressed. This research proposal aims to do this by implementing whole exome sequencing of trios (affected patients and their parents) as a first line diagnostic genetic test, concurrently removing the requirement for muscle biopsy for these patients.Whole exome sequencing (WES) provides an unbiased strategy, whereby all candidate genes (n=1158) can be screened concurrently; through analysis of trios, phasing of variants and detection of sporadic variants becomes achievable. By using blood DNA, candidate gene selection is bypassed and removes the need for muscle biopsy.Muscle biopsy has historically been critical for functional studies, but emerging cell-based strategies such as CRISPR/Cas9 have demonstrated potential as a surrogate tissue and I propose to harness this technology to generate cellular models of patient mutations to investigate their clinical utility in the diagnostic setting. In the post-genomic era, the issue of classification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) requires increasing scientist time; development of novel systems to investigate pathogenicity will be paramount and this arm of the project seeks to future-proof our laboratory, ensuring we are prepared to cope with the VUS that emerge from our patients' NGS.

In order to extravasate into tissues, circulating leukocytes must first make rolling contacts with the vasculature before forming firm adhesions and subsequently transmigrating through the endothelium and basement membrane. These processes depend on the expression of integrins, which facilitate intercellular and cell-matrix interactions, and chemokines, which guide cell migration. Current studies are predominantly candidate-based and limited to broad neutralisation or gene deletion models, which prevents analysis of the intrinsic requirements of different cell types to infiltrate the diabetic milieu. Our approach will use genetic screening and natural genetic variants to unravel the specific molecular pathways that need to be targeted to prevent diabetogenic immune cell entry in pancreatic tissue. We will use two complementary systematic approaches to identify key pathways facilitating immune cell entry into pancreatic tissue: ProCode CrispR screening and Collaborative Cross natural variant screening. The ProcCode CrispR approach uses transfection of gRNA-lentiviruses, each with a unique protein barcode, to generate a mouse that has a mosaic population of leukocytes with representations of multiple different knockout lines. We can use this system to simultaneously screen for the functional role of all known integrins, adhesion molecules, chemokine receptors and matrix remodelling enzymes in each defined leukocyte population entering the tissues. Collaborative Cross studies compare >200 inbred mouse strains with defined parentage from eight diverse founder strains. By qualitatively and quantitatively assessing pancreatic infiltrate in these strains, we can use the predefined genetics to identify the molecular mediators down to the gene level.

Despite being one of the first molecular diseases to have its pathophysiology characterised, the management of beta-thalassaemia is far from optimal, limited to supportive therapy for the majority. We know that the unbalanced production of globin chains and subsequent excess of alpha-globin chains are the central causative factors in the pathophysiology of this condition. Currently, most attempts to ameliorate beta-thalassaemia aim to resolve globin imbalance by increasing gamma-globin production. In this project we aim to take a complementary approach; the reduction of excess alpha-globin chains, as natural reductions of alpha-globin output, in the form of co-inherited alpha-thalassaemia, ameliorate the disease phenotype in beta-thalassaemia patients. To achieve this reduction, the major regulatory element controlling alpha-globin expression will be deleted using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Proof-of-principle experiments have demonstrated the efficacy of this approach. We hope to develop the efficient editing of long term repopulating haematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) and have two complimentary aims: 1) To optimise gene-editing of the MCS-R2 enhancer by identifying the key sequences that need to be disrupted to achieve the ideal level of alpha-globin knock-down. This will be done through generating a guide-RNA library to edit various transcription factor binding sites, using a newly developed Cas9 derivative that allows for flexibility in the PAM specificities required for CRISPR/Cas9 editing. 2) To identify which sub-population of stem cells have long-term repopulating ability. Evidence suggests that the CD49f+ fraction of CD34+ cells are enriched in LT-HSCs. We will use a xenograft mouse model to evaluate whether improved editing efficiency and long-term repopulation can be achieved by editing this purified CD49f+ sub-population alone.

Among hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients with disseminated infections mortality rates as high as 80% have been reported. The efficacy of commonly used drugs to treat adenovirus infections is limited and associated with nephrotoxicity. Alternative drugs are still under investigation. Hence, given the fact that numbers of solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients are constantly rising, alternative treatment options are highly needed. CRISPR/Cas9 is a technology that allows to knock out genes with high efficiency. It can be easily adapted to target any gene of interest. Consequently, it has been demonstrated to be capable of not only knocking out cellular but also viral genes and in this way to inhibit viral replication. In this project we want to investigate if adenovirus infections, represented by human adenovirus 5 (Ad5), can be inhibited by CRISPR/Cas9 in vitro and in vivo. To inhibit Ad5 we intend to target the viral E1A gene. The delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 coding sequences will be performed with a replication-deficient adenoviral vector lacking the E1A gene. Thus, this vector will not represent a CRISPR/Cas9 target. However, it will display the same tropism as the wild-type virus and its use will thus have the advantage of delivering the CRISPR/Cas9 components into exactly those cells that are the primary targets of the wild-type virus in vivo. Moreover, the vector will be turned into a replicating vector upon encounter with the wild-type virus. Hence, we anticipate it to locally spread around sites of Ad5 infection and CRISPR/Cas9 copy numbers to increase in Ad5-infected cells due to vector amplification. We intend to assess the inhibition of Ad5 in the immunosuppressed Syrian hamster model which is able to mimic adenovirus infections in humans. Because Ad5 has a natural tropism for the liver, we will focus on this organ when investigating the inhibitory effect of CRISPR/Cas9 on virus replication in vivo. Beside investigating the inhibitory effect on wild-type Ad5 multiplication we intend to determine the kinetics of vector spread throughout the liver upon mobilization of the vector by the wild-type virus. Lastly, we intend to investigate if concomitant inhibition of the viral DNA replication machinery by other approaches such as nucleoside analog- or RNA interference-based methods can help to keep viral DNA copy numbers low and in this way to assist in viral genome inactivation by CRISPR/Cas9. The results generated in this project may possibly lay the fundament for the future development of CRISPR/Cas9-based anti-adenoviral therapeutic strategies which may improve the treatment options directed against life-threatening adenovirus infections that are refractory toward conventional therapy.

This global threat urgently calls for novel antimicrobial therapies. Adjuvant immunotherapy represents a promising strategy to combat infections without fueling drug resistance. For this to work, protective immune responses must be scaled to the level of infectious threats (Blander and Sander Nat Rev Immunol 2012), thus allowing for efficient pathogen clearance while minimizing inflammation-induced tissue damage. However, the cellular machinery that accurately assesses these infectious threats in humans as well as the precise contribution of bacterial factors is not well understood. To fill this gap, we hereby propose to obtain an unbiased and comprehensive view on the bacterial recognition and human response network. To achieve this, we will exploit a unique approach and perform a genome-wide screen using haploid human immune cells (Carette et al. Science 2009) in which genes will be disrupted at saturating scale using gene trap mutagenesis (Carette et al. Nat Biotechnol 2011). By subjecting mutagenized cell pools to a selection scheme (e.g. survival, inflammatory response, internalization of PAMPs), mutants with desired phenotypes will be enriched and identified by deep sequencing. Following the identification of cellular targets, we will verify the functional relevance of these molecules by obtaining and testing cells from the human gene trap mutant collection of individual clones. This unique haploid clone collection contains conditional alleles, is DNA barcoded and will be provided by our external collaboration partner Haplogen and via the Research Center for Molecular Medicine (Ce-M-M-; Austria). Furthermore, we will explore CRISPR (RNA programmable Cas9)-mediated genome editing (discovered by E. Charpentier’s group) (Deltcheva et al. Nature 2011; Jinek et al. Science 2012) that has recently been expanded to mammalian cells, to inactivate genes of interest in relevant human immune cells (Cong et al. Science 2013; Mali et al. Science 2013). Finally, the biological in vivo function of selected target molecules will be investigated in relevant mouse models of infectious diseases. Using these approaches, my specific project part will focus on the inflammatory response to the medically relevant pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes, and a selected set of PAMPs, such as cell wall extracts and bacterial nucleic acid preparations, known to signal threat to the host. The unique combination of expertise within our consortium, covering haploid genetic screens, RNA-programmable Cas9-mediated genome editing and proficiency in innate immune responses to bacterial pathogens and bacterial virulence strategies, provides a clear competitive advantage and the ideal setting to successfully apply this innovative and discovery driven strategy.

Preliminary data: Human HPCs (hHPCs) display a change in phenotype when subjected to hypoxia. Genes associated with Primary Cilia (PC), organelles exclusively present in cholangiocytes in the liver, display a significantly reduced expression following hypoxia. Length of biliary PC has been assessed in human livers declined for OLT. Length of PC decreases with prolonged warm and cold ischemia. These results have been confirmed in a murine model of liver procurement and cold storage. Hypothesis and Aims: IRI decreases the hHPCs` capacity to repair biliary injury via a mechanism involving PC. This study aims at modelling the development of BCs to understand their pathology and identify therapeutic targets. Methods: hHPCs have been extracted from livers declined for OLT, cultured in vitro and characterized. hHPCs will be used in functional IRI studies in vitro (hypoxia chamber, hydrogen peroxide) and analysed including RNA-sequencing. Findings will be confirmed ex vivo in human samples using liver protocol biopsies from transplanted grafts. Findings will be correlated with the clinical outcome. Functional studies will be performed. First in vitro by modifying the hHPCs using CrispR technology and then in vivo by transplantation of unmodified and modified hHPCs into a murine model of biliary disease. Outcomes: To enhance the understanding of the biochemical processes involved in biliary IRI and regeneration. Secondly, to identify therapeutic targets to treat/ prevent BCs to help redefine graft utilisation by improving graft quality and thus expand the clinical acceptance criteria for liver grafts.

Even non-cytolytic CD8+ T cell interactions, which purge viruses from neurons without triggering cell death, can induce permanent damage. Yet, how this immune response irreversibly disrupts neuronal homeostasis remains unclear. Here, we will elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underlie non-cytolytic CD8+ T cell engagement with infected neurons and their consequences on neuron function in vivo. We hypothesize that inflammatory signalling in neurons, induced by non-cytolytic CD8+ T cell interactions, triggers metabolic and epigenetic changes that underpin permanent neuronal dysfunction. "PATHOCODE" will test this hypothesis by harnessing a unique animal model of T cell-driven virus encephalitis in the following objectives: 1. Discern neuronal subset-specific vulnerabilities and antigen-dependent versus bystander effects in the inflamed CNS. We will perform single nucleus RNA sequencing to examine whether T cell engagement (a) differentially affects molecularly distinct neurons, and (b) affects non-targeted, uninfected neurons. 2. Uncover the consequences of non-cytolytic T cell engagement on neuronal metabolism. We will use cell-specific mitochondrial reporter mice to investigate immune-driven metabolic adaptation of neurons in vivo. 3. Determine how non-cytolytic T cell engagement affects the neuronal epigenome. We will employ cell-specific nucleus/ribosome reporter mice to elucidate how T cell engagement affects the translatome and epigenome of infected cells. 4. Rescue T cell-mediated neuronal dysfunction by restoring metabolic pathways. We will exploit recent CRISPR/Cas9 technological advances to restore neuronal gene expression and uncover the relevance of immune-driven metabolic and epigenomic changes to disease. Our study will thus provide novel molecular concepts about immune-driven neuronal alterations in CNS inflammatory diseases.	European Research Council	Consolidator Grant	1999954.0	EUR

Prioritized gene candidates will be firstly validated by gene knockdown in primary T cells from AS patients and healthy controls. The validated genes will then undergo second validation through CRISPR-knockout or gene overexpression. For 1-2 validated genes, in-depth mechanistic studies in relevant T cell subtypes will be performed. Key pathways related to validated genes will be identified through RNA-seq experiments of gene-silenced or knockout primary cells and scRNA-seq data mentioned above. Key proteins in the pathways will then be determined and validated through gene knockdown or knockout and relevant cellular assays. Potential applications: Proposed study will be the first to systematically investigate disease-associated genetic variants for the genes regulating T cell functions in AS. Data generated will provide functional explanations for AS-associated genetic loci, promote the understanding the AS pathogenesis, and potentially identify novel therapeutic targets for treatment of AS and other related arthritis.

452	Dr Daniel Bose	University of Sheffield	None	2019-06-01	2024-06-01	Dissecting the molecular basis of eRNA function.	Enhancers are regulatory non-coding DNA sequences that control cell-lineage and stimulus-specific transcription. Enhancers are transcribed into enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). eRNAs are important for regulating gene expression, but the mechanistic basis for this function remains unclear. I recently demonstrated that eRNAs can stimulate the catalytic activity of the key transcription regulator CBP to promote transcription, interactions which were widespread at enhancers across the genome. In this study, I will ask what is the mechanistic basis for eRNA function? Using multidisciplinary approaches, I will address three related but independent aims: 1) I will use biochemical assays, together with complementary techniques to probe RNA structure. Together with a mutagenesis study of eRNAs using CRISPR-Cas9 in cells, this will highlight the sequence and structural determinants of eRNA function; 2) I will map how different components of CBP regulatory complexes bind to eRNAs across the genome. Combined with methods to highlight eRNA structures bound to the complexes, this will uncover how eRNAs organise CBP complexes across the genome; 3) I will use cryo-EM to study the structure of CBP complexes bound to eRNAs, including developing new methods to facilitate these studies. In combination, these techniques will provide new insights into how eRNAs regulate gene expression.	Wellcome Trust	Sir Henry Dale Fellowship	1339467.0	GBP

The monoamine noradrenalin (norepinephrine) is a major neuromodulatory transmitter that promotes wakefulness and arousal and regulates autonomic functions. Until recently, noradrenalin signalling was considered to be specific to vertebrates. Our discovery of functional noradrenalin signalling in marine invertebrates has overturned this long-held view. In this project, we propose to investigate noradrenergic signalling in the larval stages of the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii, a laboratory animal and powerful new model for connectomics and circuit function. We will take advantage of the Platynereis system to obtain novel cellular-level insights into noradrenergic signalling through a systems-neuroscience approach. To analyse the functions of noradrenalin and its regulators at single-cell resolution, we will generate transgenic constructs and CRISPR-induced knockout lines and analyse wild-type, knockout and transgenic larvae with whole-brain activity imaging and various behavioural paradigms. We will establish whole-body wiring diagrams through serial EM reconstruction and map the components of noradrenergic signalling to the connectome. The use of this simple and accessible invertebrate genetic model will thus allow us to study noradrenergic signalling in unprecedented detail in a fully-mapped nervous system.

Preliminary data: Human HPCs (hHPCs) display a change in phenotype when subjected to hypoxia. Genes associated with Primary Cilia (PC), organelles exclusively present in cholangiocytes in the liver, display a significantly reduced expression following hypoxia. Length of biliary PC has been assessed in human livers declined for OLT. Length of PC decreases with prolonged warm and cold ischemia. These results have been confirmed in a murine model of liver procurement and cold storage. Hypothesis and Aims: IRI decreases the hHPCs` capacity to repair biliary injury via a mechanism involving PC. This study aims at modelling the development of BCs to understand their pathology and identify therapeutic targets. Methods: hHPCs have been extracted from livers declined for OLT, cultured in vitro and characterized. hHPCs will be used in functional IRI studies in vitro (hypoxia chamber, hydrogen peroxide) and analysed including RNA-sequencing. Findings will be confirmed ex vivo in human samples using liver protocol biopsies from transplanted grafts. Findings will be correlated with the clinical outcome. Functional studies will be performed. First in vitro by modifying the hHPCs using CrispR technology and then in vivo by transplantation of unmodified and modified hHPCs into a murine model of biliary disease. Outcomes: To enhance the understanding of the biochemical processes involved in biliary IRI and regeneration. Secondly, to identify therapeutic targets to treat/ prevent BCs to help redefine graft utilisation by improving graft quality and thus expand the clinical acceptance criteria for liver grafts.

Even non-cytolytic CD8+ T cell interactions, which purge viruses from neurons without triggering cell death, can induce permanent damage. Yet, how this immune response irreversibly disrupts neuronal homeostasis remains unclear. Here, we will elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underlie non-cytolytic CD8+ T cell engagement with infected neurons and their consequences on neuron function in vivo. We hypothesize that inflammatory signalling in neurons, induced by non-cytolytic CD8+ T cell interactions, triggers metabolic and epigenetic changes that underpin permanent neuronal dysfunction. "PATHOCODE" will test this hypothesis by harnessing a unique animal model of T cell-driven virus encephalitis in the following objectives: 1. Discern neuronal subset-specific vulnerabilities and antigen-dependent versus bystander effects in the inflamed CNS. We will perform single nucleus RNA sequencing to examine whether T cell engagement (a) differentially affects molecularly distinct neurons, and (b) affects non-targeted, uninfected neurons. 2. Uncover the consequences of non-cytolytic T cell engagement on neuronal metabolism. We will use cell-specific mitochondrial reporter mice to investigate immune-driven metabolic adaptation of neurons in vivo. 3. Determine how non-cytolytic T cell engagement affects the neuronal epigenome. We will employ cell-specific nucleus/ribosome reporter mice to elucidate how T cell engagement affects the translatome and epigenome of infected cells. 4. Rescue T cell-mediated neuronal dysfunction by restoring metabolic pathways. We will exploit recent CRISPR/Cas9 technological advances to restore neuronal gene expression and uncover the relevance of immune-driven metabolic and epigenomic changes to disease. Our study will thus provide novel molecular concepts about immune-driven neuronal alterations in CNS inflammatory diseases.	European Research Council	Consolidator Grant	1999954.0	EUR

Lateral meristems, which provide thickness to tree stems and other plant organs, include vascular cambium (produces xylem [wood] and phloem); and cork cambium (forms cork, a tough protective layer). We recently identified the molecular mechanism that specifies stem cells of vascular cambium. Unexpectedly, this same set of experiments revealed also novel aspects of the regulation of cork cambium, a meristem whose development has remained unknown. CORKtheCAMBIA aims to identify the stem cells of cork cambium and reveal how they mechanistically regulate plant organ thickening. Thus, stemming from these novel unpublished findings and my matching expertise on plant stem cells and lateral growth, the timing is perfect to discover the molecular mechanism underlying specification of stem cells of cork cambium. To identify the origin of stem cells of cork cambium, 1st-we will combine lineage tracing with a detailed molecular marker analysis. To deduce the cell dynamics of cork cambium, 2nd-we will follow regeneration of the stem cells after ablation of this meristem. To discover the molecular factors regulating the stem cell specification of cork cambium, 3rd-we will utilize molecular genetics and a novel method (inducible CRISPR/Cas9 mutant targeting) being developed in my lab. Since the lateral growth is orchestrated by two adjacent, nested meristems, cork and vascular cambia, the growth process must be tightly co-regulated. Thus, 4th-an in silico model of the intertwined growth process will be generated. By combining modelling with experimentation, we will uncover mechanistically how cork and vascular cambium coordinate lateral growth. CORKtheCAMBIA will thus provide long-awaited insight into the regulatory mechanisms specifying the stem cells of lateral meristem as whole, lay the foundation for studies on radial thickening and facilitate rational manipulation of lateral meristems of crop plants and trees.

Host immune responses can play either protective or a pathologic role during infection.Therefore, understanding of the regulatory networks and signaling pathways that determine the magnitude andquality of an individual's antiviral immune response has important implications for human health, since thesegenes/pathways could be therapeutically targeted to control viral replication, to treat aberrant immuneresponses, or they may represent targets for enhancing the safety and efficacy of vaccines against a widerange of viral pathogens.Polymorphic host genes and regulatory networks have a major impact on immune response variation in humanpopulations. However, confounding environmental factors and/or ethical concerns limit the types of studiesthat can be conducted in humans. Therefore, genetically tractable model systems that capture the range ofgenetic and phenotypic diversity seen in humans are needed to mechanistically dissect the genetics of immunevariation. To address this need, we have used the Collaborative Cross (CC), a highly diverse mouse geneticreference population, to identify and characterize polymorphic host genes that regulate baseline and IAV-induced innate and adaptive immunity. As part of this effort, we have quantified variation in virus-inducedinnate and adaptive immune responses and disease over a 45 day time-course (Days 2, 4, 7, 10, 15, 28, and45 post infection) in a panel of 110 CC RIX lines (reproducible F1 crosses between CC recombinant inbred(RI) lines that model heterozygous Human populations). This resource, when combined with othercomplementary Systems Genetics tools, such as the Diversity Outbred (DO) population and CRISPR-mediatedgenome editing, data sets comparing the host response to other pathogens that are being studied in thecontext of this U19, and the analysis of gene expression changes and genetic variations in IAV infected humanpatients, gives us the opportunity to: 1) identify polymorphic genes associated with IAV immune responsevariation, and test their impact on other aspects of the antiviral response or virus-induced disease process, 2)test how these genes impact responses to other viral pathogens, or function during allergy/auto-immunity, and3) test the impact of these genes in the context of human infections to identify targets for diagnosis, preventionand therapeutic interventions in humans.

458	Dr Gehmlich	Birmingham, University of	None	None	2021-08-31	Joint NC3Rs/BHF PhD Studentship: Use of induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes to test the consequences of genetic variants in atrial and ventricular arrhythmias (Dr Katja Gehmlich)	Inherited cardiac conditions are caused by genetic mutations in cardiac genes. They are the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in the young through ventricular arrhythmias and also contribute substantially to heart failure, putting a major burden on health care systems. To develop specific therapies, it is necessary to understand the consequences of the genetic mutations at the molecular level. Model systems, such as cells, organoids and whole organisms are used to elucidate disease pathways. The animal models among them have a high ethical burden, therefore there is a need to replace them by cellular models. Induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM) have emerged as a novel model system to study inherited heart conditions and thereby provide an opportunity to replace animal models, especially mice, to study these genetic diseases. The advantage of the iPSC-CM system is their human physiology (e.g. beating rates and ion channel setups) and that genetic mutations can be introduced via CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome-editing. However, immaturity of iPSCCM proves a major obstacle in their utilisation, but novel 3D culturing methods such as engineered heart tissue (EHT) have been shown to result in more mature characteristics of iPSC-CM. Titin truncation variants (TTNtv) are found in up to 25 % of patients suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy, one of the major inherited cardiac conditions. There is an increased burden of ventricular arrhythmias in these patients as well as a link of TTNtv and atrial fibrillation (a form of atrial arrhythmia), indicating that TTNtv can predispose to arrhythmias in both settings. The main scientific objective of the project is to develop iPSC-CM derived cellular model systems (both 2D and 3D) to study the predisposition to atrial and ventricular arrhythmias caused by mutations in cardiac genes. This will provide an alternative to in vivo mouse models commonly used, which can be highly invasive. TTNtv, linked to ventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation in humans, will be used as example mutations.	British Heart Foundation	Fellowship	90000.0	GBP
459	Dr Bowyer	University of Manchester	None	2020-01-01	2022-12-31	Development of an in vitro model to dissect the mechanism of fungal persistence in the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung	Cystic fibrosis is the most common fatal genetically inherited disease in Caucasian populations. This disease is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator gene (CFTR) which produces defective ion fluxes and calcium homeostasis in the epithelia. Patients with cystic fibrosis are therefore susceptible to recurrent and lethal lung infections including those caused by the fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. Animal models play a central role in the study of cystic fibrosis. Researchers have used mice, ferrets, pigs and sheep to model the inflammatory response seen in human patients with this disease. Although such models generate useful knowledge on the pathophysiology of this disease, animal models are limited for a number of reasons. One is the ethical concerns about the numbers of mice that needed to generate gene or tissue specific knock-outs which likely die early after birth. Additionally, mice, the most common vertebrate animal used, do not completely recapitulate the disease phenotypes seen in the human lung during infection and larger vertebrate such as sheep, pigs and ferrets are often used instead. The use of larger animals intrinsically have a number of limitations including housing space, high cost of the experimentations and the need to use very high number of animals to get enough statistical significance. In vitro cell culture systems using immortalised cystic fibrosis epithelial cells from donors have been developed to overcome those problems. However, genetic variability between healthy immortalised and cystic fibrosis cell lines prevents precise and statically useful comparison of events in CF and control cells which has limited them to be widely adopted by the community. Here we propose to establish a new in vitro model of isogenic cystic fibrosis and healthy controls bronchial epithelial cell lines carrying different CF mutations in the CFTR gene using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis of 16HBE bronchial cells. Using an established methodological approach developed in our laboratory including in vitro infection, confocal microscopy, expression analysis, cytokine measurements and competitive fitness analysis the student will be able to define critical stages of the interaction between the cystic fibrosis epithelia and A. fumigatus compared to healthy cells and the fungal factors governing this process. The successful completion of this project will achieve a number of scientific objectives. Firstly, the development of an isogenic cell culture system of epithelial cell lines will be of great value for researchers focused on the study of epithelia-pathogen interactions in cystic fibrosis without using any mice. Secondly, screening of A. fumigatus null libraries on CF epithelia will increase our knowledge on the pathogen factors leading persistence in the context of disease. Additionally, the student will be enrolled in a 3Rs focused programme that will give him/her the opportunity to enrol with industrial partners in Manchester and our fungal community to promote the implementation on this resource in other laboratories at an international level. As a PhD studentship we will also provide extensive training opportunities for a student, and the wider research community, on the importance of alternatives to replace animal testing.

460	Dr Charlotte Alston	The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust	None	2019-09-01	2023-08-31	Can muscle biopsy be avoided for paediatric patients with suspected mitochondrial disease?	Mitochondrial disease is an inborn error of metabolism with no cure; it affects at least 1 in 4300 births. Mitochondria produce cellular energy (ATP), and their dysfunction causes marked clinical heterogeneity, affecting any organ or tissue with energy demands e.g. brain or muscle. Symptoms can arise in adulthood or childhood but age at onset often correlates with severity; children with mitochondrial disease often have a poor prognosis and few survive into adulthood. A rapid genetic diagnosis delivers significant patient impact, facilitating clinical management and counselling for families with otherwise limited options.The diagnosis of mitochondrial disease is hindered by genetic heterogeneity; more than 1100 genes encode the mitochondrial proteome, including 280 known disease genes reported to date. The clinical and genetic heterogeneity necessitates a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis and this is delivered by the NHS-funded Highly Specialised Mitochondrial Diagnostic Service in Newcastle upon Tyne. The multidisciplinary diagnostic service is complemented by the translational research of the Wellcome Centre for Mitochondrial Research; I recently completed my NIHR-funded doctoral project across both centres. I successfully implemented a rapid targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) test (n=50 genes) that increased the genetic diagnosis rate to 50% (n=35) for a cohort of mitochondrial disease patients. Prenatal testing has already been undertaken for 13 couples as a consequence of my NIHR-funded research, demonstrating the impact of a genetic diagnosis.Our nationally-comissioned Highly Specialised mitochondrial diagnostic service receives 140 paediatric muscle biopsies annually; results from the functional analysis of muscle biopsy remains paramount for selecting appropriate candidate genes for sequencing analysis for genetic diagnosis. Muscle biopsy is invasive, expensive and requires critically ill children to undergo general anaesthetic and upon completion of the candidate gene analysis, many patients still remain without a genetic diagnosis. Our current diagnostic strategy (muscle biopsy proceeded by candidate gene sequencing) fails to genetically diagnose half of our paediatric cohort, and this needs to be addressed. This research proposal aims to do this by implementing whole exome sequencing of trios (affected patients and their parents) as a first line diagnostic genetic test, concurrently removing the requirement for muscle biopsy for these patients.Whole exome sequencing (WES) provides an unbiased strategy, whereby all candidate genes (n=1158) can be screened concurrently; through analysis of trios, phasing of variants and detection of sporadic variants becomes achievable. By using blood DNA, candidate gene selection is bypassed and removes the need for muscle biopsy.Muscle biopsy has historically been critical for functional studies, but emerging cell-based strategies such as CRISPR/Cas9 have demonstrated potential as a surrogate tissue and I propose to harness this technology to generate cellular models of patient mutations to investigate their clinical utility in the diagnostic setting. In the post-genomic era, the issue of classification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) requires increasing scientist time; development of novel systems to investigate pathogenicity will be paramount and this arm of the project seeks to future-proof our laboratory, ensuring we are prepared to cope with the VUS that emerge from our patients' NGS.

In order to extravasate into tissues, circulating leukocytes must first make rolling contacts with the vasculature before forming firm adhesions and subsequently transmigrating through the endothelium and basement membrane. These processes depend on the expression of integrins, which facilitate intercellular and cell-matrix interactions, and chemokines, which guide cell migration. Current studies are predominantly candidate-based and limited to broad neutralisation or gene deletion models, which prevents analysis of the intrinsic requirements of different cell types to infiltrate the diabetic milieu. Our approach will use genetic screening and natural genetic variants to unravel the specific molecular pathways that need to be targeted to prevent diabetogenic immune cell entry in pancreatic tissue. We will use two complementary systematic approaches to identify key pathways facilitating immune cell entry into pancreatic tissue: ProCode CrispR screening and Collaborative Cross natural variant screening. The ProcCode CrispR approach uses transfection of gRNA-lentiviruses, each with a unique protein barcode, to generate a mouse that has a mosaic population of leukocytes with representations of multiple different knockout lines. We can use this system to simultaneously screen for the functional role of all known integrins, adhesion molecules, chemokine receptors and matrix remodelling enzymes in each defined leukocyte population entering the tissues. Collaborative Cross studies compare >200 inbred mouse strains with defined parentage from eight diverse founder strains. By qualitatively and quantitatively assessing pancreatic infiltrate in these strains, we can use the predefined genetics to identify the molecular mediators down to the gene level.

Despite being one of the first molecular diseases to have its pathophysiology characterised, the management of beta-thalassaemia is far from optimal, limited to supportive therapy for the majority. We know that the unbalanced production of globin chains and subsequent excess of alpha-globin chains are the central causative factors in the pathophysiology of this condition. Currently, most attempts to ameliorate beta-thalassaemia aim to resolve globin imbalance by increasing gamma-globin production. In this project we aim to take a complementary approach; the reduction of excess alpha-globin chains, as natural reductions of alpha-globin output, in the form of co-inherited alpha-thalassaemia, ameliorate the disease phenotype in beta-thalassaemia patients. To achieve this reduction, the major regulatory element controlling alpha-globin expression will be deleted using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Proof-of-principle experiments have demonstrated the efficacy of this approach. We hope to develop the efficient editing of long term repopulating haematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) and have two complimentary aims: 1) To optimise gene-editing of the MCS-R2 enhancer by identifying the key sequences that need to be disrupted to achieve the ideal level of alpha-globin knock-down. This will be done through generating a guide-RNA library to edit various transcription factor binding sites, using a newly developed Cas9 derivative that allows for flexibility in the PAM specificities required for CRISPR/Cas9 editing. 2) To identify which sub-population of stem cells have long-term repopulating ability. Evidence suggests that the CD49f+ fraction of CD34+ cells are enriched in LT-HSCs. We will use a xenograft mouse model to evaluate whether improved editing efficiency and long-term repopulation can be achieved by editing this purified CD49f+ sub-population alone.

463	Dr Ines Cebola	Imperial College London	None	2020-06-01	2022-05-31	Investigation of NAFLD-associated epigenetic dysregulation	This proposal aims to gain insights into the transcriptional and regulatory defects that associate with hepatic steatosis. To this end, we will: 1) Identify steatosis-responsive enhancers in human hepatocytes; 2) Link steady-state and stress-responsive hepatocyte enhancers to target genes; 3) Implement CRISPR/Cas9 editing tools in primary human hepatocytes for disease modelling. Currently, there is a lack of high-resolution maps of transcriptional enhancers for human liver, particularly of those that are stimuli- and stress-responsive. Given the enrichment of common disease genetic risk variants within transcriptional enhancers, this gap in knowledge may be limiting our power to prioritise and investigate causal variants that affect liver cell function. Here, we propose to expose human primary hepatocyte spheroids to pathophysiological concentrations of free fatty acids, carbohydrates and insulin, which were previously shown to induce changes in a select number of genes and induce lipogenesis, consistent with a steatosis-like hepatic state. We will apply RNA-seq and ATAC-seq to identify differentially active enhancers in hepatic spheroids with steatosis, which we will link to target genes by correlation analysis. The epigenomic maps will be integrated with metabolic trait genetic association datasets. As proof-of-principle, we will select and target one steatosis-modulated enhancer with CRISPR/Cas9 in human hepatocytes. Functional outcomes will be evaluated by qPCR and intracellular lipid quantification by FACS (BODIPY). This project is intended to provide proof-of-principle evidence that there is rewiring of the hepatic enhancer landscape in NAFLD-associated conditions. Furthermore, it is designed to lay the groundwork for future high-throughput liver cell enhancer functional screens.	The Academy of Medical Sciences	Springboard Round 5	99964.63	GBP
464	Dr Rebecca Coll	Queen's University Belfast	None	2020-07-01	2022-06-30	Investigating the regulation of the human NLRP3 inflammasome	The NLRP3 inflammasome is a central cause of damaging inflammation in many chronic diseases which are a large, and increasing, burden on public health. Atherosclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, asthma, liver disease, and arthritis are all associated with NLRP3 activation, and NLRP3 inhibition has been effective in pre-clinical models of these diseases. NLRP3 inhibitors are now entering clinical trials, so a comprehensive understanding NLRP3 regulation in humans is absolutely critical to the advancement of anti-inflammatory therapies that target this pathway. My preliminary data indicate that there is a phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent signal that negatively regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation in human but not mouse macrophages. PI3K signalling has not previously been linked to NLRP3 activation and in order to study this mechanism I will exploit a human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived macrophage model (iMac). Utilising the iMac model platform will allow me to employ CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene editing to examine the functional relevance of candidate NLRP3 phosphorylation sites that may be regulated by PI3K signalling. This will be complimented by a focused screening approach combining both a small molecule inhibitor screen, and a phosphorylated protein antibody array, to map the PI3K-dependent signalling pathway that regulates NLRP3. Hits from this screen will be functionally confirmed in iMacs using the CRISPR/Cas9 approach. Importantly, PI3K inhibitors are in clinical use in oncology and their potential impact on NLRP3-dependent inflammation is not understood. This project will identify novel targets that regulate NLRP3-dependent inflammation, paving the way for the development of new PI3K pathway-targeted anti-inflammatory therapies.

465	Dr Katherine Bull	University of Oxford	Cellular and Molecular Physiology	2018-02-26	2022-02-25	An investigation into the genetic and functional basis of proteinuric kidney disease	The aim of the project is to discover novel genetic causes of renal disease, in the process developing and characterising models to link genes to function at the cellular and whole animal level. These models will provide an opportunity to examine the molecular basis of kidney disease and therefore a secondary aim is to develop tools to explore the transcriptomic profile of affected cells and tissues, linking genes to function. Proteinuria is a hallmark of many kidney diseases and indicates dysfunction of the glomerular filtration barrier, and in particular podocyte loss and de-differentiation. Genetic manipulation of podocytes has been historically challenging due to their terminal differentiation and resistance to transfection. The project will optimise methods for precise CRISPR gene editing in immortalised podocytes, and apply these to generate both CRISPR podocyte lines and murine models mimicking human variants. Functional validation tools are increasingly needed to establish causation for many rare variants identified in large scale whole genome sequencing projects. The project will begin with variants identified using whole genome sequencing in a national cohort of patients with severe nephrotic disease (NephroS, University of Bristol). Access to cells and tissues from the in vitro and in vivo models provides an opportunity to study the pathways and mechanisms by which the human genetic variants lead to clinical phenotypes. The outcomes of this research will be novel genetic insights into kidney disease, the development of clinically relevant tools to model and test for the effects human genetic variation on renal pathology, and discoveries and methods that will improve the diagnosis and treatment of human disease.
